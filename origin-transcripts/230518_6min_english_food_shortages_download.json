Some see these food supply problems, which were caused by unusually cold weather combined with rising energy prices, as a warning not to take a reliable supply for food for granted."

In this programme, we’ll be finding out, and as usual, learning some useful, new vocabulary as well."

In the UK, many farmers are selling their apple orchards to housing developers rather than struggle with increasing production costs.

A glasshouse is a large greenhouse – a building with glass sides used for the commercial growing of fruit and vegetables. A polytunnel is a similar structure but made using plastic instead of glass."

When global demand for food outgrows supply, countries start competing with each other. According to Oxford University’s, Professor Charles Godfrey, an expert on the global food system, we’re now living in a less connected, less collaborative world, a world which he says is ‘de-globalising’."

My view is that if we plan our land use in a canny way, one can produce more food, and one can increase the biodiversity in the country."
