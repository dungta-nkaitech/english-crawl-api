So, according to this definition, which animal is the most efficient? Is it:"

And that crouched posture is really typical of most animals. Humans have a very straight leg, and so because of that, and because our legs are pretty long for our body size – humans are part of the ape family – we’re are efficient."

One big difference however is that humans walk upright on straight legs, whereas most animals are crouched – bent over at the knee and leaning forwards to the ground. This crouched posture is not an efficient way to move."

The main reason, according to Loughborough University physiologist, Rhona Pearce, is training. But there may be other factors too, as she explained to BBC World Service’s, CrowdScience."

    "text": "Age probably comes into it in that there’s probably an optimal age for tendon elasticity – that drops off as you get older, so probably there’s a sweet spot in age for running economy. So, in terms of weight, it depends what you weight is made up of, if you’ve got more muscle mass that’s going to help you, whereas if it’s more fat then you’ve got to carry it."

And from the evidence it looks like my answer to your question was right, Sam."
