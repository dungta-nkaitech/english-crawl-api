The 2021 UK census reported that three quarters of adults in Britain are worried about the impact of climate change, and it’s a worry that’s shared by the young. According to a survey by Greenpeace, what percentage of young people worldwide say they feel worried about climate change? Is it:"

If we change our road infrastructure to enable more walking and cycling, again we have fewer…  fossil fuel being burned but also, we know that walking and cycling are very good for mental health. If we can change our road layout and create more urban greenspaces, we already know that green and blue spaces are good for mental health."

It’s a high percentage which is not surprising considering that it’s future generations who will live with the consequences of what we do, or fail to do, today.
