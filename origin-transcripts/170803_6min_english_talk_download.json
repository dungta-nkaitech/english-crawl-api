    "text": "Yes. Therapy means a type of treatment for a problem or illness.

So people get less depressed and they get less anxious, and it seems to be regardless of what type of intervention is engaged in.

And you said Sigmund Freud, which is the right answer, so well done, Neil! Psychoanalysis was invented in the early 1890s by Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud. The patient lies on a couch and talks about their thoughts, feelings and dreams while the therapist listens. Psychoanalytic sessions typically last 50 minutes and take place 4 to 5 times a week."
