    "text": "I’m not really in favour of bucket lists. There are a couple of reasons. Most of all, you’re kind of fooling yourself with a bucket list. We fear death, more than I think we fear anything else in our existence, because we can’t predict it, and because we don’t know what it’s like because nobody comes back and tells us. And when you create a bucket list – something to do before you ‘kick the bucket’,the idea that you’re giving yourself is that you can somehow control when and what death is going to be all about. We only make sense of our lives at the end of it. A bucket list takes you away from the chance to be spontaneous and I think it’s so delicious to be able to say, ‘that’s an opportunity? – oh, I’ll do that!’"
