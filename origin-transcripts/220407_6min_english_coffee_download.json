It was made by boiling raw coffee beans, and apparently tasted awful! In this programme, we’ll be looking into the history of coffee in Britain, and as usual, we’ll be learning some related vocabulary too. But before that, I have a question for you. The earliest coffee to arrive in Britain took its name from the port in Yemen it was shipped from. So, what was it called? Was it:"

So, there were coffee shacks and carts like these sort of little street carts that you get still in London, and you get all over New York, that is a cheap, quick drinks to perk you up.

It declined seriously and has never fully recovered even in the current coffee boom."

One is the world of corporate coffee, the coffee chains existing on a low wage economy. So, you have that kind of mass coffee market on the one hand. One the other hand you have these microlot estates, Fairtrade coffee, the sort of hipster coffee which is as varied and as interesting as fine wines and is made in an artisanal way."
