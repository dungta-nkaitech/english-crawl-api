    "speaker": "lethalhigh-density",
    "text": "Well, it’s a fairly predictable thing a historian would say but change and widespread diseases are nothing new. Our ancestors all lived through big pandemics, some of them which were much more lethal than coronavirus. And one of the products of living together in high-density populations, going back as far as historical records go, is you find there are transitions of disease from animals to human beings and they inflict damage. And that damage typically you measure in mortality rates but then the economic and social consequences of disease. There’s a lot of examples in history to learn from."

  {
    "order": 18,
    "speaker": "high-density",
    "text": "One reason Peter gives for this is the high-density of populations, meaning people living together in buildings very close to one another. In olden days this included living together with animals, making the transmission of disease to humans much easier."

    "text": "Well, your geographical position in the world matters – if you’re if you’re geographically peripheral like Scandinavia or New Zealand, then you have a different dose, a different level of connectivity with the rest of the world. If you’re a country like the UK which is the centre of all global flight routes, then the incidence of people going backwards and forwards, in and out of your country - you’re going to spread and catch much quicker. The scorecard is very mixed and there’ve been some democratic systems that have been extremely resilient and robust at anticipating it and some that have got it wrong."

    "speaker": "Neil",
    "text": "You said the ancient Silk Roads ran, c) from Asia to Europe which was… correct! They ran from Japan and the Far East through Asia and the Middle East, bringing trade and spices as well as new ideas and languages to Europe."
