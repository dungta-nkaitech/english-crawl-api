What world does she say you are part of?"

You do have that image but having said that I would also add that those images appear typically very sexualised, very stylised. So yes she's empowered but she's in a skintight catsuit. You also get another type which is the female rider but who's been masculinised. She's kind of embodying a very masculine kind of style. And I think the third type is kind of silly, giggly female on a scooter."

So there don't seem to be many really completely positive images of women and motorcycles, at least not in the popular media. Time to look again at today’s vocabulary, but first, let’s have the answer to the quiz question. In which decade was the first mass-produced motorcycle released? Was it:"
