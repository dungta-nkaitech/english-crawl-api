Of course, you know, the science is so advanced now… very much in the past, the science would say, yes we think, perhaps… we perhaps have these models… now we have the exact science, so it is an absolutely different ball game… we actually know what to do now. It is about getting on with it, and the young people are the furthest ahead in this they can see the future as theirs and they’re impassioned to do something about it."

For example, if someone gives you a birthday present you might say, ‘What a nice surprise!’"

And also, you know, at the moment the government is trying to reach net zero by 2050 and all that, and they committed to creating 2 million new green jobs. Now, if young people and activists think about this… if you have a green job you're actually dedicating your entire working life to building a green sustainable future, and that has a huge effect on your psychology."
