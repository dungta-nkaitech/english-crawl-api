    "text": "For years scientists have debated how life started on our planet. Billions of years ago, long before the dinosaurs, animals or even plants existed, the Earth had a watery environment of oxygen-free gases and chemicals known as the primordial soup. It had the potential for life to develop, but something was missing."

Astronomer, Professor Melissa McClure, worked with the Nasa scientists who found ice on Europa, one of Jupiter’s moons. Here she explains to BBC World Service programme, Science in Action, one theory linking ice to the beginnings of life on Earth."

    "text": "There's sort of these two alternatives for how you could have had life arise on Earth, and one is that the very basic building blocks, like water, and methane, and CO2 – like, those molecules were definitely brought to Earth by ices in comets, and maybe once they were on Earth, then they reacted with either geothermal heat or some kind of lightning strike to form more complex molecules."

    "text": "Exactly how this happened is not known, but it involves biomolecules, molecules like DNA which are found in living things. Ice is not a biomolecule, but when it mixes with carbon, the atoms in ice molecules change to produce complex molecules – and that’s when interesting things start to happen. Here’s Professor McClure again, explaining more to BBC World Service’s, Science in Action."

    "text": "If they have a carbon atom in them then they’re complex organic molecules, so things like very simple alcohols like methanol or ethanol, like what you would drink, are complex organic molecules. And these molecules could react and start a sort of a reaction chain that would eventually lead to something like a biomolecule."

    "speaker": "organicorganic",
    "text": "Ice can react with other elements to create organic molecules, for example the alcohol, methanol. Here, the adjective organic means related to living plants and animals. That’s different from how we use the word to talk about ‘organic food’, meaning food that hasn’t been grown using artificial chemicals."

    "speaker": "chain reaction",
    "text": "When these organic molecules met the primordial soup - so the theory goes - it produced a chain reaction – a series of chemical reactions in which one change causes another. It was this chain reaction which created the first living cells and eventually, humans. Quite impressive for a little piece of frozen water!"

    "text": "Which was the right answer, Neil! Each molecule of water, and ice, contains two atoms of H, that’s hydrogen, joined to one atom of oxygen. OK, let’s recap the vocabulary we’ve learned from the programme, starting with primordial soup – the environment on Earth before there were any plants or animals, which created the conditions for life."
