    "speaker": "Neil",
    "text": "Jealousy can lead to controlling behaviour, like checking your partner’s text messages or monitoring who they see, behaviour which damages relationships. But unlike other psychological problems such as anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder, many do not feel brave enough to ask for help with their jealousy."

And also, at the same time increasing activities or behaviours that harmonise with how you want to become."
