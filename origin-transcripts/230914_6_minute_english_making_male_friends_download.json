So why do we sometimes find it hard to make friends, or that the friends we used to have seemed to have somehow drifted away? Now, there is an idea that women are much better at maintaining their friendships, and that men are more likely to hang out with whoever is around rather than to nurture those relationships, and we were wondering whether this was really true or is that just a stereotype?"
