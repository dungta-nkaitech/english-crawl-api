These mistakes, sometimes called misfires -when things do not work in the way intended - have damaged the reputation of opinion pollsters. In this programme we’ll be taking a look into the opinion polling industry and, of course, learning some useful new vocabulary as well."

Making accurate election predictions depends on polling a sample group of people who accurately represent the population as a whole. One of the reasons for pollsters failure to predict Trump’s election in 2016 is that they didn’t ask enough white, non-college educated voters."
