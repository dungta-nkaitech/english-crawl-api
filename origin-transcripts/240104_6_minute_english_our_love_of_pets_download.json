It's said that your personality is reflected in your pet – an animal that you keep in your home as a companion and treat kindly. ‘Dog people’ are supposed to be friendly, enthusiastic and loyal, whereas ‘cat people’ are introverted, proud and sensitive. Are you a ‘dog person’ or a ‘cat person’, Neil?"

So what percent of dogs and cats in the UK do you think have their own social media profile? Is it:"

Cats using Instagram and dogs on TikTok may be a strange new development, but our relationship with pets has continually changed throughout history. In the 1800s, people started using the word ‘pet’ to describe the emotional connection they felt to a special animal, and gradually it became normal to keep pets indoors."

But I think in British culture, in the 19th century in particular, home and family are increasingly celebrated, and keeping a pet becomes a way of bringing animals into your home life, and also really expressing what it means to be part of the family - animals become part of that."
