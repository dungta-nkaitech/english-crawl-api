    "text": "Often lust comes first, but not always. For some people who are asexual, it may not happen at all. But for those who do experience lust, it’s driven by the hormones oestrogen and testosterone. It may feel purely carnal, but in fact it's about the urge to mate and pass on your DNA via offspring. Without lust, it's fair to say our species would not survive."

    "text": "Helen Fisher thinks the first aspect of love is purely physical – lust, the strong feeling of sexual desire for someone. Lust is driven by the hormones oestrogen in women, and testosterone in men. A few people are asexual, meaning they don’t feel sexual attraction for anyone of any gender."

    "text": "The second aspect of romantic love is attraction, influenced by a neurotransmitter called dopamine. This is a feel-good substance released in our brain that is involved in driving us towards reward. Do something, get a dopamine hit, feel good. Eventually dopamine will push us toward repeating that behaviour. This is why intense attraction feels like an addiction to another human being. Some people get stuck in that loop, always chasing the dopamine-soaked excitement of a new relationship."

    "text": "This time, the hormone responsible is dopamine, a neurotransmitter that rewards our attraction to someone with pleasurable feelings. That’s why dopamine is called a feel-good substance. The adjective feel-good can be used to describe anything causing happy and optimistic feelings about life, things like feel-good films or feel-good music."

    "text": "Here, though, there’s a downside. The dopamine ‘hit’ of sexual attraction feels so good, we crave it more and more. Some people are always chasing the next relationship to get a new ‘hit’ of pleasure, and soon become stuck in a loop – an idiom meaning they’re unable to break the habit of repeating the same patterns of behaviour over and over again."
