In this programme, we’re talking about what women eat and drink in the first few weeks after having a baby. And, as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."

Giving birth is not called ‘labour’ for nothing – it’s hard work, leaving the new mum physically and emotionally exhausted, and in need of food that’s nourishing, for both herself and her baby.
