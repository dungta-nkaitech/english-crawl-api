But moving on now, we've discussed one disadvantage of digital news – that it can be hard to distinguish a real story from a fake one – given the mass of information available on the web. So maybe you should tell us about the advantages, Neil."

    "text": "It doesn't matter whether your local journalist produces news on a tablet, on a mobile phone, in print, online, on television, or on radio. What matters is that there should be a diversity of journalism available and that it should be provided by professional reporters whose job is to do an honest objective job, impartially, in the public interest, not simply to rant or express opinions."

    "text": "Tim Luckhurst there. He says that news will be successful on any platform – digital or traditional – so long as reporters are honest and objective in their pursuit of a good story. If you're objective it means you aren't influenced by personal feelings or opinions. If you rant you speak in an angry opinionated way about something."

    "speaker": "Alex Cox, researcher at genealogy website, findmypast.co.uk",
    "text": "During the First World War local papers always printed In Memoriam columns where they'd list local dead. What a lot of them also did was they allowed relatives to submit short poems about their deceased loved ones and some of them were five or six lines – not very long – but they're really, really quite powerful. And the paper dedicated page space to print not just one of these, but multiple, and I don't know whether a modern paper would even consider doing that today."
