    "speaker": "Dr Dean Burnett, neuroscientist at Cardiff University, UK",
    "text": "The sensory information is just relayed directly into your brain. One part of it is routed into the cortex, where it's sort of thought about: 'that's that thing, I know that from last time I experienced this', and you can kind of rationalise your way through it. But it also sends a message directly to the amygdala, which immediately triggers the 'fight or flight' response – bang, fire alarm, off it goes, flood the body just in case. It's a survival mechanism."

    "speaker": "Sophie",
    "text": "That's right – Or for me, it's a dog getting anywhere near me! Anyway, this information goes into our brains and is processed in two different parts of the brain – the central cortex and the amygdala."
  },
  {
    "order": 21,
    "speaker": "Neil",
    "text": "And the information sent to the central cortex triggers a rational response, like, oh it's only a harmless moth – and the stuff that goes to the amygdala triggers an instinctive reaction – the fight or flight response – like, aaarrrggghhh! It's a disgusting moth! Get away from me!"

    "order": 22,
    "speaker": "fight or flight response",
    "text": "The fight or flight response is a normal response to stress or danger, and it involves the hormone adrenalin being pumped quickly round the body. The problem is this response can get triggered when there isn't any danger. And this is at the heart of what a phobia is."

    "text": "Yes, but recent research has shown that we have a reflexive awareness of spiders – whether we fear them or not – which means we can spot them automatically without thinking about it. And we don't have the same reflexive awareness of houseflies – or moths – for example."
  },

    "order": 33,
    "speaker": "Neil",
    "text": "I expect this awareness is to do with our ancestors. It would've been extremely useful to spot a spider as an early human on the plains of the African Savannah. A bite might kill you – or make you vulnerable to attack from other animals."

Entomophobia (also known as insectophobia) is a specific phobia characterized by an excessive or unrealistic fear of one or more classes of insect. Thanatophobia is the fear of death and pogonophobia is the fear of beards or bearded people."
