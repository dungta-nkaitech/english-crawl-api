But recently some scientists, especially in the west, have been focusing on another issue: the increasing number of people in the world, something known as overpopulation. In this programme, we’ll be discussing the controversial link between overpopulation and climate change. And as usual we’ll be learning some new vocabulary, as well."

    "text": "OK, Neil, I’ll reveal the answer later in the programme. Since climate change is caused by human activities, it seems common sense that fewer people would mean lower carbon emissions. But in fact the connection isn’t so simple. Not everyone emits carbon equally, and people in the western world produce far more than people in sub-Saharan Africa or Asia."
