  },
  {
    "order": 34,
    "speaker": "Catherine",
    "text": "Thanks for the advice, Rob. And our next word is 'cycle' – that's where one event leads to another, and then often repeats itself. For example, 'I'm in a bad cycle of going to bed late, then oversleeping in the morning.'"

    "speaker": "Catherine",
