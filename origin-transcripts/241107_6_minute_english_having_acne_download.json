Acne is a skin condition which can affect anyone. It often happens between the ages of 14 and 19, but can continue into adulthood. There are many types of acne from blackheads and whiteheads to more severe forms of cysts and scarring."

In this programme, we’ll be hearing from a skin doctor, or dermatologist, who suffered acne herself. And, as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new vocabulary too."

    "text": "Well, we know for sure that it does tend to arise from puberty onwards, so the biggest cohort of patients is in the teenage age group. However a proportion of patients up to 20 or so percent - certainly in females - it will persist well into the 30s, 40s - much longer than people often give it credit for. And we also know that it has a huge psychological impact so even mild to moderate acne, because it affects teenagers who are quite emotionally vulnerable, it affects their friendships, their peer groups and so it should never really be trivialised."

    "text": "Of course, puberty involves emotional, as well as physical, changes. Acne can be harder to live with for someone who is emotionally vulnerable, meaning someone who gets their feelings hurt easily. Acne affects your confidence and how you interact with the world, so it shouldn’t be trivialised, or made to seem less important than it really is."
