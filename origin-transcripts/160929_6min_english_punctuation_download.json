    "text": "Moving on now, punctuation was invented by the Ancient Greeks. They used a series of dots to indicate different lengths of pauses. A short unit of text was a comma, a longer unit was a colon, and a complete sentence was a periodos. We used these terms to name our punctuation marks – although they actually refer to the clauses not to the dots themselves."

    "text": "Punctuation started off being all about rhetoric – about speech – but we started to assign rules, I think around about the 8th century or so. We started to associate the marks, not just with pauses, but with the actual grammatical units that were used to punctuate. So, a comma wasn't just a dot that meant, pause for this length of time. It now actually marked out a clause, you know, it marked out a sort of consistent logical bit of writing."

    "order": 23,
    "speaker": "rhetoric",
    "text": "So rhetoric – or the art of persuasive speaking – was very important to the Greeks and to the Romans. And to be persuasive, you need to be understood. And these little punctuation marks helped the speaker to deliver their text more effectively."

  {
    "order": 24,
    "speaker": "clause",
    "text": "Later on, these marks were given grammatical functions. The comma marks out a clause – or grammatical unit containing a subject and a verb – as well as telling the reader to pause briefly."
