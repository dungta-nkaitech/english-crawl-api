They are produced by a so-called body clock in our brains that regulates our body functions: our body temperature, sleepiness and alertness, hunger, and hormone levels. Plants, animals, and many microbes have circadian rhythms."

    "text": "No, it isn't – take jet lag, for example. We rely on the predictable cycle of light or dark in a 24-hour period to synchronise – or adjust – our body clocks to the environment – and if we mess about with the light and dark cycle by flying into a new time zone, it makes us feel really bad!"

    "order": 19,
    "speaker": "jet lag",
    "text": "Good point – jet lag is the disruption of our circadian rhythms caused by high-speed travel across different time zones, which can cause tiredness and sleep problems. But Alice, if we rely on day turning to night to adjust our body clocks, what happens to blind people? – Because I assume their body clocks can't do this."

But those who have no light perception at all… well, let's listen now to Debra Skene, Professor of Neuroendocrinology at the University of Surrey. She can explain what happens."

    "text": "Totally blind people – they've lost that connection between the light-dark circle and the clock. So there isn't anything wrong with the clock but the clock ticks and oscillates at its own endogenous period just the same as if I were to put you in a dark cave. Your biological internal clock would oscillate at your endogenous circadian period."
  },
  {
    "order": 22,
    "speaker": "endogenous",
    "text": "So if you're totally blind – or able to see but living in a dark cave – you have a ticking clock but with no connection to the outside world. The clock oscillates at its own endogenous, or internal, period."

    "speaker": "Alice",
    "text": "It isn't a competition, Neil. And actually, mine probably ticks faster than yours since I'm a morning person. Anyway, the normal range in humans is between 23.8 to 24.8 hours. And this is also true for totally blind people."
  },
  {
    "order": 26,
    "speaker": "Neil",
    "text": "But their clocks are free-running – they don't get cues from the outside environment telling them when to wake up, when to eat, when to feel sleepy. So that means they might feel sleepy at the wrong time of day – for example, when they're at work. Or alert in the middle of the night when they should be asleep."

  },
  {
    "order": 28,
    "speaker": "Neil",
    "text": "Shift workers may suffer similar problems to blind people because they are trying to sleep against the clock. They might sleep in the day and work at night for example – which goes against the light-dark pattern."
