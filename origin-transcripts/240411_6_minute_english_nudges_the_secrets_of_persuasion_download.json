So in this programme, we’ll be asking whether the idea behind nudging - to influence human behaviour for good - is still true today. And, as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."

Another example of nudging happened in Woolwich, an area of London which in 2011 had a problem with anti-social behaviour, and particularly with shop windows being smashed. The local authority decided to use nudging to fix the problem by painting pictures on the shop windows, but what did they paint? Was it:"
