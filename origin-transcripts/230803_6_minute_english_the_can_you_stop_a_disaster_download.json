Often this additional harm, things like the spread of diseases or destroyed roads and buildings, are worse than the disaster itself. Fortunately, ways to limit the damage are within our grasp. If something is within your grasp it is very likely that you will achieve it."

An earthquake in the middle of the ocean is less of a disaster than in a populated city, so one technological solution involves computers mapping geological movements to identify places at risk. But low-tech solutions can be just as effective."
