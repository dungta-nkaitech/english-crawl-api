Now, and also coupled with the fact that here on Earth we're finding that life in very primitive form exists in the most extreme environments, these are the so called 'extremophiles' that exist at the bottom of the oceans… So life is much, much tougher."

So, scientists would love to think water flows on Mars but the evidence isn't strong enough for this to be certain. The other interesting point the professor makes is that life may exist in the very harsh Martian environment – because primitive life exists in extreme places on Earth."

But on Mars they would be living underground because the radiation – or light and heat – from the Sun would kill any organisms living on the surface of the planet.
