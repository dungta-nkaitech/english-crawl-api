    "text": "OK, Sam. I’ll reveal the answer later in the programme. If artists’ brains are different, it could mean they see the world in unusual ways. Dr Rebecca Chamberlain is a researcher in the neuroscience of art. She investigates how artists see the objects they are drawing by measuring saccades – the rapid movements our eyes make as they jump from one thing to another. Here she shares her findings with BBC World Service programme, CrowdScience."

    "text": "Artists seem to be processing the visual world in a different way to non-artists, particularly when they’re drawing. The artist actually takes a more global approach to looking – so they make bigger saccades, bigger eye movements, and shorter fixations on the image. So, it’s almost like they’re getting much more of a kind of gist level view of the thing they’re looking at."

In my case, I learned how to do those things without anyone telling me, you know like, if you are drawing the face, the human face, the distance between your eyes is the same as one of your eyes."

Still, some scientists think there may be third possibility: everyone’s brain works by focussing on some areas and ignoring others, making a kind of jigsaw puzzle with missing pieces. Maybe all of us – you, me, Mozart and Jimi Hendrix - are just filling in the missing pieces our own way."
