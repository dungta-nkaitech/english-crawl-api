    "speaker": "Legal tender",

    "speaker": "Dan",
    "text": "Well, no. You see, even though Bitcoin is not regulated by a bank or government, it still has a process that stops people from cheating. There are only two ways to get bitcoins. You either trade them from someone, or you go mining."
  },

That means that investors believe Bitcoin, which started the year worth under 1000 dollars will continue to rise in value, albeit at a slower rate.  But at the big banks there’s still plenty of scepticism about the currency."
  },
