    "speaker": "Neil",
    "text": "Well, I'll give the answer later in the programme. Now let me explain more about food and photos. These days, how well a dish – that's a noun for food prepared for eating – is photographed can matter more than how it actually tastes."

    "order": 15,
    "speaker": "Rob",
    "text": "And I suppose social media platforms are the best way for sharing food photos on, aren't they? And I have been guilty of taking a picture of my food on my smartphone – but only when eating some amazing food at a posh restaurant."

They spoke to several influential Instagrammers and bloggers – influential means having the power to make people change what they think. Here's one of them – Rebecca Milford, who edits a website called Bar Chick. What does she think about this new trend?"

    "speaker": "clichepresentable",
    "text": "It sounds very cliche that a picture speaks a thousand words but it really does and I've got friends now that instead of doing what you used to do and going on to the website of a restaurant to see what they were serving, then you'd go onto their Instagram account and check out their images, and choose what you want to eat literally based on what you're seeing. So it has to be presentable I suppose."

    "speaker": "cliche",

  },
  {
    "order": 21,
    "speaker": "cliche",
    "text": "Yes – and even if it is a cliche – it is so true. You describe a fantastic meal in a long blog but you can quickly see how it looks from a picture and then create an idea in your mind of how it tastes. So when you're promoting food, a photo is everything."
  },
  {
    "order": 22,
    "speaker": "Neil",
    "text": "And that's why some restaurants pay PR companies, lots of money to take stylish photos that can be shared on social media. It's like a fashion photoshoot for food."

    "speaker": "presentablerestaurateur,",
    "text": "Yes and Rebecca said the food has to be presentable – that's looking good enough for people to see – because people are making choices on what they see. I've also heard that some chefs and restaurateurs have adjusted their menus to produce meals that look good on a smartphone camera. A restaurateur, by the way, is the name of a person who owns and manages a restaurant."
  },
  {
    "order": 24,
    "speaker": "Neil",
    "text": "Now, while there is a risk that good-looking food on social media accounts, such as Instagram, might not match how it tastes, there is a theory your brain might trick you in to thinking it does tastes good. The You and Yours programme also heard from Professor Charles Spence, an Experimental Psychologist from Oxford University, about how this happens…"

    "speaker": "artisticallyexpectations",
    "text": "We see the food first, or the drink in the glass, and our brain's already imagining what it's going to taste like. And the more beautifully it's presented, the more artistically, that sets better expectations and they kind of carry over and anchor the tasting experience."
