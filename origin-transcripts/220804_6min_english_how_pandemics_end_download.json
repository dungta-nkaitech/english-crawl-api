In this programme, we’ll be finding out how pandemics end, and, as usual, we’ll be learning some related vocabulary as well."

So, Neil, my question this week is: which disease was eradicated in 1977? Was it:"

And one of the ways that they end socially is when everyone just sort of agrees that they have ended – when everyone is simply willing to tolerate more risk. On other words, we sort of declare victory, maybe prematurely, or another way of thinking about it is, we put our heads in the sand."
