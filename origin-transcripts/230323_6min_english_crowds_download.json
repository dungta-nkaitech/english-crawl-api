For some, crowds create feelings of excitement and a sense of community, while for others they feel uncomfortable, confusing, or even dangerous. So why is that?"

And, as usual, we’ll be learning some new vocabulary as well. But first, I have a question for you, Neil. The biggest crowd in history happened in 2019 when over 200 million people gathered in the northern Indian city of Allahabad. But what did so many people come together for? Was it:"

    "text": "OK, Neil. We’ll find out the answer later in the programme. People gathering for a cricket match, or a music concert are usually happy events. But crowds can have a darker side as well – they can become out of control and sometimes even violent. Here’s, psychologist, Professor John Drury, discussing this idea with, Anand Jagatia, presenter of the BBC World Service programme, appropriately named, CrowdScience."

And according to Dr Anne Templeton, another expert on crowd psychology from the University of Edinburgh, that’s especially true when you identify with the other people in a crowd. Here is Dr Templeton explaining more to BBC World Service programme, CrowdScience."

There's a correlation between having that social identification and feeling safer. So often if we feel like we are in a group with others, we expect them to look after us. The flip side of that is when you don't feel as much part of the group, and you're not having a positive experience."
