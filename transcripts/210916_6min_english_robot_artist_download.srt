00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,159
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

7
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,240
And I'm Sam. Do you think robots could ever become intelligence, Sam?

8
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,879
Well, if you believe Hollywood movies like Robocop, robots will grow more powerful than their

9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,240
human creators and take control. You've been watching too many sci-fi movies, Sam.

10
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,680
But seriously, do you think robots will ever be able to think or dream? Could they fall in love or

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,439
create art? It's hard to say, but because of the huge advances in artificial intelligence over

12
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,840
the last 10 years, questions like these are being asked more and more. In this programme, we'll be

13
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,320
meeting a very unusual person, if that's the right word, who could help answer some of these questions.

14
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:26,959
She's called Ada. She's an artist who can draw, paint and create sculptures, and she's a robot.

15
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:34,079
Yes, the humanoid robot Ada uses a robotic arm and a pencil to draw what it sees with a camera in

16
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,079
its eye. It's very lifelike and can even talk to the people whose picture it's drawing.

17
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,959
We'll hear more about this extraordinary robot and the team of inventors behind her soon.

18
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:51,679
First, I have a quiz question. The name Ada uses the abbreviation for artificial intelligence,

19
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:58,559
AI, to make a woman's first name. But which famous real-life Ada was the robot named after?

20
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:04,639
Was it Ada Brown, B, Ada Lovelace or C, Ada Marys?

21
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:07,919
I think it must be B, Ada Lovelace.

22
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:13,919
Okay, Sam, we'll find out if that's right later. Of course, building a realistic robot that can see,

23
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:19,199
hold a pencil and draw is not easy. Behind the creation of Ada was a team led by Cornish

24
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:26,799
Robotics Company, Engineered Art, and supported by engineers in Leeds who built her robotic arms

25
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:32,719
by using AI Systems, developed at Oxford University. Here's Chief Engineer Marcus Hold,

26
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:38,959
introducing presenter Carl Boss to the still unfinished Ada for the first time for BBC World Service

27
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,719
programme in the studio. It's very strange because on first glance she looks incredibly

28
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:50,800
scary, like a dystopian robot from the future, but when you see her move and express,

29
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:58,560
she becomes incredibly cute. People tend to refer to them as he or she, they're drawn to the robots.

30
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,719
So much of our communication is nonverbal. I'm gesturing with my arms, I'm smiling,

31
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:12,080
and our robots are a big part of their appeal and their human nature is in the way they behave

32
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,479
and move, and it's great that you're picking up on that from something that has no skin.

33
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:25,120
When Carl first meets Ada, he sees a wired up metal skull without skin. She looks like a robot

34
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,840
from a dystopia, an imaginary future world where everything is bad.

35
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,280
But as Carl spends more time with Ada, he begins to see her move and express herself.

36
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,599
She smiles, blinks and uses facial expressions and hand gestures, known as nonverbal communication

37
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:48,000
to appear more human. This human-like behaviour is part of Ada's appeal, the quality in someone

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,280
that makes them attractive or interesting. And soon, Carl is calling the robot, she instead of it.

39
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:01,680
Former Art Gallery owner, Aiden Mellor, manages the Ada project. Here he is speaking to the BBC

40
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,759
World Services in the studio about the complex process involved in building a working robot.

41
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,560
We've got the programmers and researchers working at Oxford University and Goldsmiths,

42
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,319
and they're doing the algorithmic programming, programming the AI that is going to be eventually used

43
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,959
for the art pieces that we're doing. But we've also got a couple of guys who are actually working

44
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:29,759
on her arm, the her ability to draw and actually getting her to do a compelling drawing of what she

45
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,919
sees. Some battles still to be won before the show. We will eventually hopefully iron all the

46
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,839
issues before that time. One challenge the teen faced was building a robotic arm that could allow

47
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:48,959
Ada to draw pictures that were compelling, exciting, interesting and able to keep your attention.

48
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,799
In combining an electronic AI brain with mechanical robot eyes and arms, there were many battles

49
00:04:54,799 --> 00:05:00,159
to be won, difficulties and technical obstacles to be overcome. And at the time of the interview,

50
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:07,039
the teen still had some issues to iron out removing problems by finding solutions. Before Ada's

51
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:13,279
opening show, an exhibition of her artwork at the Design Museum in London. Amazing, it's nice to

52
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,399
think that a robot could be the next Picasso instead of an outer control sci-fi policeman.

53
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,719
Yes, and the whole project was inspired by a real life woman. Whose name was?

54
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,679
What was the answer to your quiz question, Neil?

55
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:32,000
Ah yes, I asked Sam which famous Ada was the real life inspiration behind the robot Ada.

56
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,519
And I said, be Ada Lovelace, was I right?

57
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:41,359
You were right, Sam. Ada is named after Ada Lovelace, the 19th century English mathematician

58
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:43,759
and first computer programmer in the world.

59
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,599
Okay, Neil, let's recap the vocabulary from this programme, starting with dystopia, an imaginary

60
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:55,839
future society where everything is bad. Nonverbal communication is communication using physical

61
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,839
gestures and facial expressions instead of speech. The appeal of something is a quality it has which

62
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:07,599
people find attractive. If something is compelling, it holds your attention because you find it so

63
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,920
interesting. A battle to be won means a problem to be solved or an obstacle to overcome.

64
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,200
And finally, to iron something out means to remove or find solutions to a problem.

65
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:25,840
With artificial intelligence improving so fast, it may not be too long before we see robot

66
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,439
presenters of six minute English. But until Sam and I are replaced by AI, we hope you'll join us

67
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,480
again next time for more trending topics and useful vocabulary here at BBC Learning English.

68
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,759
Goodbye for now. Goodbye.
