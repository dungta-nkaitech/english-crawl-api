6-Mute English from BBCLearningEnglish.com

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Phil.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And I'm Georgie. For me, there's nothing like reading a book.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I love turning the pages and the smell of the paper.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But nowadays, the fact is that much of the time we read from electronic screens, not paper.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes, like Georgie, I love books.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I also find that too much screen time hurts my eyes.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But the availability of digital information means that I end up reading from screens most days.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So, apart from sore eyes, is this a problem?

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Is reading from screens harmless or could it be damaging us in some way, such as reducing our attention span?

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The length of time that someone can keep concentrated on what they are doing?

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's what we'll be discussing in this programme. And of course, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary too.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Great, but first, it's time for my question.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Whether you prefer paper or screens, as humans, we're now reading more words than ever before.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So, how many words does the average person read a day?

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Is it a 50,000 words, b 100,000 words, or c 200,000 words?

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I guess it's 50,000 words a day.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay, Georgie, we'll find out the correct answer later in the programme.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Of course, there's little doubt that any kind of reading is good for you.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Here's Cressida Cow, author of the How to Train Your Dragon Children's Books,

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
which is speaking with BBC Ideas.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Reading brings three magical powers, creativity, intelligence and empathy.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Reading for the joy of it is one of the two key factors in a kid's later economic success.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You're more likely to not be in prison, to vote, to own your own home.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
All of these advantages and benefits happen as a result of lip-seeing.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Cressida talks about the importance of reading for the joy of it.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
When you do an activity for the joy of it, you do it simply for the pleasure of doing it,

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
rather than as a way to gain something else.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Cressida lists the many benefits of reading for children, including economic success in later life,

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
but many of these benefits depend on a state known as deep reading,

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
analysing a text to understand its deeper meaning, and in test after test,

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
researchers have shown that deep reading skills develop better when kids read from books.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Professor Marianne Wolfe is a teacher and advocate for children's literacy around the world.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Here she explains more about deep reading to BBC Ideas.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
When we read at a surface level, we're just getting the information.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
When we read deeply, we use much more of our cerebral cortex.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Deep reading means that we make analogies, we make inferences, which allows us to be truly critical

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and a lidic, empathic human beings.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The reality is, it's not what or how much we read, but how we read that's really important.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The very volume is having negative effects because to absorb that much, there's a propensity towards skinny.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Professor Wolfe's research shows that reading from screens encourages reading at the surface level,

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
quickly and superficially looking at what can be easily understood.

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Reading books, on the other hand, activates different areas of the brain,

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
allowing a reader to develop positive traits like empathy,

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
and to understand the deeper level of a book, including analogies and inferences.

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
An analogy is a comparison between things that have similar features.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
For example, you might talk about the human heart using the analogy of a pump.

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
An inference is a guess, opinion or conclusion that you make based on the information you already have.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
For example, seeing smoke in the distance, you would make an inference that there's fire.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's these types of deeper, more subtle understanding that we get from reading books.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So why is it that reading from screens doesn't develop these skills in the same way?

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Well, the answer has to do with the volume.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The sheer number of words, pens and notifications that screens bombard us with every day.

54
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Instead of deep reading, this encourages skimming,

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
reading rapidly in order to get a general overview of something.

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I think it's time to reveal the answer to my question, Georgie.

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I asked you how many words does the average modern person read a day?

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And I guess it was 50,000 words.

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Well, you were half right.

60
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
In fact, the correct answer was double that.

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
100,000 words. Right.

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt from this programme,

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
starting with attention span, the length of time that someone can stay concentrated on one thing.

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
If you do something for the joy of it, you do it simply for the pleasure you get,

65
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
rather than as a way to get something else.

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The phrase on the surface level describes looking at something quickly and superficially,

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
rather than trying to understand its full, deeper meaning.

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
An analogy is a comparison between things that have similar features.

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
For example, a human heart and a pump.

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And an inference is a guess or conclusion that you make based on the information you already have,

71
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
like inferring fire from seeing smoke.

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And finally, skimming is reading rapidly in order to get a general overview of the text being read.

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Once again, our six minutes are up. Good bye for now.

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Bye.
