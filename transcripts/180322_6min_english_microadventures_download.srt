From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,280
Hello, I'm Rob and welcome to 6 Minute English.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,359
The show that brings you an interesting topic

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:20,160
and authentic listening practice.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,600
And don't forget vocabulary to help you improve your language skills.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,760
I'm Neil, by the way.

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,199
And today, we're off on an adventure.

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,400
Yes, but not a very big adventure, Neil,

12
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:31,919
it's just a mini or microadventure.

13
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:34,799
But if you have wanderlust, a strong desire to travel,

14
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:36,399
I think it may appeal.

15
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,039
It will appeal to you, Rob, because you love to travel.

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,399
Have a new circumnavigated globe.

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,839
I mean, gone all the way around the world.

18
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:46,640
Well, almost, Neil, but today's mini adventure

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,399
doesn't involve traveling too far from home.

20
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,439
We'll explore the topic more in a moment,

21
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:54,359
but not before we've set today's quiz question.

22
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,480
So, Neil, do you know how far it is around the world

23
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,879
measured at the equator?

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,040
In other words, the circumference.

25
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,560
Is it approximately a 30,000 kilometers,

26
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,840
be 40,000 kilometers or see 50,000 kilometers?

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,920
Well, I haven't walked it, but I know it's a long way,

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,040
so I'll go for see 50,000 kilometers.

29
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,840
Right. I shall keep you in suspense

30
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,320
and tell you the answer at the end of the programme.

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,320
Now, our topic for discussion today won't be travelling so far.

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,840
It's about a new trend for small adventures.

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,879
What you mean are shorter breaks, closer to home.

34
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,679
They're less expensive, of course,

35
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:32,479
but also instill a sense of adventure.

36
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,599
That's the feeling of doing a new, exciting,

37
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,879
and sometimes dangerous activity.

38
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:39,560
Well, adventurer Alistair Humphries has coined the phrase

39
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,159
microadventures to describe this.

40
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,679
To coin here means to use a word or phrase

41
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:46,199
that no one has used before.

42
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:48,959
Now, he's someone who goes on big trips and expeditions

43
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,719
to the four corners of the globe

44
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:53,159
and writes books about his adventures,

45
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,159
but he wanted to prove you don't have to go far to find adventure.

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,359
Let's hear from him now,

47
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:01,599
speaking on BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme

48
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,039
about what he did.

49
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,280
How do he describe his first microadventure?

50
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,240
I'd been doing big adventures for years,

51
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,039
and I had this hunch that you didn't need to go to the end

52
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,960
of the world to have some sort of adventure.

53
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,800
You didn't need to be in beautiful Patagonia

54
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,479
to have the spirit of adventure.

55
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:20,079
So I decided to try and prove my theory

56
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:23,159
by doing the most boring, ugly adventure I could think of,

57
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:27,560
and I came up with the idea of walking a lap of the M25

58
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,439
in the snow in January.

59
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,599
And time and again, as I walked around the M25,

60
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,400
I just kept thinking to myself,

61
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,759
this experience is exactly the same

62
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:39,680
as the four years I spent cycling around the world.

63
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,560
Smaller, of course, a bit silly,

64
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,639
but definitely felt like an adventure.

65
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,840
And that's when I really started to come up

66
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,000
with the idea of microadventures.

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,400
So a microadventure is a boring, ugly adventure,

68
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,240
no Neil.

69
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,159
It may not be glamorous, but it is an adventure.

70
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,560
He walked around the London Orbital Motorway,

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,480
called the M25, to prove his hunch

72
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,240
that you don't need to go far to find adventure.

73
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,640
A hunch is an idea you have based on feelings,

74
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,800
but there's no proof.

75
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,560
Well, his hunch was right,

76
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,040
but walking alongside a motorway isn't my idea of adventure.

77
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,319
No, it doesn't have to be Neil.

78
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,080
Just getting out on your bike and exploring somewhere

79
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,960
in your locality that you haven't visited before is an adventure.

80
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
What about camping?

81
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,560
I do like to camp out.

82
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,480
Now that's a phrasal verb to mean sleep outside in a tent.

83
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,760
You can be so close to nature and breathe in the fresh air.

84
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,439
Ah, yes.

85
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:35,719
And you don't need to go far for a camping adventure

86
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:39,159
and being out at night really adds to the sense of adventure.

87
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,920
That's what Alistair Humphries believes.

88
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,080
We humans are so boring these days,

89
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,280
we so rarely spend time out in the darkness

90
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,240
to see the stars and to see how the world feels different by night.

91
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,520
I get a little bit nervous still.

92
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,080
I still imagine ghosts, but that's part of the charm

93
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,080
of making the little frisson of adventure.

94
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,600
And then in the morning the sun comes up,

95
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,719
the birds sing, jump in a river,

96
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:04,439
back on the bus, back to your desk for nine o'clock.

97
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:07,520
Seeing how the world feels at night is a nice idea.

98
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,800
Getting a bit nervous, anxious maybe,

99
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,000
is part of the pleasure or enjoyment

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,760
what Alistair calls charm.

101
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,520
I agree.

102
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,680
And he used another word frisson,

103
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,079
meaning a sudden strong feeling of excitement or fear.

104
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,399
My biggest fear will be returning to my desk for nine o'clock.

105
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,560
But Alistair is right, there is an adventure

106
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,079
to be had on your doorstep.

107
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,759
That means close to where you live.

108
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,319
But only a small adventure Rob,

109
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,919
unlike an adventure around the circumference of the Earth.

110
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:34,919
Ah yes, that was my question earlier.

111
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:37,919
How far is it around the world measured at the equator?

112
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,039
In other words, the circumference.

113
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:43,319
Is it approximately a 30,000 kilometers,

114
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,439
B 40,000 kilometers or C 50,000 kilometers?

115
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,919
And I says C 50,000 kilometers.

116
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,800
Sorry Neil, too far.

117
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,600
The Earth's circumference has been calculated to be 40,000 and 75 kilometers.

118
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,600
To travel that distance would be a major adventure.

119
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,000
OK, I think we should remind ourselves of some of the words and phrases we've discussed today.

120
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,720
Starting with wanderlust, a strong desire to travel.

121
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,160
Rob has wanderlust.

122
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,639
He's never at home.

123
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,560
That's because I have a sense of adventure.

124
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,840
That's the feeling of doing a new, exciting,

125
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,800
and sometimes dangerous activity.

126
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,160
Neil has no sense of adventure because he likes his holidays to be planned out with no surprises.

127
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,920
That's a little unfair, Rob.

128
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,840
I just like to be holiday happy.

129
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,879
That's a term I've just coined,

130
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:33,639
which means use the word or phrase that no one has used before.

131
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:40,120
You can also say to coin a phrase after using an expression that is well known and possibly used too much.

132
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,639
Next we heard hunch.

133
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,199
That's an idea you have based on feelings, but there's no proof.

134
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,319
I have a hunch Neil wants to go to the pub.

135
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,480
He's packing his bag.

136
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,160
Your hunch is correct, Rob, but not before we recap our next word, charm.

137
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,240
That's part of the pleasure or enjoyment of something.

138
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,840
Part of the charm of going to the seaside is eating ice cream and walking down the pier.

139
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,080
And finally, we heard on your doorstep, which means close to where you live.

140
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,560
There's a pub right on your doorstep, so why don't you make the most of it?

141
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,040
I intend to, Rob, but first let me remind you that you can learn English with us at BBCLearningEnglish.com.

142
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,800
That's it for today's six minute English.

143
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,480
We hope you enjoyed it. Bye for now.

144
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
Bye-bye.
