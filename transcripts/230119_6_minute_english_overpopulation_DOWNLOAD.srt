6 Minute English from the BBC.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,399
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:17,280
And I'm Sam.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,480
We're talking about the environment in this program,

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,640
specifically climate change.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,719
Now, Sam, what do you think is the biggest cause of climate change?

9
00:00:26,799 --> 00:00:31,280
An obvious answer would be that climate change is the result of carbon emissions

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,200
caused by humans. It's about people's carbon footprint.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,239
The measurement of how much carbon dioxide is produced by someone's everyday activities.

12
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,719
That makes sense. But recently, some scientists, especially in the West,

13
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,200
have been focusing on another issue.

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,920
The increasing number of people in the world,

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,399
something known as overpopulation.

16
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,640
In this program, we'll be discussing the controversial link between overpopulation and climate change.

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,320
And as usual, we'll be learning some new vocabulary as well.

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,840
Sounds good, Neil. But first, I have a question for you.

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,840
Over the last 100 years, within one lifetime, the world's population has soared.

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,640
At the start of the 20th century, it was around one and a half billion.

21
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,920
But how many people are there in the world today?

22
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:26,159
Is it A, 7 billion, B, 8 billion, or C, 9 billion?

23
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,480
I'll say around 8 billion people live on the planet today.

24
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,840
Okay, Neil, I'll reveal the answer later in the program.

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,040
Since climate change is caused by human activities,

26
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,240
it seems common sense that fewer people would mean lower carbon emissions.

27
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,280
But in fact, the connection isn't so simple.

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,760
Not everyone emits carbon equally.

29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,840
People in the Western world produce far more than people in sub-Saharan Africa or Asia.

30
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,120
Avvind Ravikuma is professor of climate policy at the University of Texas.

31
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,600
He's made the surprising calculation that an extra 2 billion people,

32
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,200
born in low-consuming countries, would actually add very little to global carbon emissions.

33
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,680
Here, Kate Lambel and Neil Resell, presenters of BBC World Service Program,

34
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,000
the climate question, discuss Professor Ravikuma's findings.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,480
What he's saying is kind of astonishing, right?

36
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,760
2 billion people is, to say the least, a lot.

37
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,800
It's the combined population of Europe and Africa.

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,040
He's crunched the numbers and found that an extra 2 billion low-income people,

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,719
as defined by the World Bank, these are people without cars, without electricity often,

40
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,520
would see global emissions rise by just 1.5%.

41
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,960
Add 2 billion high-income earners, that's people with cars and power and all the modcons,

42
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,400
and Avvind reckons emissions would rise by more than 60%.

43
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,719
So when it comes to climate change and population, where you were born, matters.

44
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,879
Professor Ravikuma made his discovery after crunching the numbers,

45
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,719
an idiom meaning performing many mathematical calculations involving large amounts of data.

46
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:08,400
He concluded that whereas 2 billion low-income people would increase carbon levels very little,

47
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,480
2 billion high-income people would increase it a lot.

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:19,840
That's because high-income populations have modcons, which are short for modern conveniences,

49
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,000
technology and machines like cars, fridges and air conditioning that make life easier and more

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,640
pleasant. According to this view, the real problem is not overpopulation, but over consumption.

51
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,080
Affluence, that's having lots of money and owning many things, has become a big factor in

52
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,800
climate change, and that's true in poorer countries as well as richer ones.

53
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:49,040
Listen to Rajesh Joshi, reporter for BBC World Services, the climate question, interviewing a rich

54
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,520
Indian housewife, Priti Dagan, in her luxurious home in New Delhi.

55
00:03:53,520 --> 00:04:01,840
I need everything that I buy. You cannot be judgmental about anybody's needs, and I derive a lot

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,560
of happiness out of being very, very drawn towards consumer things, and I love it, and I am not

57
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:16,079
apologetic about it. So if I tell you that poor people have a smaller carbon footprint as compared

58
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,519
to their richer counterparts, do you feel apologetic about it? So the brain says, yes, we should be

59
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,840
apologetic about it, but the heart does not agree, yes. Poor can't afford lots of stuff, so the

60
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:34,479
carbon imprint is small, but here my heart wins over my brain because it gives me happiness.

61
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,239
Priti does not feel apologetic about her shopping. She doesn't think that she should feel sorry.

62
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:46,319
Shopping makes her happy, and she lets her heart rule her head, an idiom, meaning that you do

63
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:52,879
something based on emotions rather than reason. Priti is being very honest. She is consuming and looking

64
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,120
for happiness in a way that people in the West have been doing for decades.

65
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,040
It seems overconsumption is a bigger cause of climate change than raw population numbers.

66
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,120
Speaking of which, what was the answer to your question, Sam?

67
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,600
Ah yes, I asked about the current global population. You guessed it was around 8 billion people,

68
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,839
which was the correct answer. According to the United Nations, the world's population reached 8

69
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:26,879
billion on November 15th, 2022. Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned starting with

70
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:32,479
carbon footprint, a measurement of how much carbon dioxide someone's activities produce.

71
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:38,399
If you crunch numbers, you perform many mathematical calculations involving large amounts of data.

72
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:44,719
Mod cons is short for modern conveniences, machines like cars, washing machines, and fridges,

73
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,279
which make life easier and more pleasant.

74
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:51,199
Affluence means having lots of money or material possessions.

75
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,799
If you are apologetic, you show that you feel sorry for something harmful you have said or done.

76
00:05:56,799 --> 00:06:03,119
And finally, the idiom, let your heart rule your head, means to do something based on emotion

77
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:09,519
and personal desires rather than for logical or practical reasons. For now, it's goodbye.

78
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,239
Bye bye.
