5
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,040
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Sophie.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,240
And I'm Neil.

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,440
What are you reading?

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,400
A news blog.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,800
It says here that the fossil of a two-headed dinosaur has been discovered in Greece.

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,080
Look, look at this picture.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,879
Oh, honestly, Neil, you shouldn't believe everything you read on the internet.

12
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,159
This story is from one of those fake news websites that float about on social media.

13
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:36,879
And you aren't the only one to get taken in.

14
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:42,000
Even serious news channels report these types of stories as if they were true.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,479
Taking in means fooled by something.

16
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,159
Well, I must admit, I did believe it.

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,000
And I didn't know that fake or pretend news sites existed.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,399
How am I supposed to know what's fake and what's real?

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,480
So many extraordinary things happen.

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,319
That's a good question and actually, digital news and its effect on traditional newspapers

21
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:02,000
is the subject of today's show.

22
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,039
The thing is, if you read a traditional print newspaper like I do,

23
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:09,519
you'd find stories that are more reliable.

24
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,799
Once you can trust.

25
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,640
Well, enjoy your traditional print newspaper while you can, Sophie,

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,560
because they're going to disappear pretty soon.

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,159
The same way as the dinosaurs.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,159
It is true that print newspapers are feeling the pinch these days.

29
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,799
And that means not making enough money.

30
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,719
But I will miss them if they go.

31
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,359
Which brings me on to today's quiz question.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,760
Neil, how many national print newspapers are currently sold in the UK a day?

33
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,760
Is it A, 70,000?

34
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,080
B, 700,000?

35
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,159
Or C, 7 million?

36
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,400
Ooh, well, I'll go for A, 70,000.

37
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,640
It can't be much more than that, surely.

38
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,040
Well, we'll find out whether you got the answer right or not later in the show.

39
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,320
But moving on now, we've discussed one disadvantage of digital news

40
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,160
that it can be hard to distinguish a real story from a fake one,

41
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,120
given the massive information available on the web.

42
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,560
So, maybe you should tell us about the advantages, Neil.

43
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,960
Well, you can access news 24-7 and search for it on your phone or tablet

44
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,040
without having to flip through pages of stuff you aren't interested in.

45
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,640
It isn't all in black and white,

46
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,000
and it isn't all about reading you can watch and listen to.

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,919
And make comments of your own.

48
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,879
OK, well, let's listen to Tim Luckhurst,

49
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,439
professor of journalism at Kent University,

50
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,719
to see what he thinks is important in journalism nowadays.

51
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,680
It doesn't matter whether your local journalist produces news on a tablet,

52
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,120
on a mobile phone, in print, online, on television or on radio.

53
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,800
What matters is that there should be a diversity of journalism available

54
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,160
and that it should be provided by professional reporters,

55
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,240
whose job is to do an honest objective job impartially in the public interest,

56
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,960
not simply to rant or express opinions.

57
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,840
Tim Luckhurst there, he says that news will be successful on any platform,

58
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,760
digital or traditional.

59
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,560
So long as reporters are honest and objective in their pursuit of a good story.

60
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,400
If you're objective, it means you aren't influenced by personal feelings or opinions.

61
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,759
If you rant, you speak in an angry, opinionated way about something.

62
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,240
Now, newspapers need to make money in order to pay their journalists

63
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,640
and with circulation falling dramatically,

64
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,920
they need to find other ways to make newspapers pay.

65
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,480
A newspaper's circulation is the number of copies it distributes per day.

66
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,199
Well, selling more advertising spaces one way, isn't it?

67
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,280
Yes, but many advertisers are choosing to use digital platforms

68
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,479
because they reach a wider and more targeted audience.

69
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,519
And this is one reason why digital news is taking over.

70
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,919
It can pay for itself through advertising.

71
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,959
I wouldn't mind paying more for a newspaper if I knew the quality of the journalism is good.

72
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,199
But increasingly, people are expecting good quality journalism for free.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,919
Newspapers have been around since the invention of the printing press.

74
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,599
And as chronicles or written accounts of people's lives are an important historical resource.

75
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:26,560
Let's listen to Alex Cox, researcher at Genealogy website, findmypass.co.uk, talking more about this.

76
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,959
Join the First World War.

77
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,719
Local papers always printed in memoriam columns where they'd list local dead.

78
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:36,879
What a lot of them also did was they allowed relatives to submit short poems about that deceased

79
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,240
loved ones and some of them were five or six lives not very long, but they're really,

80
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,519
really quite powerful. And the paper dedicated page space to print not just one of these,

81
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,079
but multiple. And I don't know whether a modern paper would even consider doing that today.

82
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,800
Deceased is another word for dead.

83
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,279
In this case, it refers to the British soldiers who died in the First World War.

84
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,120
Local papers at the time printed poems written by the families of the dead men.

85
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,600
Those poems captured in print are an important historical record of the time.

86
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:17,120
Indeed. Now, remember Neil, I asked you how many national print newspapers are currently sold

87
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:25,519
in the UK a day? Is it A, 70,000, B, 700,000 or C, 7 million?

88
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,840
Yes, I remember and I said 70,000.

89
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:37,039
Well, I'm sorry, Neil, but you are wrong. The answer is actually C, 7 million, but the numbers

90
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:43,120
are falling. Well, that's still a few million more than I thought. Now, I think it must be time

91
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:55,679
to hear the words we learned today. They are taken in, fake, reliable, feeling the pinch, objective,

92
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:07,199
rant, circulation, chronicles, deceased. Well, that's the end of today's six minute English.

93
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,840
Please join us again soon. Goodbye. Goodbye.
