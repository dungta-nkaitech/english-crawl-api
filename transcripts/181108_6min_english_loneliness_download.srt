4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,120
Hello, welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,080
And I'm Sam.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,480
And we are sitting here in New Broadcasting House in the middle of London.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,280
Would you say, Sam, that this is an isolated place?

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,679
Oh, no. Not at all.

9
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,600
Isolated means far away from other places and people.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,719
Does that mean then do you think that you can't be lonely here

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,359
with all these people around and all these things to do?

12
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:36,800
Ah, good question.

13
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,760
Can you be lonely in a crowd?

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,120
Yes, of course.

15
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,520
I think you can be because being lonely isn't about physical isolation.

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,840
I think you can be lonely anywhere if you feel that you're disconnected from the world around you,

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,400
if you feel that no one understands you.

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,560
If you are living happily in isolation in the Scottish Highlands, for example,

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,920
I'm sure you could feel only if you came here to London.

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,359
Well, loneliness is today's topic.

21
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,320
The BBC has just completed a big survey about it,

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,799
which we will learn more about shortly.

23
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,640
But first, of course, a question,

24
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,520
where is the most isolated inhabited place on the planet,

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,879
by which I mean the place furthest away from anywhere else,

26
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,680
with the fewest people living there?

27
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,560
Is it a MacMurdo station in Antarctica?

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,200
B, Seawa Oasis in Egypt's western desert?

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,600
Or is it C, the island of Tristan, D'Akunya in the South Atlantic?

30
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,560
What do you think, Sam?

31
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,799
I've got absolutely no idea.

32
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,320
So this is just a guess.

33
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,280
I think it's the one in Antarctica.

34
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,400
I'm going to go with that.

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,520
Well, we'll have the answer later on in the programme.

36
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,560
Loneliness is seen as a big problem for the mental health of the population,

37
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,840
so much so that the British government has a minister for loneliness.

38
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,439
But which age group suffers most from loneliness?

39
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,200
Here is a BBC report about the research.

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,120
There is a common stereotype that loneliness affects only the old and the isolated.

41
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,800
It does, but what this experiment also shows is that loneliness is felt throughout life.

42
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,680
People age between 16 and 24 experience loneliness more often and more intensely than any other age group.

43
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,800
So according to the research, Sam, which section of society is most affected by loneliness?

44
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,680
Hmm, this might be a surprise, but it's 16 to 24-year-olds.

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,800
I was surprised by that because like many, I would have guessed that it was older people.

46
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Hmm, the reporter did say that that was a stereotype.

47
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,719
A stereotype is nothing to do with stereo music,

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,039
but it's the noun we use to describe a very simple and basic judgment of someone and their

49
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:59,360
character and personality based on their age, nationality, profession and so on.

50
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:07,759
So a stereotype of British people is that we can't cook, we have bad teeth, we're very reserved

51
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,280
and never say what we mean.

52
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,159
Ah, I don't know what you mean, my cooking is wonderful, Sam.

53
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,799
And the stereotype is that old people get lonely.

54
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,759
Much like the stereotypes of British people, this may be true in some cases.

55
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,039
I've eaten some of your home-cooked meals, remember Neil?

56
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,759
But it's not true for the majority.

57
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,719
It is young people who feel lonely more often and more intensely.

58
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:35,439
Intensely here means strongly.

59
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:40,560
The feeling of loneliness is stronger in young people than older people.

60
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:46,719
The reporter goes on to give some explanation for why young people might be more lonely.

61
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,280
Researchers from the University of Manchester who analysed the data suggested feeling lonely

62
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,800
may play the young because it's a time of identity change, figuring out your place in the world

63
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,719
and of learning to regulate emotions.

64
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,599
He says that feeling lonely may play young people.

65
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,800
What does he mean there?

66
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,319
Hmm, if you're plagued by something,

67
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,159
it means that it troubles you.

68
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,439
It bothers you and not just once.

69
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,439
It's something that happens continually or repeatedly.

70
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,079
And he says this maybe because at that age, we're still figuring out our place in the world.

71
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,920
We're trying to understand the world and what we're supposed to do with our lives.

72
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,519
He also suggests that younger people have not yet learned how to regulate their emotions,

73
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,680
which is another way of saying to control their emotions.

74
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,040
Right, time to review this week's vocabulary.

75
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,480
But before that, let's have the answer to the quiz.

76
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,120
I asked where is the most isolated inhabited place on the planet?

77
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,639
Is it A, McMurdo station in Antarctica?

78
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,879
B, Sea What Oasis in Egypt's western desert?

79
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,240
Or C, the island of Tristan, D'Aquiniar in the South Atlantic?

80
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,759
What did you say Sam?

81
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,480
I said A.

82
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,199
Well, I'm afraid to say the answer is actually C,

83
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,560
the island of Tristan, D'Aquiniar in the South Atlantic.

84
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,839
It has a population of fewer than 300 and it's only accessible by a six-day voyage by ship from South Africa.

85
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,199
So, uh, not so popular place for a weekend break?

86
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,879
Indeed not.

87
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,000
Now it's time for a recap of our vocabulary.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,919
The first word was isolated, which Tristan, D'Aquiniar certainly is.

89
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,879
It means far away from other places and people.

90
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:38,240
Then there was stereotype, the noun for a simplistic view of a person or group

91
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,759
based on their nationality, aid, profession and the like.

92
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,839
Intensely means strongly.

93
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,560
Being plagued by something means it causes you problems and difficulties.

94
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,959
If you are trying to figure something out, you are trying to understand it.

95
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,079
And to regulate something means to control it.

96
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,639
Well, sadly that's the end of the program.

97
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,040
Hopefully you won't feel too lonely without us.

98
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,879
Remember, we're always here on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube,

101
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,680
Bye.
