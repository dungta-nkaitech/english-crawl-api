00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,280
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Phil.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,679
And I'm Georgie. For most parents, their baby's first word is a special moment.

4
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,920
This happens after an early stage of language development called Babel,

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,000
when babies start making simple sounds like Gah or Ma.

6
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,800
Babies have to learn to use their mouth muscles to make specific sounds.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,320
They experiment with different sounds and mouth shapes.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,359
So what exactly is happening when babies start learning to speak?

9
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:40,719
What do you think Georgie?

10
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,879
Well, Phil, I'm no expert, but I imagine they watch the adults around them

11
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,560
and kind of copy and imitate what they do. What do you think?

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,799
I definitely think that's what my children did when they were learning to speak.

13
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,679
Well, let's compare our ideas with those of an expert.

14
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:03,920
Professor Julian Pine from Liverpool University, speaking here on BBC Radio 4,

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,000
and he lists the skills that babies develop in order to speak.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,759
Well, one of the first things the child's got to do is they've got to break down the

17
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,400
speech stream into words. Then they've got to link the words to the things that they refer to

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,200
in the environment, so they've got to learn what the words mean.

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,079
Right.

20
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,599
In this programme, we'll discover how babies learn to speak,

21
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:27,120
and as usual, we'll learn some useful new vocabulary.

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,400
And on the subject of words, remember, you can find a list of this programme's vocabulary

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,759
on our website, bbclearningenglish.com.

24
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,039
Some people find it helpful to study the vocabulary before listening.

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,200
And another thing to do before listening is ask my question.

26
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,439
Georgie, we've mentioned the babbling noises that babies make when learning to speak,

27
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,679
but what age does this usually start? Is it a, around six months old?

28
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,920
b, around nine months old, or c, around one year old?

29
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,400
Okay, I think my best guess would be a, around six months old.

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,240
Okay, well, we'll find out a little bit later on in the programme.

31
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,680
Let's return to Professor Pine's list.

32
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,599
The first thing babies do is recognise where individual words start and end.

33
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,520
For this, it helps to know that, in English, at least, words often begin with a stressed syllable.

34
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,879
The sound in a word which is emphasised by being spoken longer or louder.

35
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,400
Learning this takes time, and here, Professor Pine and Michael Rosen,

36
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,640
presenter of BBC Radio Falls programme, Word of Mouth,

37
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,000
discussed children who haven't quite discovered it yet.

38
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,240
And we can see this in the kind of errors that children make, because little kids will often call

39
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:58,000
the giraffe a raff, leaving off the unstressed syllable, because that's not typical English.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,719
Oh, and I've got an example of this. My son used to call a machine a sminge.

41
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,599
He just hit the stress. He didn't bother with the muck bit.

42
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,960
Yeah, exactly.

43
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,680
Well, you may have thought it was my sminge, of course, to say something.

44
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,520
Yes. And the classic example, of course, is Nana instead of banana.

45
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,200
Yes. I think I call them that.

46
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,280
One error or mistake infants make is calling a giraffe a raff, because they cut off the first

47
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,840
syllable, G, because it's not stressed. The classic example of this is when children say,

48
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,800
Nana instead of banana, a classic example of something means the best example of it.

49
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,200
One containing all the features you expect such a thing to have.

50
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,400
For example, ants are a classic example of animals working together.

51
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,000
The second skill babies develop as they learn to speak is correctly linking a word to the object

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,760
it refers to. In other words, knowing what the word means. As adults, we do this without thinking,

53
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,000
but it's actually much harder than it sounds, as Professor Julian Pine explains to BBC Radio 4

54
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,280
programme, Word of mouth. Well, we take for granted the fact that it's kind of obvious what

55
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,159
words refer to in the environment, but actually if you look at it from the child's point of view,

56
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,720
it's really difficult to work out what a word refers to, because there's so many things it could

57
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,480
refer to. So, you know, the speech signal is very ambiguous. How does the child know that you're

58
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,759
talking about the cup in front of you or the pen in front of you when you say fan or cup?

59
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:36,399
As adults, we take it for granted that when a friend says apple, they mean that round red thing

60
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:42,159
on the table. To take it for granted means to assume something without question.

61
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:50,560
But for a baby, the link between the word apple and the object is not obvious, it's ambiguous,

62
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,319
meaning it has more than one possible meaning. Wow, who knew so much was going on inside

63
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:02,800
baby's sponge-like brains as they soak up the sounds they hear? Right, Phil, isn't it time to reveal

64
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,279
the answer to your question? It is indeed. The question was at what age do babies start to make

65
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:15,759
babbling noises? And I said it was around six months. And that is the correct answer. Yay!

66
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:22,480
Baby, start to do this when they're about six months old. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary that

67
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:29,280
we've learnt starting with babble, the meaningless noises babies make as they're learning to speak.

68
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,200
The stress syllable in a word is the sound which is emphasised by being longer, louder or higher.

69
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,360
An error is a mistake. The classic example of something is the most typical example of it,

70
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,160
containing its most important features. If you take something for granted, you accept or assume it

71
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:55,200
without question. And finally, the adjective ambiguous means having more than one possible meaning.

72
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,080
Once again, our six minutes are up, but if you're ready for more, you'll find the worksheet with a

73
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,440
quiz and a transcript for this programme on our website. See you there soon. Bye!
