00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,320
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

7
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:51,680
If you live in a city, you're probably familiar with this very modern site. A man walking

8
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:57,439
his dog drops a little black plastic bag into a rubbish bin. Inside the bag is dog poo.

9
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,359
It might make it seem that humans are hygienic creatures, certainly cleaner than dogs who go to the

10
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,640
toilet wherever they want, but is this the whole story? How do us humans compare with other animals

11
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,000
when it comes to keeping ourselves and our environment clean? In this programme we'll be asking whether

12
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:23,280
humans as a species are naturally clean and tidy. In fact, from dumping raw sewage into rivers,

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,239
to littering the streets with trash, humans aren't always good at dealing with waste.

14
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:35,280
While some animals on the other hand are instinctively clean. Right, cats, for example, dig a hole

15
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,120
to bury their poo. In the past, humans got rid of their waste by throwing it into the street or

16
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,280
into streams and rivers, hoping the water would wash it away. House of sight, house of mind,

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,000
that's a phrase used to say that it's easier to forget something when you can't see it.

18
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,800
But this doesn't always work as we'll discover from my quiz question, Sam.

19
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,640
In Victorian times, the population of London boomed and so did all the pee and poo being thrown

20
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,200
into the river Thames. It got so bad that by the 1850s, the awful smell had its own name,

21
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:16,399
but what? Was it A, the great stench, B, the great stink, or C, the great smell?

22
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:22,799
All sounds pretty disgusting, Neil, but I'll go for A, the great stench.

23
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:29,519
Okay, Sam, we'll find out if that's right later. Earlier you mentioned cats as examples of

24
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:35,839
animals who hide their waste, but leafcutter ants go even further. They kill any dirty ants trying

25
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,000
to re-enter the group. Zoologist Professor Adam Hart has spent years studying ants and other

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,120
clean creatures here, here speaking with the BBC World Service Programme, the conversation.

27
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,719
Sam and I will be watching and it's just pouring out the back end and they don't seem to care.

28
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:58,000
Other animals will go to quite great lengths to go to a specific area. Some Antelope, for example,

29
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,120
will go to a sort of latrine area. It's really linked to their ecology, so quite often

30
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,039
animals are using dung and also urine as marking posts and territorial markers to say to other

31
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,480
groups of animals and other individuals that, well, this is my territory not yours.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Like cats and ants, antelopes go to great lengths, meaning they try very hard to do something.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,280
In this case, to leave their poo or dung in a specific area away from their home.

34
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,800
Antelopes leave smells called territorial markers, secreted in urine or pee

35
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,719
to tell other animals that an area of land is already occupied.

36
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,760
Okay, Sam, but just because most of us don't pee at the bottom of the garden,

37
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,240
does that necessarily mean humans are dirtier?

38
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,640
Well, no, not according to psychologist Dr Michael Debarra. He thinks that human

39
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,760
attitudes to cleanliness are related to the problem of infectious diseases,

40
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,120
something we've all experienced during the COVID pandemic.

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,400
Here is Dr Debarra explaining more to BBC World Services the conversation.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,759
So in humans, it seems like the emotion discussed as a big part of how we deal with infectious

43
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:17,519
disease problems. It's characterized by avoidance, by sometimes kind of feelings of nausea.

44
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,280
And what's interesting about it is that it is elicited by many of the things that are infectious

45
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,759
disease threats in our environment. So that might be particular smells or particular

46
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,039
substances, bodywaste, physical signs of infectious disease, coughs, sneezes.

47
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:40,639
Our natural reaction to something which is dursy and which therefore may be diseased and harmful

48
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:48,159
to us is disgust, a strong feeling of dislike or repulsion. We might feel so disgusted at the

49
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:53,599
sight or smell of human waste that we actually want to vomit, feeling known as nausea.

50
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:00,800
These bodily reactions are the immune systems way of saying, keep away, this will make you sick.

51
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,200
So although getting a bit dirty won't kill you unless you're a leafcutter and human evolution

52
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,160
has developed a psychological way of keeping us clean. What's the matter Sam, you look a little

53
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:19,920
dream. I am Neil, all this talk of being boo is disgusting. And just imagine how bad it must

54
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,120
have been in the old days. Like in Victorian times before the invention of modern sewers and

55
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,840
sanitation. In my quiz question I asked you what people called the awful smell in London in the 1850s.

56
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,520
And I said it was a, the great stench, was I right? You were wrong. In fact the answer was be the

57
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,360
great stink which stunk up the river tens all the way to Westminster. It was only when the smell

58
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,120
reached the noses of politicians in Parliament that something was done about it.

59
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:57,600
So starting another useful phrase to raise a stink about something, meaning to make a strong

60
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,160
public complaint. Okay let's recap the other vocabulary, starting with out of sight, out of mind,

61
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,400
a phrase meaning that it's easier to forget something when you can't see it. To go to great lengths

62
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:17,759
to try very hard to achieve something. Territorial markers are smells in animals dung or urine marking

63
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,599
their territory. These may fill you with disgust, a feeling of strong dislike or repulsion,

64
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:28,959
or even give you nausea the feeling that you're going to vomit. And that's all for this stinky
