2
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,960
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,280
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,960
Lots of things can make us feel embarrassed.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,160
That self-conscious, uncomfortable feeling when your face blushes red

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,080
and you wish you could just disappear.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,960
Have you had any embarrassing moments, Neil?

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,240
Yes, many.

9
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:32,000
Once I met my parents in a car park and I saw them arriving in their car

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,119
and I waved my hands around in a very silly way,

11
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,479
but unfortunately I soon discovered that it wasn't my parents.

12
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:40,960
It was another couple.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,359
Oh no. That's really embarrassing.

14
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,480
I remember answering the phone.

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,679
I thought it was my best friend and I said,

16
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,280
hello in a very silly voice.

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,920
And then they asked to speak to my dad and it wasn't my friend.

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,000
What was the voice?

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,359
Hello.

20
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,320
Oh dear. But embarrassment is more than just shyness and blushing.

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,400
When it comes to our health, there's no end of things to be embarrassed about.

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,439
Yes, and some people feel so embarrassed

23
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:11,039
that they don't go to see a doctor when they should.

24
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:14,039
Sometimes with serious consequences.

25
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:17,840
In this programme, we'll be discussing the issue of medical embarrassment.

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,280
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new words and phrases.

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,159
So I have a question.

28
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,560
Neil, according to the UK's Nursing Times newspaper,

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,680
what percentage of people surveyed

30
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,799
said they had delayed visiting their doctor out of embarrassment

31
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,359
and then later been diagnosed with a health condition.

32
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:41,120
Was it A21%?

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,319
B41% or C61%?

34
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,599
So I think it's probably a lot.

35
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,560
So C61%.

36
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,359
OK, we will find out if that's correct at the end of the programme.

37
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,400
As humans, we get embarrassed if we feel different from others,

38
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,159
especially if the difference is physical.

39
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,680
But how does feeling embarrassed about a medical condition

40
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,719
impact our relationship with the doctor?

41
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:13,560
Here's Dr Vanessa Appear, consultant in sexual health at Bart's Hospital in London,

42
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,840
explaining more to BBC Radio 4 programme Inside Health.

43
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,120
So they'll delay accessing the clinic and also seeking treatment.

44
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,840
And so then you'll often see people that could have been diagnosed

45
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,080
with what's happening much earlier and could have had earlier intervention,

46
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,879
but it's delayed quite significantly.

47
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,800
And so I then feel that we see a lot of people kind of suffering in silence, really.

48
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,439
Many people delay going to the doctor.

49
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,920
They postpone going or put it off until a later time.

50
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,520
As a result, their problem isn't diagnosed.

51
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,080
To diagnose means to identify a disease or health problem through medical examination.

52
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,400
For some, feelings of embarrassment are so strong,

53
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,840
they prefer to suffer in silence, to struggle with pain without seeking help,

54
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,879
rather than visit the doctor.

55
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,040
But fortunately, there are things you can do to help,

56
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,000
writing your problem down, going with a friend,

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and visiting a doctor you trust are some ideas Dr Appear recommends.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,319
There are ways that doctors can help as well.

59
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:21,280
As Dr Vanessa Appear explains here to James Gallagher,

60
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,840
presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme Inside Health.

61
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,879
Can you tell us what techniques you use to put people at ease?

62
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:34,039
I bring transparency to the conversation and own it and say that

63
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:37,120
I'm going to be asking you some quite personal questions,

64
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,920
and there may be also intimate examination.

65
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,080
I want to assure you that this is confidential,

66
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,400
that this is a safe non-judgmental space.

67
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:52,040
So really, I often name the words to create that space as well.

68
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,680
Also in my manner, I would hope, and in my non-verbal cues.

69
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,800
James asks what doctors can do to put people at ease,

70
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,360
to make them feel calm and relaxed,

71
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,120
and Dr Appear describes her ideal conversation.

72
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,160
It's a safe space, it's non-judgmental,

73
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,760
and what is said is confidential.

74
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:15,560
Capt. private and not shared with anyone.

75
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,240
As well as discussing embarrassing problems sensitively,

76
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,599
Dr Appear also uses non-verbal cues,

77
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:25,639
the expression on her face, her hand movements,

78
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:28,159
and the tone of her voice, rather than words,

79
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:31,199
to communicate and relax the patient.

80
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,639
Embarrassment is normal, and with support,

81
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:38,039
hopefully more of us will feel safe to visit the doctor, despite it.

82
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:41,240
Okay, Beth, isn't it time to reveal the answer to your question?

83
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,079
It is.

84
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,040
I asked you what percentage of people said they had delayed

85
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,040
visiting the doctor because they were embarrassed,

86
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,879
but then had later been diagnosed with a health condition.

87
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,240
Do you remember what you said, Neil?

88
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,240
Yes, I think I said C61%.

89
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,519
I'm afraid that is not the correct answer.

90
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,360
It was, in fact, A21% or just over a fifth.

91
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,720
Okay, let's recap the new vocabulary we've used,

92
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,720
starting with delay to postpone or put off until a later time.

93
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,280
To diagnose a disease or medical condition

94
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,200
means to identify it by recognising the symptoms

95
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,040
and examining the patient.

96
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,640
If you suffer in silence, you endure and struggle

97
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,520
with painful feelings without asking someone for help.

98
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,680
The phrasal verb puts someone at ease

99
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,840
means to make someone feel calm and relaxed.

100
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,760
The adjective confidential means kept private and secret

101
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:40,599
and describes information which is not shared with anyone else.

102
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:44,319
And finally, non-verbal cues are types of communication

103
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,279
using facial expressions, hand gestures or tone of voice

104
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:51,519
rather than speech to show your feelings.

105
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,319
Once again, our six minutes are up,

106
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,039
but why not build your vocabulary and listening skills even more

107
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,079
with the quiz and worksheet related to this programme?

108
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,399
They're both available now on our website,

109
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:04,719

110
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:05,879
See you there.

111
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,879
Bye.
