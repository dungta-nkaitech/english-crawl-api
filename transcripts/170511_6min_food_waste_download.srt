5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,800
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English,

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,560
the show that brings you an interesting topic,

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,839
authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary.

8
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:19,440
I'm Dan and I'm Neil.

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,400
In this episode, we'll be discussing food waste.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,160
Just as soon as...

11
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:25,199
Oh.

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,199
Neil, did you just throw the rest of that apple away?

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,079
Yeah.

14
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,880
Well, it was quite a big one and I couldn't finish it.

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,920
Neil, you know you shouldn't waste food.

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,760
Waste, meaning to throw away without consuming or using.

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,200
Ah, it's only an apple.

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,120
It's not the end of the world, Dan.

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,359
Well, that's what you could be wrong, my friend.

20
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:49,600
Let me prove it to you with this week's question.

21
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,760
How much of the world's food is wasted each year?

22
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,719
A, a half, B, a third or C, a quarter.

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,199
Hmm, I'm not sure. I know it's a lot,

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,599
so I'm going to say A, a half.

25
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:06,879
We'll find out if you're right or not at the end of this show.

26
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,879
So the actual figure is 1.3 billion tons of food,

27
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,599
which is enough to feed a billion hungry people.

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,719
Where do you think all this food waste comes from?

29
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:18,719
Well, restaurants, I imagine.

30
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,000
I mean, they can't give one customer's leftovers to another.

31
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,920
That would be unhygienic.

32
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,959
Leftovers are the remains of food, which has not been eaten.

33
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,200
And while you're right, restaurants are not the main contributors of food waste.

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,319
Supermarkets.

35
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,640
I bet they throw out loads of food once it goes past it's sell by date,

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,920
or the date which it can be legally sold by.

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,599
Think closer to home.

38
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,960
It's us, isn't it?

39
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,920
Yes.

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,039
In Europe, an incredible 53% of food waste comes from households,

41
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,360
which results in 88 million tons of food waste a year.

42
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,600
And I bet you can't guess what we do with it.

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,480
I want to say recycle, but I can see from your face, Dan, that it's not.

44
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,200
No.

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,240
Unfortunately, it goes into landfills and decays.

46
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,440
A landfill is a place where rubbish is buried.

47
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,159
I see, so the food rots, and this causes greenhouse gases,

48
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,120
which lead to global warming and climate change.

49
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,840
Exactly.

50
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,200
And the end of the world.

51
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,719
But remarkably, the European country of Denmark has managed to reduce its food waste

52
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,119
by a very significant 25%.

53
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:26,239
That's impressive.

54
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,359
How did that happen?

55
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:30,000
They attribute it to a woman called Selena Yule.

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,919
Hmm, I think I've heard about her.

57
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,039
She became a household name in Denmark overnight.

58
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,639
A household name is one which everybody knows, and that's right.

59
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,839
I thought she was Russian.

60
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:42,079
She is, but I'll let her explain.

61
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,359
I come from a country where there were food shortages,

62
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,600
back there in Moscow, communism collapsed.

63
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,520
We had the collapse of infrastructure.

64
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,720
We were not sure that we could get food on the table.

65
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,800
And coming to Denmark, seeing this abundance, seeing this supermarkets filled with food.

66
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,760
But then I was really shocked to see a lot of food getting wasted.

67
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,240
So Selena grew up in Moscow at a time when there wasn't enough food

68
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,480
because of the collapse of infrastructure,

69
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,840
meaning the basic systems and services of a society,

70
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,840
such as food transportation.

71
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,039
Then when she moved to Denmark, she found an abundance

72
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,360
or more than enough food.

73
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,680
But she saw it being wasted.

74
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,920
So she decided to do something about it?

75
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,640
Yep.

76
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,520
She started a Facebook page in 2008 called Stop Wasting Food.

77
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,560
And nine years later, the Danish government credits her

78
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,400
for their reduction in food waste.

79
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,920
How did she do it?

80
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,319
Well, lots of ideas really.

81
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,520
She convinced some supermarkets to stop selling their items in bulk

82
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,159
so that people would buy only what they need.

83
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,240
She's produced a leftovers cookbook

84
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,400
and she's working with three governments

85
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,960
to set up an education program in schools.

86
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,960
Wow, she's a busy woman.

87
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,360
So how about you educate me with the answer to this week's question?

88
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,240
Sure.

89
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,320
I asked you how much of the world's food is wasted each year?

90
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,320
Is it A, a half, B, a third, or C a quarter?

91
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,320
And I said A, a half.

92
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,160
And I'm terribly sorry mate, but you're wrong.

93
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,400
The answer is B, a third.

94
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,360
Ah, well it's not as bad as I thought it was at least.

95
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,120
Shall we have a look at the vocabulary then?

96
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes, let's.

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,600
First we had waste.

98
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,560
If you waste something, you throw it away or lose it

99
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,120
without using it or consuming it.

100
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,600
Common things, we waste our food, time, money, and energy.

101
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,319
We also have some expressions with waste too.

102
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,319
Can you think of one, Dan?

103
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,560
Oh, a waste of space is an expression

104
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,519
which means a thing is completely without value.

105
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,120
For example, I am a complete waste of space in the kitchen.

106
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,639
I can't cook at all.

107
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,439
Next we had leftovers.

108
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,839
Leftovers are the remains of food or a meal which have not been eaten.

109
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,919
What do you tend to do with your leftovers, Neil?

110
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,279
Oh, I love leftovers.

111
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,399
Sometimes I think they taste even better than the original meal.

112
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,079
I agree. Peet is a great example.

113
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,719
Then we had landfill.

114
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:08,079
A landfill is a place where rubbish is dropped and buried.

115
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,719
In colloquial English we might say a dump.

116
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,120
Do you ever take your rubbish to the dump, Dan?

117
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,480
Not if I can help it.

118
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,720
I prefer to recycle as much as possible.

119
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,560
I only go to the dump if I have to get rid of a larger plant, such as a fridge.

120
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,680
Then we had a household name.

121
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,880
To be a household name is to be well known by ordinary people

122
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,040
of a particular place or culture.

123
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,840
Can you think of a person who is a household name at the moment, Neil?

124
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,120
Oh, that's very easy.

125
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,720
Donald Trump springs to mind.

126
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,400
Everyone must know who he is.

127
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,480
Then we had infrastructure.

128
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,960
Infrastructure is the basic systems and services of a society,

129
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,720
such as electricity supply,

130
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,080
trains and roads.

131
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,680
And finally we had abundance.

132
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,280
If you have an abundance of something, you have more than you need.

133
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,040
Do you have anything in abundance, Neil?

134
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,960
Well, when it comes to my children,

135
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,280
I have to have an abundance of patience.

136
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,200
Well, most of the time.

137
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,879
And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

138
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,240
Please join us again soon.

139
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,759
And we're on social media too,

140
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,000
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.

141
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,800
See you there.

142
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,279
Goodbye.

143
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,079
Bye-bye.
