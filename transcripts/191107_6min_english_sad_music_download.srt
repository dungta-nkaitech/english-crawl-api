00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,800
Hello, this is 6 Minute English, I'm Sam.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,000
And I'm Neil.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,160
Do you like sad music, Neil?

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,199
Well, when I was younger, if I had a breakup with a girlfriend,

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,039
I would listen to sad songs.

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,960
Songs which reflected my mood.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,240
Hmm, and do you still listen to those songs now?

11
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,639
Not so much, but I do still like them.

12
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:36,320
Well, it seems as if there might be a biological reason why some of us do like sad songs.

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,239
We'll look at this topic a little more after this week's quiz question,

14
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,079
which is about music videos.

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,200
The music video has been around for a while,

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,399
but in what year was MTV, the first dedicated music video channel,

17
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:52,079
launched in the US?

18
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,959
Was it A, 1981?

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,160
B, 1982 or C, 1983?

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,719
Oh, well.

21
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,320
What do you think, Neil?

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,359
Going to have a guess.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,200
Is it the early 80s?

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,760
Hmm, well, yes.

25
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,000
Care to be more specific?

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,760
Well, well, it was a long time ago, I was just a small boy.

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,799
I'm going to go for 1982.

28
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,680
Okay, I will have the answer later in the programme,

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,319
but first, more about sad songs.

30
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:28,399
Professor David Huron from Ohio State University has conducted research in this area,

31
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:33,679
and he discussed it recently on the BBC World Service Radio programme, the Y Factor.

32
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:40,079
He was looking at why some people like sad music and other people really don't like it at all,

33
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,639
as he says they just can't stand it.

34
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,280
He believes it's to do with a hormone.

35
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,560
A hormone is a natural chemical in our bodies,

36
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,320
which can have an effect on various systems and also emotions.

37
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,519
Listen out for the name of the hormone he mentions.

38
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,480
One of the things that we were interested in is what's the difference between people who listen

39
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:06,240
to sad music and who love it, and people who listen to sad music and who just can't stand it?

40
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,080
In our research, it started pointing towards a hormone called prolactin.

41
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,960
Now, prolactin, as you might guess from the name, is associated with lactation,

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,159
breastfeeding, when people cry, they also release prolactin.

43
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,040
And there are circumstances in which prolactin seems to have this comforting effect.

44
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,879
So, which hormone did he mention?

45
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,159
He talked about the hormone called prolactin, which he said was connected to lactation.

46
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,680
This is the production of milk by mammals to feed their young.

47
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,680
What he noted was, this hormone can be released when people cry, and in some cases,

48
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,760
this hormone has a comforting effect. When something is comforting, it makes you feel better.

49
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,719
It calms your emotions. Let's listen again.

50
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,200
One of the things that we were interested in is what's the difference between people who

51
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,120
listen to sad music and who love it, and people who listen to sad music and who just can't stand it?

52
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,120
In our research, it started pointing towards a hormone called prolactin.

53
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,920
Now, prolactin, as you might guess from the name, is associated with lactation,

54
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:17,119
for breastfeeding, when people cry, they also release prolactin.

55
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:22,000
And there are circumstances in which prolactin seems to have this comforting effect.

56
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,759
So, what conclusions did he make about this hormone and how it might be working?

57
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,839
Professor Huron explains.

58
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:36,560
So, the thought was that perhaps what's going on is that the people who are enjoying listening to sad music

59
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:42,000
are receiving some sort of excess of prolactin, and people who are listening to sad music,

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,159
and they just find it incredibly sad and unhelpful, and they don't want to listen to it.

61
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,599
Maybe they're not getting enough prolactin when they listen to the music.

62
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,439
So, what's happening? Or as Professor Huron said, what's going on?

63
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,680
Well, it seems quite simple, though. I'm sure it's very complicated.

64
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,280
People who like sad music are maybe getting too much prolactin, or more than is normal.

65
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,280
He describes this as an excess of prolactin, and maybe people who don't like sad music aren't

66
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,680
getting enough. So, the idea is that prolactin is a hormone which we find comforting.

67
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,319
If our body's released it when we hear sad music, it gives us a good feeling.

68
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:28,399
But if prolactin isn't released, or there isn't enough of it, we just find the sad music sad,

69
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:30,399
and it doesn't help to tear us up.

70
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,959
I guess so, but you know, emotions are funny things.

71
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:38,399
It's weird to think that our feelings are caused by different natural chemicals that run around the body.

72
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,439
Absolutely.

73
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:45,279
Okay, we're going to take another look at today's vocabulary, but first, the answer to this week's quiz.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The music video has been around for a while, but in what year was MTV, the first dedicated

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:01,919
music video channel launched in the US? Was it A, 1981, B, 1982, or C, 1983, and Neil, you said?

76
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,960
I said it was definitely the early 80s.

77
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,879
Well, you're not wrong there, but which year exactly?

78
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,720
82.

79
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:18,080
Ah, well, you'll need to dig out a sad song to make you feel better now because the answer was 1981.

80
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,080
Oh, dear. I can feel my prolactin levels dropping already.

81
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,759
I'm sure you can't, but let's move on to the vocabulary.

82
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,520
If you can't stand something, it means you really don't like it.

83
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:32,799
A hormone is one of the body's natural chemicals.

84
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:39,120
And the hormone prolactin is connected with lactation, which is the production of milk by mammals.

85
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,120
Something that is comforting makes you feel better emotionally.

86
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,079
The phrase, what's going on has a very similar meaning to what's happening.

87
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:53,279
And an excess of something is too much or a more than normal amount of that thing.

88
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,839
Well, before you have an excess of our company, we should wrap up.

89
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,799
Thanks for listening, and we hope you'll join us again soon,

90
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:05,519
as ever, don't forget that you can find more from the BBC Learning English team online

91
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,599
across social media and on our very own app. Bye for now.

92
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:10,399
Goodbye.
