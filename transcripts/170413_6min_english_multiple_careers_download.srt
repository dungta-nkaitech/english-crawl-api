From BBC Learning English

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,359
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English,

6
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:15,919
the programme where we bring you an interesting topic

7
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,080
and six items of vocabulary.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,039
I'm Neil, today we're talking about jobs.

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,080
And I'm Dan.

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,080
And specifically we're looking at the trend

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,920
for having more than one job.

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,920
Yes, on that note, Dan,

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,320
will you ever ask this question as a kid,

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,480
what do you want to be when you grow up?

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,079
Do you remember your answer?

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,520
I wanted to be a ninja turtle.

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,520
And you?

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,640
Doesn't surprise me.

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,800
I think I wanted to be a professional footballer.

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,079
I wanted to play for England.

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:42,960
Hmm.

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,439
Well, for many people, that question gets harder

23
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:46,880
the older they become.

24
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,960
It's one reason why more and more people

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,240
have what we call Portfolio careers these days

26
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,400
so they can do a bit of everything.

27
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,119
A Portfolio as a noun means a case

28
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:58,960
for carrying large pictures.

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,000
Or it can mean the collection of pictures themselves.

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,079
But we also use it as an adjective

31
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:06,239
to describe groups of certain things.

32
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,759
In this case, careers.

33
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:08,480
Indeed.

34
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,200
We could say someone who is a part-time teacher

35
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,039
and a part-time musician has a Portfolio career.

36
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,400
Sounds like a good combination.

37
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,799
First, let's do today's question.

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,759
It's job-related.

39
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,159
Many surnames in English originally come from professions.

40
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,920
The surname Baker, for example,

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,679
was originally given to people who worked as da da da,

42
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:30,399
bakers.

43
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,879
But what about the surname Bond

44
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:35,519
as in 007 James Bond?

45
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:37,359
Who had this surname?

46
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,519
Was it A, farmers, B, spies, or C, guards?

47
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,199
It can't be spies, can it?

48
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:46,319
So I'm going to guess guards C.

49
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:46,799
Great.

50
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,799
Well, let's find out at the end of the program.

51
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,560
Now, the Portfolio career.

52
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,519
Emily Wappnick is the Canadian author of a book

53
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,439
called How to Be Everything,

54
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,959
a guide for those who still don't know what they want to be

55
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,079
when they grow up.

56
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,920
Which specific example of a Portfolio career does she mention?

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,879
More and more people are doing multiple things

58
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,319
and multiple jobs.

59
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,000
And it's not just to make ends meet.

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,079
A lot of people are choosing this kind of lifestyle.

61
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:14,879
They've got three different businesses

62
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,479
that are just thriving,

63
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,560
or they're a serial entrepreneur,

64
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,960
or they've got a career in two different areas.

65
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,000
There is a guy that I mentioned who is a psychotherapist

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,599
and a lootheer.

67
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,439
He makes violins,

68
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,600
and he is very successful in both.

69
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,319
Emily is clearly a fan of this kind of working.

70
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,280
She says she knows a man who's both a psychotherapist

71
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,159
and a lootheer, someone who makes violins.

72
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,920
She says this trend is more than just about working to make ends meet.

73
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,879
In other words, working to make enough money to live.

74
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,200
And she used another interesting expression,

75
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,960
a serial entrepreneur.

76
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,080
What's that exactly?

77
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,080
Well, an entrepreneur is someone who starts and runs businesses.

78
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,960
And the use of serial here as an adjective

79
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,240
describes someone who does the same thing again and again.

80
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,960
Though we should say the adjective is more often used

81
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,560
for criminal activity,

82
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,600
such as a serial killer or serial murderer.

83
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,280
Yeah, not the kind of portfolio career I had in mind.

84
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,439
A serial entrepreneur, on the other hand,

85
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,920
starts and runs business after business.

86
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,880
Another thing, because Emily believes the world of work

87
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,199
is changing fast, it's sensible to be able to do more than one thing.

88
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,039
In other words, it's wise to add another string to your bow.

89
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,000
A great phrase, which really just means to learn new skills you can use in the future.

90
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,680
I'd like to learn Japanese.

91
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,680
That would add another string to my bow.

92
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,560
So does me.

93
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:41,199
But choosing a portfolio career is not for everyone, of course.

94
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,439
It often simply comes down to money.

95
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:45,919
He is Charles Handy, writer and philosopher,

96
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,759
and the man who popularised the term portfolio career in the first place.

97
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:53,280
80% of the people at corporate jobs hate them.

98
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,519
Oh, I'm dissatisfied with them.

99
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,359
Whereas if you're doing your own thing,

100
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:02,079
80% of them really like the freedom and the entrepreneurial spirit,

101
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:04,000
even if they're not making an awful lot of money.

102
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,759
It's a balancing job, really.

103
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,759
You're free, but you're poor.

104
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,239
Oh, you're slaved, but you're richer.

105
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,919
Sounds like a difficult choice.

106
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,000
Be poor or be a slave.

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,359
What would you choose, then?

108
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,680
I'd rather be poor and free, thank you very much.

109
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,840
Well, let's explain a term he used.

110
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,040
A corporate job.

111
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,639
What does corporate mean?

112
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,000
Quite literally, it's the adjective from the term corporation.

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,639
A corporate job is a job at a big corporation,

114
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,400
company or organisation.

115
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,520
Usually well paid and with certain benefits.

116
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,319
Could we say James Bond has a corporate career?

117
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,360
Hmm.

118
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,400
Yes, I guess so.

119
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,360
And thank you for reminding me to answer today's question,

120
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,400
which profession does the surname Bond come from?

121
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,359
And I said the bonds were guards.

122
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:49,199
I'm afraid you were wrong.

123
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,359
Bonds were originally peasant farmers

124
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:53,919
who were bound to work for a particular lord.

125
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,799
This word goes back over 1,000 years.

126
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:59,039
The spying game came much later.

127
00:04:59,039 --> 00:04:59,839
Indeed.

128
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,879
Let's spy today's words once more.

129
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,159
We had portfolio, which can be used in different ways.

130
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:09,359
There's a portfolio career as well as the original meaning

131
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:11,439
of a portfolio of art.

132
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,319
Any others?

133
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,599
Yes, people talk about a portfolio of investments.

134
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:18,879
When you invest in several companies at once to reduce the risk.

135
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,159
Talking of money, we had to make ends meet.

136
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:25,040
People often work a number of different part-time jobs

137
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,240
to make ends meet, to make enough money to live on.

138
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,039
Though having a lot of part-time jobs is not the same thing

139
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,680
as being a serial entrepreneur.

140
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,439
Serial means doing something repeatedly, usually a crime.

141
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,680
And an entrepreneur is someone who starts and runs businesses.

142
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,439
I'd love to start a business.

143
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,879
First, I'd need to learn a new skill, add another string to my bow,

144
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,000
and learn yoga.

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,240
Then maybe one day I'll run a yoga business.

146
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,280
Not for me though.

147
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,040
I prefer the corporate life, a secure job in a big corporation.

148
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,840
Okay.

149
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,399
But then you can come to my yoga classes after work.

150
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,120
All right.

151
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,360
