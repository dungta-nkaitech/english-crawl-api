00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,080
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,919
And I'm Beth. Do you remember your first day at school, Neil?

4
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:22,400
Yes, I do. I changed schools quite a lot when I was a kid, so I had lots of first days,

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,160
and they were never easy. How about you, Beth?

6
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:34,399
Well, my mum always tells this story about how I was crying a lot on my first day,

7
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:41,840
but apparently as soon as she left, I was quite happy, so my mum spent the day being a bit sad

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,760
and I was completely fine. Well, yes, starting school and making new friends is difficult for many

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,920
children, but it's not just the kids who find it challenging. For mums and dads who drop their

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,960
kids off at the school gates in the morning and pick them up again at the end of the school day,

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,079
making friends with other mums can be just as hard. Here, BBC presenter Nule Mugavan discusses

12
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:12,719
this problem using the term mum friends. So if you are a mum dropping off or picking up the kids

13
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,719
this week, how do you feel about hanging out with other mum friends? I find that term kind of

14
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,920
interesting as well, mum friends, they're never called friends, they're called mum friends.

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,840
Do you struggle to make those relationships or do you thrive on them or are you perfectly happy

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:33,040
without them? Mum friends are usually the mums of other children in your child's class at school.

17
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,560
They might go for coffee together, help out with babysitting or chat about being a mother,

18
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,719
but is making new mum friends really the positive experience it's often described as,

19
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:50,719
or an additional stress for already overworked mothers? That's what we'll be discussing in this

20
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:57,120
programme along with some useful new vocabulary. And if the idea of mum friends is new to you,

21
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,000
why not take a minute to read through the list of vocabulary before you listen? It's easy to

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,680
find on our website, BBCLearningEnglish.com. Now Beth, I have a question for you. Another term often

23
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,919
associated with mum friends is play date, a time that parents arrange for their children to play

24
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:22,479
together, but according to the Oxford English Dictionary, where does the term play date come from?

25
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:29,759
Is the origin in A Australia, B New Zealand or C the United States of America?

26
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,079
I'm going to guess the USA, C. Okay, feeling confident? Yes.

27
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:41,119
Well, we'll see at the end of the programme. For some mums, dropping their kids off at school reminds

28
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,319
them of when they themselves were little and under pressure to make friends. Listen as mum

29
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,599
Jane, chairing them cook, describes these feelings to BBC Radio 4 programme Woman's Hour.

30
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,360
The school gates take you back to being back at school. It's like you said, a high school clique.

31
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,840
It's you've got the sporty mums over there, you've got the glam mums over there, you've got, you know,

32
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,080
and if you don't fit into one of those, it's really, really difficult to navigate.

33
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,480
And yet you're all there just because your children were born in the same year.

34
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,120
It's a really weird thing.

35
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:20,000
Jane says that mums often form cliques, small groups of people who like spending time together

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,920
and seem unfriendly towards others. For example, at Jane's daughter's school, there's a clique

37
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:32,320
of sporty mums and a clique of glam mums who put on makeup and dress up. Jane uses the adjective

38
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,280
glam as a shortened form of the word glamour, meaning attractive and exciting.

39
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,120
Problems start when someone doesn't fit into one of the cliques. If you fit into a group of people,

40
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,199
you feel you belong and are accepted probably because you are similar to them.

41
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,680
So some mums feel rejected from cliques and worry about their children being left out of play dates.

42
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,560
But other mums don't mind if people want to be friends, that's fine. And if they don't,

43
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,520
that's fine too. Being a mum is hard enough without adding more stress.

44
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:09,199
Jane definitely belongs to this group, as she explains to BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour.

45
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,920
I think I'd had some really bad experiences at baby groups, where you're trying to make your

46
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,319
child do yoga or paint when they're four months old and trying to bond with these other women.

47
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:25,600
And I just thought this is ridiculous. And I pretty much straightaway realised it was going

48
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,320
to be just down to luck if I met somebody that I clicked with.

49
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,879
Jane says it's down to luck if she makes mum friends. If you say something is down to luck,

50
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:40,879
you mean it depends on chance rather than any skill or effort you make. But there's always the

51
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:46,560
possibility you'll meet someone and click with them, become friends as soon as you start talking.

52
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,800
Well I know something that isn't down to luck Neil, the answer to your question.

53
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,600
Ah yes, I understood you about the origin of the term play date. Which country does it come from?

54
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,720
I think it's the USA. Well, Beth, you are right. So well done.

55
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,519
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, play date was first used in the Lincoln Daily Star

56
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:17,120
newspaper in Nebraska, USA, in 1915. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned

57
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,399
with play date, an arrangement that parents make for their young children to play together.

58
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:27,439
A clique is a small group of people who spend a lot of time together and may seem

59
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:33,040
unfriendly towards other people. Glam is short for glamorous, meaning a visually attractive

60
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:38,800
and exciting. If you fit into a group of people, you belong and feel accepted by them because

61
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,639
you're similar to them. If you say something is down to luck, you mean that it depends on chance

62
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,399
or luck rather than any skill or effort you make. And finally, if you click with someone,

63
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,639
you feel a friendly and positive connection when you meet them for the first time.

64
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,079
Once again, our time is up. Why not head over to the BBC Learning English website to find a quiz

65
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:05,599
and worksheet for this programme? Well, it's still fresh in your mind. See you again soon. Goodbye for now.

66
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,599
Bye.
