Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Neil.

3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,640
And I'm Rob. Do you enjoy your own company, Rob? Do you like being alone or do you prefer spending

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,480
time with friends? Well, recently I haven't seen my friends much because of coronavirus.

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,519
In fact, I've hardly seen anyone this past year.

6
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,679
It sounds like Rob has become a bit of a hermit, someone who lives alone and apart from society.

7
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes, I've been forced to spend time alone, but it wouldn't be my choice. I'd much rather be socialising

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,960
and visiting friends. If Rob, the idea of being alone does not appeal to you,

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,240
it might be hard to understand why anyone would choose to be a hermit, but some people do,

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,439
and in this programme we'll be hearing some of the reasons why.

11
00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:02,559
Throughout history and across all cultures, there have been people who choose to leave behind

12
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,400
the life and people they know to live in isolation and silence. People like Christopher Wright,

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,759
an American man who lived in complete isolation in the forests of Maine for nearly 30 years.

14
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,000
When Hikeers discovered his tent, all they found was an alarm clock. So my quiz question is this,

15
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,879
why did Christopher Wright, the hermit of the main words, need an alarm clock?

16
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:31,039
Was it A, to remind him when to hide his tent? B, to frighten away wild animals?

17
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:35,280
Or C, to wake him up at the coldest part of the night so he didn't freeze to death?

18
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, if he wanted to be alone so much, I guess he needed to be invisible. So I'll say A,

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,759
to remind him to hide his tent.

20
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:50,159
Okay, Rob will find out the answer later. Christopher Wright may be an extreme example of someone

21
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,079
seeking solitude, but there are many other motivations for becoming a hermit.

22
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,159
Some people are looking for peace and silence, and for others it's about being closer to God,

23
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,079
focusing on what's inside and finding a sense of joy.

24
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,560
Meng Hu is a former librarian who now runs a website all about hermit. He says that in ancient times,

25
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,840
many Chinese hermit seeking solitude were followers of the philosopher Confucius.

26
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,879
Here's Meng Hu talking about Confucius to BBC World Service program, the wife actor.

27
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:29,680
His dictum was something like when the emperor is good serve, when the emperor is evil,

28
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:37,919
recluse. And so over 1000 years at least, there were a lot of recluse. There were a lot of educated men

29
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:46,400
who simply couldn't tolerate any more evil. They simply dropped out and they would migrate to small

30
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:55,200
villages to farms. Meng Hu mentions Confucius' dictum. A dictum is a short statement or saying which

31
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,439
expresses some wise advice or a general truth about life. Confucius' dictum advised that when the

32
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:07,759
emperor was evil, people should become recluse. People like hermit who live alone and avoid contact

33
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:14,719
with others. In the interview, Meng Hu uses recluse as a verb to recluse, that this is very uncommon,

34
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:20,800
a more modern way of saying this is to drop out, to reject the normal way society works and live

35
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,960
outside the system. A bit like the hippies in the 1960s you mean. Right, although most hippies weren't

36
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,840
looking for isolation, they did have something in common with hermit, the desire to challenge

37
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,800
society's rules and conventions. Someone who combines the hippie and the hermit is Catholic writer

38
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,280
Sarah Mateland. Part of a long tradition of Christian hermit's, Sarah spent 40 days and nights alone

39
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:52,240
on the Isle of Sky seeking God in the silence of the remote Scottish island. For her, the magic of

40
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,600
silence is something to be embraced and taught to children. Here she explains more to BBC World

41
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:05,120
Services, the wife actor. Most people first encounter silence in bereavement, in relationship

42
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:12,400
breakdown and in death. And that seems to me about the worst place to start. But people say, well,

43
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,759
what should we do? I mean, never ever use go to your room on your own as a punishment. You use it

44
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,120
as a reward. Darling, you've been so good all day, you've been so helpful. Why don't you go to your

45
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:31,199
room for half an hour now and be on your own? Treat the reward! Sarah says that most people experience

46
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:37,279
silence after a bereavement, the death of a relative or close friend. She also thinks parents

47
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:42,399
should never tell their children, go to your room as a punishment. Instead being alone should be a

48
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:48,480
treat, a reward or gift of something special and enjoyable. That way, children learn that being

49
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:54,719
alone can actually be enjoyable. I'm still wondering about that American Christopher Wright. I suppose

50
00:04:54,719 --> 00:05:00,000
living alone in the woods was a treat for him. I suppose so, but why did he need an alarm clock?

51
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,720
Ah yes, your quiz question, Neil. I thought maybe it was to remind him to hide his tent. Was I right?

52
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,680
Well, incredibly robbed, the answer was c'd wake him up at the coldest part of the night so he

53
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,079
didn't freeze to death. That's someone who really wants to be left alone. A hermit's, in other words,

54
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,800
or a recluse, two ways of describing people who live alone and avoid others.

55
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,720
Okay, let's recap the rest of the vocabulary starting with dictum, a short saying often giving

56
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,160
wise advice or expressing a general truth about life. People who drop out reject the normal

57
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,800
rules of society and live outside the system. Many people experience solitude after a bereavement,

58
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,120
the death of a close friend or relative. And finally, a treat is a reward or gift of something

59
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,560
special and enjoyable. That's all for now, but whether you're listening alone or with others,
