4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,120
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,280
And Sam.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,960
We often hear phrases such as dream big or reach for the stars

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,800
which reflect an optimistic view of life.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,560
Are you an optimist, Sam?

9
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:32,159
I hope so. I try to see the positive side of life,

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,079
even when something bad happens.

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,280
It sounds like you're a glass half full person.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,000
Someone who always thinks that good things will happen.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,039
Hmm, how about you, Neil? Are you optimistic?

14
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,480
Look, things go wrong all the time. That's a fact of life.

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,920
Call me a pessimist if you like, but I'm just being realistic.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,519
Hmm, it sounds like Neil is more of a glass half empty person,

17
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:57,519
but the truth is that the age-old debate between optimism

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,320
and pessimism is more complex than we think.

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,760
Yes, whether you're a sunny optimist or a gloomy pessimist,

20
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,040
maybe determined more by your birthplace and your age,

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,159
than your attitude, as we'll be finding out in this programme.

22
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,640
Great. I've got a good feeling about this, Neil.

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,760
But first, as usual, I have a question for you, Sam.

24
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,400
Psychologists define optimism as an attitude which overestimates

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,960
the chances of good things happening to you,

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,640
while underestimating the chances of bad things occurring.

27
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,159
So, what proportion of the British population do you think

28
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,640
describe themselves as optimistic?

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,040
Is it A, 20%, B, 50% or C, 80%?

30
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,599
Oh, to the largest, 80%.

31
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,599
Okay, Sam, we'll find out if your optimistic answer is the correct one

32
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,799
later in the programme.

33
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,359
Someone who probably wouldn't agree with you, though,

34
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,000
is BBC World Service listener Hannah.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,920
Hannah grew up in Germany before moving to the United States.

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,040
She thinks Americans tend to be more optimistic than people back home in Germany,

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,719
as she told BBC World Service programme Crowdscience.

38
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,519
Well, I think the stereotypical perceptions of Germans

39
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,439
is that we're quite pessimistic,

40
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,240
and that kind of tends to come across as being a bit of a Debbie Downer.

41
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,000
When an actuality Germans just tend to be ever planners for all

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,480
eventual negative eventualities as well.

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,840
So, that's kind of us being pessimistic, but actually being cautious.

44
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,039
As opposed to, for example, what I've noticed in America

45
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,079
that a lot of people tend to be hyper optimistic,

46
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:34,479
I've always admired how Americans tend to be able to sugarcoat everything.

47
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:39,039
As a stereotypical pessimist, Hannah sometimes feels like a Debbie Downer.

48
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:44,159
This expression is American slang for someone who makes others feel bad

49
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,280
by focusing on the depressing aspects of things.

50
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,560
Americans, on the other hand, are typically seen as optimists,

51
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,199
who tend to sugarcoat things, make things seem better than they really are.

52
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,879
According to Hannah, many Americans are hyper optimistic.

53
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,319
She uses the prefix hyper to say that there is too much of a certain quality.

54
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,759
Hyper-sensitive people are too sensitive.

55
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:10,400
A hyper-optimist is too optimistic.

56
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,439
Besides your country of birth, age is another consideration in the optimism debate.

57
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,000
When we're young, we have our whole life ahead of us,

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,079
and it's easier to optimistically believe that everything's going to be all right.

59
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:26,800
The belief that everything's going to be fine is called the optimism bias.

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,759
It isn't fixed, but changes as we age.

61
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,719
Something new a scientist, Professor Tally Sherrett,

62
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,079
explained to BBC World Service Programme Crowd Science.

63
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:39,360
So, it's quite high in kids and teenagers.

64
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,439
They think, oh, everything's going to be fine, you know.

65
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,759
And then it goes down, down, down, and it hits rock bottom in your midlife,

66
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,960
at which point the optimism bias is relatively small,

67
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,759
and then it starts climbing up again, and it's quite high in the elderly population.

68
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:59,439
And that goes absolutely against our view of the grumpy old man or woman.

69
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,759
After starting out high in children, the optimism bias hits rock bottom.

70
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,400
The lowest possible level in middle age.

71
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
Often because of work pressures,

72
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,840
family responsibilities, or caring for elderly parents.

73
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,520
But optimism seems to increase again as we get older.

74
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,800
This is surprising as it goes against the image we have of the grumpy old man,

75
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:26,480
a phrase to describe someone who complains a lot, is moody, and gets easily annoyed.

76
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,920
Optimistic women, meanwhile, can look forward to longer, healthy lives.

77
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,439
Good news for you then, Sam, that I'm sticking with my pessimism.

78
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,160
If I anticipate things going wrong, then I don't get disappointed when they do.

79
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,680
That's actually a fairly positive way of looking at things, Neil.

80
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,480
But I'm not sure if most people would agree with you, or maybe they would.

81
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,560
It depends on the answer to your question.

82
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,240
Right, I asked Sam what proportion of British people describe themselves as optimistic?

83
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,920
And optimistically, I said it was C, 80%.

84
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,159
Which was the correct answer?

85
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,840
Of course it was.

86
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,640
Whether you expect good or bad things to happen to you, you're probably right.

87
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,840
So why not focus on the sunny side of life, Neil?

88
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
That way you've got nothing to lose.

89
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,200
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from this program, Sam.

90
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,680
You're certainly a glass half full person,

91
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,320
someone with an optimistic attitude to life.

92
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,879
And you're something of a Debbie Downer.

93
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:30,879
American slang for someone who brings everyone down by talking about the negative side of things.

94
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,199
If you sugarcoat something, you make it appear more positive than it really is.

95
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:42,480
The prefix hyper is used before an adjective to show having too much of that quality.

96
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,800
For example, hypercritical means being too critical.

97
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,120
If something hits rock bottom, it reaches its lowest possible level.

98
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,199
And finally, the phrase grumpy old man can be used to describe someone who always complains

99
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,479
is intolerant and gets annoyed easily.

100
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,519
A bit like Neil.

101
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,279
Thank you very much.

102
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,000

Goodbye for now.

105
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:13,120
Bye.
