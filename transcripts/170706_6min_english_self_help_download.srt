4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,679
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil and today we're going to improve ourselves.

5
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:20,960
Aha, how could we possibly get any better?

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,240
I'm Rob and yesterday's topic is self-help and the self-help industry.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,320
What do we mean by self-help?

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,520
Well, it means trying to improve yourself, psychologically, economically or in other ways,

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,679
without seeking official help.

10
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:41,280
For example, bookshops these days are full of titles which claim to boost your self-confidence,

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,079
your wealth, your love life or your career.

12
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,640
Yes, in just seven days. There's a clear demand for this kind of thing.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,359
The self-help industry is worth $10 billion in the US alone.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,079
That's a lot. That includes things like gym memberships, diet plans and life coaching apps.

15
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,280
We'll be looking at why, but first, the self-help industry has been around for a long time.

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,560
Which of these well-known books was published first?

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,239
Is it A, How to Win Friends and Influence People?

18
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,039
B, Think and Grow Rich?

19
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:17,519
C, The Law of Attraction.

20
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:19,439
Hmm, could do us some help here.

21
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,000
I'll go for the first one, How to Win Friends and Influence People.

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,759
Okay, well, before we go further, let's take a trip around a bookshop in Manchester

23
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,200
to find out which self-help books are selling well.

24
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,120
Let's listen to Emma Marshall, a manager at Waterston's bookshop.

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,079
What's popular now?

26
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,479
At the moment, we're in the tidying up and getting rid of things, Trend.

27
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,319
But before that, we saw Colour Again, which became a huge thing.

28
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,559
It's kind of dwindling now, because these sorts of trends come in and then they go.

29
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:55,359
Like last year, we saw Huger, which is the Danish art of living well, apparently.

30
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,280
So we're taking from all sorts of cultures.

31
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,199
And so I think right now, the trend is clearly about slowing down in your life.

32
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,280
Emma says there are a couple of trends right now.

33
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,359
A trend here means something new, which is popular for a period of time.

34
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:13,439
Yes, so she mentioned tidying up and getting rid of things.

35
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,599
Would you buy a book about tidying up, Neil?

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,359
I'd be more likely to buy a book about it than actually tidy up.

37
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:23,199
She also mentioned a current trend about slowing down in our lives.

38
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,799
Well, I can agree with that.

39
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:27,599
And previous trends included colouring in.

40
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,759
These books have black and white outline pictures that you fill in with colours.

41
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,799
I used to do that as a child, very therapeutic.

42
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:38,159
Therapeutic, making you feel more relaxed and less anxious.

43
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:40,959
It's related to the word therapy.

44
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,799
Although the colouring in trend is dwindling, it's becoming weaker.

45
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,800
They're selling fewer colouring in books.

46
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,480
So trends calm and go, but the industry is going from strength to strength.

47
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,439
To go from strength to strength means to remain strong or get even stronger.

48
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,400
Why?

49
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,280
Dr Jennifer Wilde, a psychologist from Oxford University, believes that the internet is a big factor.

50
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,480
We've got used to searching for solutions online,

51
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,560
and now these solutions even include how to fix or improve our lives.

52
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:18,479
And psychologist Caroline Beaton, writing on Forbes.com, said she believes that millennials

53
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,520
are a big factor.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,759
How do we define the term millennial?

55
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,560
Also known as Generation Why, are people born between the mid-1980s and early 2000s?

56
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,960
It's a common term in the news, often because people born in this time in the West are

57
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,199
seen to have certain characteristics.

58
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,599
Yes, they're sometimes described as lazy and obsessed with themselves.

59
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,680
And while that's not necessarily true,

60
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,120
Caroline Beaton says millennials are highly self-critical.

61
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:51,680
Self-critical. They are aware of their own faults, which also means they're more likely to spend

62
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,439
time or money on self-help. She says they spend twice as much as Generation X's.

63
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,639
Generation X refers to people born between the late 1960s and around 1980.

64
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:08,560
And one more possible reason why the self-help industry does well, it's very resistant to recessions.

65
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,960
When the economy does badly, as we say, it goes into recession, people are perhaps even more likely

66
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,600
to reach for self-help to improve their situation.

67
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:24,480
So there we are. Now, let's go back to another recession, the great depression of the 1930s in

68
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,720
America. And to my question about which self-help book was published first?

69
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,639
Well, I said a, how to win friends and influence people.

70
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,639
In fact, two of these books were published in the late 1930s.

71
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,000
How to win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie was first in 1936.

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,079
It has since sold over 30 million copies. Think and grow rich by Napoleon Hill was published

73
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,879
in 1937 and is believed to have sold over 100 million copies.

74
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,439
That's a lot of self-help. Have you read either of them?

75
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,240
I haven't read either of them, but perhaps I should.

76
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,719
Well, before we rush home and improve ourselves, let's improve our vocabulary.

77
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,080
Of course, today we had self-help, the activity of improving yourself physically,

78
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,200
mentally or in other ways, often through courses and books.

79
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,560
There are lots of trends in the self-help industry, and we also see trends in fashion,

80
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,880
in music, in popular culture, like the trend for men to grow beards.

81
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,920
Are you talking about me?

82
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,760
Anyway, I think the beard trend is dwindling. It's getting smaller, less influential.

83
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,120
Really? Hmm. I'll stroke my beard here.

84
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,560
I think that's very therapeutic. It makes me relax and feel good.

85
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,879
Maybe you're right. What about our next phrase to go from strength to strength?

86
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,720
Well, you could say a business is going from strength to strength,

87
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
if it's earning a lot of money. Indeed.

88
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,360
And what about our term for young people? Millennial.

89
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,959
Are you a millennial, Rob?

90
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,879
Didn't quite scrape in there. I'm still a generation X, okay.

91
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,480
But I do like to think I'm in touch with what millennials do,

92
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,079
which includes having lots of different social media accounts.

93
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:03,839
Just like us. Do look up BBC Learning English on Facebook,

94
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,319
Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.

95
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,399
And good luck with your self-improvement.

96
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,199
Goodbye. Bye.
