Hello, this is 6 Minute English and I'm Rob.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,719
I'm Sam, hello.

5
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,080
Now Sam, we're going to be talking about tattoos.

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,039
Are you a fan?

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,160
Of tattoos.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,359
Hmm, well I don't have one, but they can be quite impressive works of art.

9
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,600
Well, I'm not that keen on tattoos.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,320
I mean, who wants things drawn on their body?

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,280
Hmm, it sounds like you need some convincing, Rob.

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,079
Maybe our discussion today will change your mind.

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,399
Maybe, but as you're a fan of them, here's a question for you to answer.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,079
According to the Guinness World Records, the record for the most tattooed person in the world

15
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,200
goes to Lucky Diamond Rich from New Zealand.

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,159
Do you know how much of his body is covered by tattoos?

17
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,719
Is it 80%, B90% or C100%?

18
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,679
What do you think Sam?

19
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,919
Well, it's got to be 100% if he is the most tattooed man, surely.

20
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:08,560
Oh, not necessarily, but we'll see if you're right at the end of the programme.

21
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,959
Now, let's talk more about tattoos.

22
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:12,640
I know many people have them.

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,000
Sometimes it's a picture of an animal, like a small gecko.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,400
Sometimes it's words like, I love you or the name of a loved one.

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,040
And then there are the huge designs spread across someone's back, chest or arm,

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,880
like Footballer David Beckham has.

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,680
Hmm, well, he's no stranger to a tattoo, Paula.

28
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:37,920
A Paula is the name of the shop where a tattoo artist draws a tattoo on you with ink and a needle.

29
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,280
Oh, needles out.

30
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,000
Okay, so you need some convincing.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,080
So let's hear from Lucy Parfitt, YouTuber and tattoo fan.

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,400
Here she is speaking on the BBC's Smart Consumer Podcast.

33
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,799
I'm quite a creative person and ever since I first discovered tattoos,

34
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,079
I thought it was a really cool way of expressing yourself.

35
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,599
I'm quite a visual person as well.

36
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,120
So for me, it really just looked really cool.

37
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:12,800
And it made me think more about my own personality and how I could express that in creative ways.

38
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,200
Right, so Lucy describes herself as a creative person.

39
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,400
When you're creative, you're imaginative and you like to experiment with new ideas.

40
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,280
Yes, Rob.

41
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,400
And tattoos are a good way to be creative.

42
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,960
Trying out different designs and colours, it's a good way to express yourself.

43
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,480
Here, to express yourself means to show how you feel in a particular way.

44
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:45,120
Okay, so some people express themselves through singing or wearing particular clothing,

45
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,639
but here she's expressing herself through the images on her skin.

46
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,679
But what happens if you want to change what you want to express?

47
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:56,000
Well, then it's time for a new tattoo.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,560
Okay, well, I know that the tattoo industry is big business now,

49
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,919
which means it's popular and making lots of money.

50
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,639
I've heard that one in five people now have a tattoo.

51
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,479
Not you yet, Rob.

52
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:12,239
But it has certainly become a trend in recent years.

53
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,919
And it's something tattoo artist Lee Clements has noticed.

54
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:20,079
Also speaking on the BBC's Smart Consumer Podcast,

55
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,239
he explains why he thinks that is.

56
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:29,359
The thing for me that has obviously changed massively over the last possibly 10 years is you see a lot

57
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:35,199
of celebrities getting tattooed with that comes the fact that you're going to get people who want

58
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,039
to copy them or it becomes almost like a fashion thing.

59
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:44,319
So we do see certain tattoos sort of become in a trend.

60
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,479
And yeah, so I guess it kind of dilutes that value a little bit.

61
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:56,079
Ah, so it's celebrities, famous well-known people from TV, film and fashion,

62
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:58,319
that have possibly driven the trend.

63
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,120
People want to copy them or it's what he says is a fashion thing.

64
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,719
So you have a tattoo because it's fashionable, which means it's popular at a particular time.

65
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:14,560
And one of the downsides, the negative things about just having one to be fashionable

66
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,840
is it dilutes the individuality of having one.

67
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,280
Dilute means to make something less strong or less valuable.

68
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,199
Well, I'm not going to get one anytime soon, except maybe a big six on my arm to remind me

69
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,680
that we only have six minutes of this program.

70
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,920
So I'd better reveal the answer to the question I asked you earlier.

71
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,639
According to Guinness World Records, the record for the most tattooed person in the world

72
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,199
goes to Lucky Diamond Rich from New Zealand.

73
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,399
Did you know how much of his body is covered by tattoos?

74
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:48,399
And I said 100%.

75
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,480
Ah, well done Sam, that is correct.

76
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:57,919
He's held the certified record since 2006 of being 100% tattooed.

77
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,160
This includes tattoos inside his eyelids, mouth and ears.

78
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,640
Wow, I wonder who gets to see those.

79
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,680
Ha ha.

80
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,600
Okay, well now it's time to recap the vocabulary we've discussed today,

81
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,759
starting with a parlour.

82
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,200
That's the name for a shop or room where certain businesses carry out their trade,

83
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,240
such as a tattoo parlour, a massage parlour, or a nice cream parlour.

84
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,600
A creative person is someone who uses imagination and experiments with new ideas.

85
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,640
And when you express yourself, it means you show outwardly how you feel and what you're thinking.

86
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,800
If something is big business, it's an activity that is currently popular and making lots of money.

87
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,160
And something that is fashionable is popular.

88
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,520
And when something becomes popular, it can dilute its value or uniqueness.

89
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,480
So it becomes less strong or less valuable.

90
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay, thank you Sam.

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,759
That's all for now, but there's plenty more on our website at BBCLearningEnglish.com.

92
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,040
If you can't remember the address, why not tattoo it on your arm?

93
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,879
You can also find us on social media and on our app.

94
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:07,839
Goodbye for now.

95
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,560
Bye.
