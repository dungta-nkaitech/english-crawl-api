00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,200
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:19,240
And I'm Beth. Women today are having fewer babies. More women are delaying having children

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:26,879
until their 40s. The period of 10 years in life between 40 and 49. And some women are

5
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:32,679
giving birth in their 50s, their 60s, even their 70s.

6
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:37,920
There are many reasons behind the trend for older mums, including better access to education

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,239
and careers. But there are also health risks to having children later in life. So in this

8
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:49,039
programme we'll be asking when are you too old to have a baby. And as usual we'll be

9
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,039
learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

10
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:58,960
But first I have a question for you Neil. In 2019, Mangayama Yaramati gave birth to

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,200
twins in the state of Andhra Pradesh, South India. But these were no ordinary twins because

12
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:14,000
Mangayama was the oldest recorded woman ever to give birth. So how old was the oldest

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:25,640
ever mum when she gave birth? Was she a 53 years old, b 63 years old or c 73 years old?

14
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,439
I'm going to guess 63.

15
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,120
Okay Neil, we'll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme.

16
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:40,439
Professor of Reproductive Science at University College London, Joyce Harper, has been studying

17
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:46,920
the trend of women choosing to have babies later in life. Here she shares her discoveries

18
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,000
with BBC World Service programme Global Story.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,560
Twenty thirty years ago women were having children at a much younger age. Now it's become

20
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,560
quite normal for women in their 30s. As we see with the world data, there's many countries

21
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,000
where women have their first birth over the age of 30. But this is quite a new phenomena.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,639
That's why this term geriatric mother unfortunately still lingers.

23
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:18,719
Professor Harper uses the word phenomena to describe the trend for older mothers. Phenomena

24
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:24,879
are unusual or significant facts and events that exist and are talked about. People often

25
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,400
get this wrong, but the plural form is phenomena and the singular is phenomenon.

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,080
The concept of older mothers is still quite a new phenomenon and attitudes towards them

27
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,640
are changing.

28
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,800
Mothers over the age of 35 used to be called geriatric, a word many found offensive. Fortunately

29
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,760
this term is no longer used, but social disapproval of older mothers still lingers. If something

30
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,040
lingers it continues to exist longer than usual or expected.

31
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:00,200
Yes, in some cultures older mothers are still disapproved of. But wait a minute Neil,

32
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,920
it takes two to make a baby. What's the man's role in all of this?

33
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:10,839
Well unlike women whose ability to naturally get pregnant declines sharply in their 40s

34
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:17,439
men's fertility last longer. Rolling Stone singer Mick Jagger famously had his eighth child

35
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:24,239
with his 29 year old partner at the age of 73. So are older fathers more socially acceptable

36
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,159
than older mothers? Yes, things Professor Harper, as she explained to BBC World Services

37
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:37,159
global story. We do have a bit of agenda problem it because if this was a man in his 60s,

38
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:42,280
70s and even 80s and he's father to child, most people would pass him on the back. But

39
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,919
they're probably patting him on the back because he's absolutely got so much younger partner.

40
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:53,560
But if we've got a woman in her 60s, 70s or got a bit 80s having a child, then it does

41
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,039
have a sort of shock reaction and makes people feel uncomfortable.

42
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:05,159
Professor Harper thinks that society is more accepting of older fathers than older mothers.

43
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:11,959
A 70 year old man can still father a child. He can make a woman pregnant who then gives birth.

44
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:19,000
And most people would pat him on the back. An idiom meaning give someone praise or congratulations.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,039
On the other hand says Professor Harper, God forbid a woman having a baby in her 80s.

46
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,640
Here the phrase God forbid is used as a way of saying you hope something will not happen.

47
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:37,680
There's another side to this story though. In the West, young women from Gen Z, the generation

48
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,240
born since the year 2000, are saying they won't have children at all.

49
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,759
In more traditional countries meanwhile, a woman's role is as a mother and many pray to God

50
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:54,720
to be blessed with a child. Which is exactly what happens to Mangayama Yaramati, the

51
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,840
South Indian woman I asked you about in my question, Neil. In 2019, she became the oldest

52
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:10,160
recorded woman ever to give birth. Right and I guessed she was 63 years old at the time.

53
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:18,800
Which was the wrong answer I'm afraid. In fact, she was even older, 73. Okay, let's recap

54
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,440
the vocabulary we've learnt in this programme starting with the phrase in your 40s. Which

55
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:30,519
describes the period of 10 years in someone's life when they're aged between 40 and 49.

56
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:36,920
Phenomena describes any significant facts or events that we know exist and can be observed

57
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:43,720
and discussed. If something lingers, it continues to exist longer than usual or expected.

58
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,959
The verb to father means to make a woman pregnant who then gives birth to a child.

59
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:55,239
The idiom Pat someone on the back is used to describe giving someone praise, congratulations

60
00:05:55,239 --> 00:06:00,439
or encouragement. And finally, the expression God forbid is a way of saying that you hope

61
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:05,079
something will not happen. Once again, our six minutes are up but don't forget to join
