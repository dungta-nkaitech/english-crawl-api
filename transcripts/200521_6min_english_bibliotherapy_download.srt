00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,559
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:17,839
And I'm Georgina.

7
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:20,559
What type of books do you like to read, Georgina?

8
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,960
I love reading crime fiction.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,000
You know detective stories by authors like Ruth Vendel or Agatha Christie.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,079
Really, do you find them relaxing?

11
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,960
I wouldn't say relaxing exactly, but I get really involved in the story,

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,920
trying to work out who the murderer is, then finding out on the last page.

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,200
That's interesting because today we'll be looking at how books can help us relax

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,079
and feel more alive during troubled times.

15
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,719
We'll be finding out how reading is one of the best ways to find relief from the pressures

16
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,920
of modern life.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,200
Neil, are you talking about bibliotherapy?

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,080
Amazing detective skills, Georgina.

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,040
Exactly.

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,000
Bibliotherapy is the prescription of books as a remedy to sickness.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,960
It's been around since 2013, when the UK charity Reading Agency

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,400
published a list of books that doctors could offer to patients,

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,560
tackling topics from depression, to dementia, to chronic pain.

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,840
Since then, 1.2 million readers have borrowed the Schemes books from libraries.

25
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,320
It's so successful that it's about to be extended to children as well.

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,920
I wonder which books have been most popular over that time.

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,800
In fact, that's my quiz question for today.

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,079
What is the best-selling book of all time?

29
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,400
Is it A, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by J.K. Rowling?

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,439
B, A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens?

31
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,280
Or C, Don Quixote by Miguel Desavantes?

32
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,680
I'll say A, Harry Potter.

33
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,480
Okay, well, we'll find out later if you are right.

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,960
In bibliotherapy, people meet up to read together.

35
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,840
Professor Philip Davis, who runs these reading groups, believes they help the participants

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,600
come more alive.

37
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,719
Here he is speaking to BBC Radio 4's You and Yours about what he's discovered.

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,480
Above all, that it's not to do with scanning, with quick reading when they're reading literature.

39
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,759
If they're just scanning, if you're just looking for information,

40
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,959
you go fast, it's very easy, it's automatic.

41
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,759
But when literature begins to do something more complicated than that,

42
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,799
in an area that emotionally you care about,

43
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:36,959
the brain begins to work from different parts, from a different hemisphere,

44
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,399
and it gets excited.

45
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:40,719
It gets pre-emotional.

46
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,759
You can see the brain coming to life,

47
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,399
and it's that life that is important in terms of these reading groups.

48
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,039
One type of reading is scanning.

49
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:59,919
Reading quickly in order to find specific information or skimming the page to get a general understanding.

50
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,280
But the real therapy happens when a group reads literature.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,280
Written works such as novels, poems or plays, which are thought to have artistic merit.

52
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,680
When group members read literature, their brains get excited and start working from a different

53
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:23,199
hemisphere, a word meaning half a sphere, usually half the earth, or in this case the human brain.

54
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:28,800
Reading literature in this way makes both the left and right hemisphere of the brain come to life,

55
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,960
start to be activated again after a quiet period.

56
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,240
And it's this coming to life that proves the therapeutic effects of bibliotherapy.

57
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,360
Here's Professor Davis again explaining how the benefits of group reading are observed.

58
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,159
There are two methods really.

59
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:53,280
You can have easy G where you put electrodes on the scalp and it measures electricity so that you

60
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,040
can have a print off of a graph of the sudden leaps that can happen at particular moments in

61
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,920
reading a poem or short story, or you can go into the scanner, the FMIRI, and there the blood flow,

62
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:12,799
the oxygen indicates again changes in the configuration of the brain as it takes in this new stimulus.

63
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,959
The benefits of reading literature with others can be felt by group members as they begin

64
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,120
to feel more alive and able to cope with life's ups and downs, but they can also be measured

65
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,479
scientifically by recording brain wave activity.

66
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:34,079
This can be done by carefully attaching metal wires called electrodes to the reader's scalp.

67
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,479
The skin under the hair on the head.

68
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,800
Brain activity is then measured by giving the reader a stimulus,

69
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,759
something that encourages activity in people.

70
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,959
In this case, it could be a poem or novel to read.

71
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,639
Or something really stimulating, like a detective story.

72
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,399
Or a work of literature, which reminds me of today's quiz question.

73
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,479
I asked you to name the most popular book of all time and you said,

74
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,680
a Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,

75
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,160
which is definitely the most popular book in the 21st century,

76
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,680
but number one of all time, selling over 500 million copies, is seeing savante's don Quixote,

77
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,280
and there's even a detective in it.

78
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,200
Today we've been discussing the therapeutic effects of meeting up with others in a reading group

79
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,879
to read literature, writing of artistic values such as stories and poetry.

80
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,879
In contrast to scanning, reading quickly to find facts,

81
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,079
reading groups use literature as a stimulus,

82
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,040
something that encourages activity in people.

83
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,560
Reading stimulates both the left and right hemispheres,

84
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,399
the two halves of the brain and increases emotional activity,

85
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,560
which can be measured on the scalp.

86
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,199
The skin under the hair on a reader's head.

87
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,000
All of which helps people dealing with trauma to come to life feel active

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,639
and more alive after a quiet period.

89
00:05:56,719 --> 00:05:58,879
Right, that's it. I'm off to the library.

90
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,719
If only you could.

91
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:06,159
Thanks for listening and remember you can find many more stimulating topics and vocabulary

92
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:10,159
here at 6 Minute English on BBC Learning English. Bye for now.

93
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:10,800
Bye!
