00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,359
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,800
And I'm Rob.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,839
You look very pale, Rob. Are you okay?

7
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:25,120
Well, I was a rather boozy wedding party last night and I had a bit too much champagne.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,920
Oh.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,320
Do you know any good hangover cures?

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,399
A hangover is the headache and sickness you can feel after drinking too much alcohol.

11
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,439
And a cure is something that makes you better.

12
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:44,640
Well, I'm tea total. I don't drink alcohol, so I'd say the best hangover cure is not to drink in the first place.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,120
You don't believe in hair of the dog then?

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,519
No, Rob. I don't. Hair of the dog is the belief that drinking more alcohol when you already have a hangover

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,280
will make you feel better.

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,480
And boozy means lots of alcohol.

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,520
I can see I'm not going to get much sympathy from you.

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,280
So I'm going to take a couple of painkillers and let you tell everyone what the subject of today's show is.

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,960
All right then. Well, it's drinking too much, Rob.

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,040
And I have a question for you.

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,439
What is the name of the main process involved in producing alcohol?

22
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,080
Is it a fermentation, b, hydration,

23
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:24,480
or C, purification?

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,640
OK, I know it has something to do with water.

25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,039
So I want to go for b, hydration.

26
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,840
It rings a bell from my chemistry lessons at school.

27
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,719
Oh, well, we'll find out later on in the show whether you were listening carefully in class, Rob.

28
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,560
Well, no comment.

29
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,920
Well, most people are aware of the links between smoking and cancer,

30
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,200
but fewer are aware that drinking alcohol is linked to an increased risk of future health problems.

31
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,439
The UK government is currently trying to raise awareness with their new guidelines on how much it's safe to drink.

32
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,439
Let's hear what Dr. Michael Mosley has to say about health risks.

33
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,480
Unfortunately, whatever level of alcohol you are drinking,

34
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,480
it is likely to increase your risk of some forms of cancer,

35
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:14,000
particularly breast cancer, but also other rare forms of cancer like head neck and throat.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,080
The risks are quite low at moderate drinking, but they do rise rapidly.

37
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:24,719
So any drinking at all, even one small glass of wine with your evening meal,

38
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,839
raises your risk of cancer? Is that right?

39
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:31,919
Yes, and the health risk increases with the amount you drink.

40
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,039
But I thought wine was supposed to be good for you.

41
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,239
It's a popular belief, but medical evidence doesn't seem to support this view.

42
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,639
Let's listen to Dr. Michael Mosley again on this.

43
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:48,000
Now, there's long been this idea that there is this marvelous stuff in Red Wine called Resveratol,

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,479
which is said to reduce your risk of all sorts of things.

45
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,680
Unfortunately, the amount you would have to consume would be so huge that the

46
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,280
downsides of drinking Red Wine would swiftly overwhelm them.

47
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,879
And the downside of something means the disadvantages.

48
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,960
Now, Alice, what's your favourite tip-all?

49
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,879
Oh, well, I don't have one, Rob, because I'm T total, remember?

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,280
A tip-all is another way of saying an alcoholic drink.

51
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,039
I enjoy beetroot and kale smoothies with a dash of turmeric and ground pepper.

52
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,520
Cale? Oh, yeah, that's disgusting.

53
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,759
Now, smoothie is a thick drink made of fruit or vegetables blended with milk or yogurt or water.

54
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,719
Well, I like sweet stuff. Maybe a banana smoothie with some honey,

55
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,520
but beetroot and kale, that sounds disgusting.

56
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,240
Don't knock it until you've tried it.

57
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,360
And that means to try something before you criticise it.

58
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,400
Okay, okay. But seriously, a glass of wine makes me happy and relaxed.

59
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,400
And there are health studies that suggest being happy is good for your health.

60
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,680
That's true, but eating and drinking healthily makes me happy.

61
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,960
Now, moving on, it's important to put the risk of drinking alcohol or horrible vegetable smoothies.

62
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,040
In context.

63
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,120
Statistically, drinking alcohol regularly represents just under 1% lifetime risk of death,

64
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,360
but actually an hour of TV watching or eating a bacon sandwich a couple of times a week is more

65
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,000
dangerous. Well, that's what I like to hear. Though, what if I'm watching TV enjoying a beer and

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,920
a lovely bacon sandwich? Does that triple my lifetime risk of death?

67
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,759
Mmm, well, Rob, you better ask Professor David Spiegelhalter at the University of Cambridge that

68
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,639
question. I was quoting him earlier about the TV watching and the bacon sandwich.

69
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,639
He works with statistics, but this is for another programme.

70
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,319
Now, let's get on to the serious matter of today's quiz question. I asked,

71
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:53,680
what is the name of the main process involved in producing alcohol? Is it a fermentation,

72
00:04:54,399 --> 00:05:02,240
B, hydration or C purification? Well, I said B, hydration. Though you were skeptical,

73
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,399
weren't you, Alice? Yes, and I was right to be skeptical.

74
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,120
Which means doubtful, because B is the wrong answer I'm afraid, Rob.

75
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:18,959
The main process involved in producing alcohol is fermentation, which is the process in which yeast

76
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:27,519
or bacteria changes sugar into alcohol. Hydration is the process of making your body absorb water,

77
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,079
and purification is the act of removing some harmful things from something.

78
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:39,599
Actually, have this glass of water, Rob. Hydration is a good hangover cure, much better than

79
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:44,399
hair of the dog. Ah, cheers, Alice. Now, let's hear the words we learned today.

80
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:55,039
They are hangover, cure, tea total, hair of the dog, boozy, downside,

81
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:02,400
tipple, don't knock it until you've tried it, skeptical, fermentation.

82
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,560
Well, that's the end of today's six-minute English. Keep hydrated, and don't forget to join us again

83
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,560
soon. Bye-bye.
