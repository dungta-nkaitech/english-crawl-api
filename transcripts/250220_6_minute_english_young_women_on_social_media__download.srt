00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,640
Hello, this is 6-Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:19,519
And I'm Beth. In this programme, we're discussing the positives and negatives of social media

4
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,640
in the lives of young people. And this is a really trending topic at the moment

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,880
because of what's happening in Australia, where a new law to limit under 16-year-olds access

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:38,000
to social media is being debated. Neil, tell me one good thing and one bad thing about having

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,560
social media in your life. Well, one good thing is it means I can see what friends are doing

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,359
who live far away. And one bad thing is it's really addictive and a massive waste of time.

9
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,200
Well, it's interesting to hear a man's perspective, Neil, because when it comes to issues like

10
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:05,760
cyberbullying, it's often young women who are most affected. So soon we'll be hearing from women

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,239
in different countries about their online experiences. And remember, you can find all the vocabulary

12
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:18,560
and a worksheet on our website, BBCLearningEnglish.com. But first, I have a question for you, Beth.

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,519
In 2024, which was the most regularly used social media platform in the world?

14
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:32,960
Was it A, Facebook, B, Instagram or C, TikTok? Oh, I'm going to say TikTok.

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,640
Well, we'll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now let's start with the positive

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,520
side of social media. As a politics student at Oklahoma University, 21-year-old Haley Hurst

17
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:52,239
campaigned in the 2024 US presidential election. Here she explains one benefit of social media

18
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,879
to BBC World Service programme Pick of the World. I do think social media has played a

19
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:02,079
huge role in educating young voters on different policies and different people who are running.

20
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:09,039
I know Trump has recently said that he has a soft spot in his heart for TikTok. With the growth

21
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,639
of social media, it has sparked a lot more debate. I think my generation two has seen so many

22
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:21,279
dramatic things happen. Haley thinks one good thing about social media is that it sparks debates

23
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:29,039
and conversations. It causes debates to start. She comments that Donald Trump is a fan of social media

24
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:35,359
by saying he has a soft spot for TikTok. If you have a soft spot for something or someone,

25
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:41,839
you feel affectionate and fond of it. You like it a lot. But of course, that's not the whole story.

26
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,120
Increasingly, young women are reporting the negative impact social media is making on their

27
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,080
lives and the pressure they feel to appear perfect online, especially from men. Manvi Sharma,

28
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:01,039
age 28, is a business woman and model with a large Instagram following who lives in Delhi, India.

29
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:08,560
And Kemi Adyemi is a 26-year-old travel blogger from Lagos in Nigeria. Both young women

30
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,599
discuss these social media worries with BBC World Service Programme. Pick of the world.

31
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,640
Don't you to shrink yourself so that they can be the bigger person. They get to listen to what

32
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,920
they're afraid say about you, what their family says about you, and they're not able to stand

33
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,640
up for you to say, oh, I know this person. I believe she's not doing these things for all that

34
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:04,560
reasons. Manvi thinks some men are intimidated by her popularity on Instagram. Intimidated means

35
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,400
to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence. She feels people gossip about her

36
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:18,160
posts and photos using expressions like, oh my gosh, and oh my god, to express their shock or surprise.

37
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,800
And Kemi agrees. She says that on social media, some people want her to shrink herself,

38
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,879
a phrase meaning that you underuse your full potential in order to avoid making people feel

39
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:37,680
uncomfortable or to fit in. When she's bullied online, Kemi says that these people don't stand

40
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,000
up for her. To stand up for someone means to defend or support someone who's being criticised

41
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,040
or bullied. And I think it's time you reveal the answer to your question, Neil.

42
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,519
I asked which was the most regularly used social media platform in the world in 2024. Facebook,

43
00:04:55,599 --> 00:05:02,000
Instagram or TikTok. What did you say, Beth? TikTok. I'm afraid you're wrong. It's Facebook

44
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,039
with over three billion regular users. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this program

45
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,879
starting with the verb spark, meaning to cause something such as a debate or argument to start

46
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,599
happening. If you have a soft spot for someone, you feel affection for them. You like them very much.

47
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,280
To be intimidated means to feel frightened or nervous because you lack confidence in a situation.

48
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,840
The expressions, oh my gosh and oh my god, are exclamations of strong feelings like shock,

49
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,160
surprise, anger or disbelief. If you shrink yourself, you make yourself smaller and don't use

50
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,400
your full potential in order to make others feel comfortable or to fit in with them.

51
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:51,040
And finally, to stand up for someone means to be vocal in defending a person who is being

52
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:57,439
bullied. Once again, our time is up, but if you're ready for more, head over to the BBC Learning

53
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,800
English website to try the worksheet with a quiz for this program. See you there soon. Goodbye.
