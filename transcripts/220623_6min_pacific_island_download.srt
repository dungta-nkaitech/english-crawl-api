Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,080
I'm Sam.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,240
And I'm Rob.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:27,519
What do Britain, Greenland, Australia, Hawaii and Cuba all have in common, Rob?

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,800
Are you planning your summer holidays, Sam?

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,359
Or is it that they're all islands?

9
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,159
That's right, Rob. They are all islands.

10
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:38,640
But that's about all they have in common.

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,280
There's as much variety in the world's islands as in the people who live there.

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,960
In tourist holiday magazines,

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,280
Pacific islands like Fiji, Tonga and Tahiti look like paradise with tropical rainforests,

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,560
white sandy beaches and turquoise blue sea.

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,679
But in reality, life is far from paradise for these island communities.

16
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:05,840
In 2022, the island of Tonga suffered a tsunami, a huge wave caused by an earthquake

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,480
that flowed in land, killing people and causing large-scale damage.

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,240
The destruction was terrible and added to the continuing crisis of rising sea levels,

19
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,640
threatening the island's survival.

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,520
In this programme, we'll be hearing some Pacific islander voices and, as usual,

21
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:25,759
learning some new vocabulary too.

22
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,560
But first, I have a question for you, Rob.

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,519
We already named some islands, large and small,

24
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:36,719
but how much of the world's population do you think lives on an island?

25
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,280
Is it A, 11%?

26
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,079
B, 15% or C, 20%.

27
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,079
Oh, that's a tricky question.

28
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,159
It can't be that many, so I'll guess A, 11%.

29
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,759
Rob, I'll reveal the correct answer at the end of the programme.

30
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:01,200
The South Pacific is home to thousands of low-lying islands dotted across miles of Pacific Ocean.

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,479
With rising sea levels, it's predicted that many of these islands will simply disappear

32
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,359
in coming years.

33
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:13,359
And if that wasn't bad enough, the effects of climate change are making life difficult for

34
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:15,680
these island communities right now.

35
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,640
The tsunami that hit Tonga left the main island Tonga Tapu in ruins.

36
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,840
One of those leading the cleanup was offer Maiazi Kasami, manager of the Pacific Climate Change Centre.

37
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,400
She told BBC World Service programme Business Daily the extent of the problem.

38
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,439
The projected impacts of climate change on agriculture and fisheries will

39
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,240
undermine food production systems in the Pacific.

40
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,280
Our Pacific people are also dependent on crops, livestock, agriculture, fisheries,

41
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,000
handicrafts for food security and income.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,400
And these sectors are also highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.

43
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,439
The economy of many islands like Tonga depends on tourism, farming or fishing,

44
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,639
and on handicrafts, skillfully making traditional objects like jewelry,

45
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:06,800
textiles or pottery by hand.

46
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,920
These are usually sold to tourists, but when tsunamis keep the tourists away,

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,239
local jobs become vulnerable, unprotected and open to damage.

48
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:22,479
This affects not only handicrafts, but Tonga's ability to produce enough food to feed its

49
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,839
population, something known as food security.

50
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:29,439
As the effects of climate change hit the local economy,

51
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,319
young people are leaving Tonga to find work elsewhere.

52
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:38,799
Tonga youth employment and entrepreneurship is a project working with local organisations

53
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,160
to help young people start businesses and find jobs.

54
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,840
Here's Project Director Lucia Latu Jones,

55
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,040
speaking with BBC World Services, Business Daily.

56
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,040
So, you know, it can be very emotional and heartbreaking to see

57
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:06,640
what's happening in our island, but it's even harder when you see young people

58
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:16,639
coming through, just looking for a chance to help their families, you know,

59
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,959
for them to get on their feet again.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,360
So, the question we ask ourselves as an organisation is how can we address these

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,079
challenges to better support our people so that they can get back on their feet,

62
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,599
you know, feed their families?

63
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,840
We can hear the emotion in Lucia's voice when she describes the situation facing young Tongans

64
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,280
as heartbreaking, causing strong feelings of sadness.

65
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,960
She says her role is to help people get back on their feet,

66
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,480
an idiom which means be able to function again after having difficulties in life.

67
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,720
The many problems Tonga's face are made worse by perhaps the biggest problem of all,

68
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,880
the fact that poverty, hunger and the loss of their traditional culture

69
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,680
is being caused by the carbon emissions of larger countries halfway around the world.

70
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,000
If we all learn to adapt our lifestyle, just as specific islanders have done,

71
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,640
it may not yet be too late to change the fate of their island paradise.

72
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,160
And the fate of the millions living on other islands too, which reminds me of my question, Rob.

73
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:31,439
11% of us are islanders, which works out as over 730 million people.

74
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,840
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from this programme starting with Sunami,

75
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,840
a very large wave that flows inland causing death and destruction.

76
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,920
Many islanders produce handicrafts, handmade traditional objects like jewelry,

77
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,440
textiles and pottery.

78
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,600
Someone who is vulnerable is weak or unprotected.

79
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:58,800
The phrase food security refers to a country's ability to produce enough food to feed its population.

80
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,640
When something is heartbreaking, it makes you feel very sad.

81
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,200
And finally, to get back on your feet,

82
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,960
means to be okay again after having difficulties in life.

83
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,360
Once again, our six minutes are up.

84
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,320
Goodbye for now.

85
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,040
Bye.
