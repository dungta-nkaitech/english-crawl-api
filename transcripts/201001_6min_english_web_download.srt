Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,400
And I'm Sam. What's the matter, Neil? You sound upset.

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,240
Well, I am Sam. I just spent an hour working on my computer when it suddenly froze.

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,039
I lost everything and had to start all over again.

6
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,960
Oh, that's so frustrating. Like pop up internet ads and buffering videos that never play.

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,759
Modern computers in the internet have revolutionised the way we live today,

8
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:42,399
bringing us the world with a click of a button,

9
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,679
but not everyone feels happy about these technological developments.

10
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,480
While potentially acting as a force for good and progress,

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,280
the internet also provides a way of spreading hate and misinformation.

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,640
And for some people, the worldwide web remains a mysterious and confusing place.

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,159
In this programme, we'll hear about a new academic subject called web science.

14
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,760
Web science studies the technology behind the internet.

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,120
But from the human side, it's also interested in how people interact with each other online.

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,280
So we'll be asking whether studying web science could make the internet

17
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,599
better for humanity in the future.

18
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:24,239
But first, it's time for our quiz question.

19
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,159
I wonder what the pioneers of the internet would think about how it is used today.

20
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,519
So the question is, who invented the worldwide web?

21
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:36,719
Was it A, Bill Gates, B, Tim Berners-Lee, or C, Steve Jobs?

22
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:42,079
Well, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were the brains behind Microsoft and Apple Mac.

23
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,959
So I'm going to say C, Tim Berners-Lee.

24
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:47,039
Okay, Sam will find out later.

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,719
Now, because of coronavirus, the annual web science conference was held online this year,

26
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,440
its theme was making the web human centric.

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,680
One of the conference's key speakers and co-founder of the new discipline of web science

28
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,439
was Dame Wendy Hall.

29
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,040
Here she is, speaking to the BBC World Services Digital Planet.

30
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,040
People think about the web as a technology, but actually it's co-created by society.

31
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,039
We put the content on, we interact with the technology, with the platforms,

32
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,519
with the social media networks to create it.

33
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:22,719
What we study is as how that works as an ecosystem.

34
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,959
This is coming together of people and technology, and it's very interdisciplinary,

35
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,680
very sociotechnical, and of course these days a lot of it is powered by AI.

36
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,120
Web science is not only interested in the technology side of the internet.

37
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,719
As a subject, it's very interdisciplinary, involving two or more academic subjects,

38
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,319
or areas of knowledge.

39
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,919
Web science combines digital technology with subjects ranging from psychology and robotics

40
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,520
to economics and sociology.

41
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,879
Exchanges between humans and the internet can be seen in social media networks,

42
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,800
websites, apps and computer programs like Facebook and Instagram,

43
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,159
which allow people to use electronic devices to communicate and share information.

44
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,159
This view of technology sees the internet as an ecosystem, a complex pattern of relationships

45
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,280
and mutual influences that exists between all living things and their environment.

46
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,800
One ongoing and topical example of websites helpfully interacting with humans

47
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,759
is the COVID contact tracing app.

48
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,000
You might think the mobile phone app, which tracks movements and contact between people

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,199
to combat coronavirus, would be a useful practical application of internet technology.

50
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,079
But is Carly Kind, director of the Ada Lovelace Institute in Cambridge,

51
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,440
explained to the BBC World Services Digital Planet?

52
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,200
Things are never that straightforward.

53
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,240
Actually, there's a lot of more fundamental questions that haven't been answered yet,

54
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,520
such as, is Bluetooth even an adequate mechanism for doing what it says on the tin,

55
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,240
which is detecting contact between two people?

56
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,360
The trials so far show that it's not actually that great.

57
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,760
And so do we know for sure that these apps work and they work in the way we want them to?

58
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,439
Do we get the public health information that we need?

59
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,160
Apps like this are designed to support public health,

60
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,720
services to improve the standard of health of a country's general population.

61
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,520
But Carly thinks the mechanisms used must be suitable and adequate.

62
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,680
They must actually work or do what it says on the tin.

63
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,120
An informal idiom, meaning work exactly as it is intended to.

64
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,040
To find this out, trials, tests to discover how effective or suitable something is,

65
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,960
are carried out over a period of time.

66
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:46,720
The kind of trials which were carried out during the invention of the internet in the first place,

67
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,280
right Neil?

68
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,960
Ah yes, the invention of the internet or to be more accurate, the worldwide web.

69
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,520
In our quiz question, I asked you who invented the worldwide web.

70
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,480
What did you say Sam?

71
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,840
I said B, Tim Berners-Lee.

72
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,920
Well, you're a first-class web scientist, Sam, because that is the correct answer.

73
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,000
Great. In this program, we've been hearing about web science, a new interdisciplinary subject,

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,439
combining several areas of study, which investigates the ecosystem of the internet,

75
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,160
the complex pattern of interconnections between humans and their environment.

76
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,759
Social media networks, websites and apps like Facebook, which let people use

77
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,720
electronic devices to communicate on the internet, show how humans and technology can

78
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,920
successfully interact.

79
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,960
A new COVID contact tracing app is currently undergoing trials,

80
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,280
tests to see if it works effectively.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,440
This will discover if it does what it says on the tin, works as it's supposed to.

82
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,240
If successful, by alerting people to coronavirus risks, the app will support public health.

83
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,840
Services aimed at improving the health of the general population.

84
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,240
And that's all for us for now.

85
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,960
And we hope you'll join us again soon for more topical English vocabulary here at 6 Minute

86
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,240
English. Bye for now.

87
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,960
Bye-bye.

88
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,560
6 Newt English from the BBC.
