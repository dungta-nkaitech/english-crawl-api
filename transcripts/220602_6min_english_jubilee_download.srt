00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,399
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm Neil. And I'm Sam.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,280
People in the UK are enjoying a four-day holiday,

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,000
as part of the celebrations for Queen Elizabeth II's Platinum Jubilee.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,839
A Jubilee celebrates the anniversary of a special event

9
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:33,759
and the word is mostly associated with the royal family.

10
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,880
In 2022, Queen Elizabeth II celebrates her Platinum Jubilee,

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,840
commemorating 70 years since she became Queen in 1952.

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,480
People are doing all kinds of things to celebrate,

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,000
from large events at Buckingham Palace and St Paul's Cathedral,

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,960
to smaller street parties in towns and cities up and down the country and abroad.

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,120
In this programme, we look at the Platinum Jubilee in an unusual way

16
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,919
by hearing about a cake competition to make the official Jubilee cake,

17
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:05,840
the Platinum pudding.

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,840
And as usual, we'll be learning some related vocabulary as well.

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,519
This isn't the first celebration of Queen Elizabeth's reign.

20
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,200
The period of time when a monarch rules a country.

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,840
In 1977, the Queen celebrated her silver Jubilee,

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,400
marking 25 years as Queen,

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,080
followed by her golden Jubilee in 2002

24
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,359
and her diamond Jubilee in 2012.

25
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,960
But what's so special about this year's Platinum Jubilee

26
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,120
is that Queen Elizabeth II is the first British monarch ever to spend

27
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,040
70 years on the throne.

28
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,880
And I have a question about it, Sam.

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,040
Queen Elizabeth II is Britain's longest ever-raining monarch,

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,640
but who was the previous longest-raining before her?

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,600
Was it A, Henry VIII, B,

32
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,039
Elizabeth I or C, Queen Victoria?

33
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,479
Hmm. I know it's C, Queen Victoria.

34
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,439
Okay. I'll reveal the answer at the end of the programme.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,359
As the first monarch ever to have a Platinum Jubilee,

36
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,319
many celebrations are being planned for the Queen.

37
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,959
These include an official birthday parade,

38
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,519
Trooping the Colour, which ends with jet planes flying over Buckingham Palace

39
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:19,519
and the Platinum Pagent,

40
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:21,599
a live concert in front of the palace,

41
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,519
featuring music and dancing puppets of the Queen's favourite pets,

42
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:28,879
her corgi dogs, and a performance by Ed Sheeran.

43
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,799
And that's just in London.

44
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:32,159
All across the UK,

45
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,799
street parties are being held for people to eat

46
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:36,799
and drink with friends and neighbours.

47
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:39,919
There's a tradition of inventing a new food dish

48
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,439
to commemorate Jubilee's,

49
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,560
going all the way back to the Victoria Sponge,

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,799
a cake named after Queen Victoria.

51
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,879
This year, a competition was held to find a new dish

52
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,759
to become the official pudding of the Jubilee.

53
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,039
Here's BBC reporter Daniela Ralf to explain more.

54
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,400
First, there was a Victoria Sponge, then, Coronation Chicken.

55
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,159
Now we have a Queen Elizabeth II Platinum pudding.

56
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:09,680
The winning lemon Swiss roll and amareti trifle

57
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,159
is a twist on a traditional trifle,

58
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,280
with layers of Swiss roll, jelly, custard,

59
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,680
mandarins, amareti biscuits, and cream.

60
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,920
In 1953, a mix of chicken and curry cream sauce

61
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,879
called Coronation Chicken was invented

62
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,120
to celebrate Queen Elizabeth's coronation,

63
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,520
the ceremony of which she was made queen.

64
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,920
This year, competition winner Gemma Melvin

65
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,719
has invented a lemon and Swiss roll,

66
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,319
amareti trifle,

67
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,560
as the official Jubilee cake.

68
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,520
Trifle is a sweet, cold pudding made of three layers,

69
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,760
a layer of fruit and cake,

70
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:50,239
a layer of custard, and a top layer of cream.

71
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,399
Gemma's Jubilee trifle is a twist on a traditional trifle.

72
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,759
When talking about food, people use the phrase

73
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,359
a twist on something to describe a new variation

74
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:04,239
of a traditional recipe using different,

75
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,599
exciting ingredients.

76
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,439
Gemma learned her winning recipe from her grandmother's.

77
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,719
She wants her trifle to be the people's pudding,

78
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,639
something to be enjoyed by everyone.

79
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:17,839
Here is Gemma Melvin, describing how she felt

80
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,479
to discover her trifle had been chosen

81
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,560
as the official platinum pudding.

82
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,560
I cannot believe it.

83
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,120
Everything that I was up against

84
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,159
was just the most beautiful deserts and puddings

85
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:32,000
with beautiful stories.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,199
This quite humble trifle has won

87
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,879
is a bit surreal.

88
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,560
Gemma describes her trifle as humble, modest, and not proud.

89
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,759
Although the pudding contains ingredients like

90
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,079
amarethi biscuits and cream, which are good enough for a queen,

91
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,120
she wanted to base it on a humble trifle,

92
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,680
something everyone around the country can make.

93
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,319
Enjoying a bowl of Gemma's platinum pudding

94
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,560
sounds like a great way for some to celebrate

95
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,800
the queen's 70-year reign.

96
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,439
Which reminds me of your question, Neil.

97
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,040
We know Elizabeth II has reigned for 70 years,

98
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,840
but who was the second longest serving monarch?

99
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,959
I said it was C, Queen Victoria.

100
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm glad you were so sure, because you were correct, Sam.

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,719
Victoria was queen for almost 64 years,

102
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:23,839
which is a long time, but not as long as Elizabeth.

103
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,719
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from this programme

104
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:28,799
about the queen's Jubilee,

105
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:32,239
a celebration of the anniversary of a special event,

106
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,399
usually involving the royal family.

107
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,599
A king or queen's reign means the period of time

108
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:38,879
they rule a country.

109
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,120
A coronation is the ceremony at which someone is made monarch,

110
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,480
the king or queen.

111
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,079
Trifle is a popular pudding made of a layer of fruit and cake,

112
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,279
a layer of custard, and a top layer of cream.

113
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:54,560
If you say a food dish is a twist on something,

114
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,000
you mean it's a variation of a traditional recipe,

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,480
using new and exciting ingredients.

116
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,560
And finally, someone who is humble is modest and not proud.

117
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,719
If you were inspired by this recipe,

118
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:08,159
why not try making it?

119
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,439
But that's all from us.

120
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,320
Goodbye for now.

121
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:10,960
Goodbye.
