Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Beth.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And I'm Neil. Here at 6 Minute English, we discussed animals adapting their behaviour

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
in response to climate change in earlier programmes. But we didn't focus on one species in detail.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So in this programme, we'll take a look at an especially unwelcome insect, the mosquito.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Every year, mosquito-borne diseases kill around three-quarters of a million globally,

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
with most deaths occurring in children under five.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
With warming temperatures, mosquitoes are now spreading to new areas, including Europe.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We'll hear about dengue fever, one of the diseases they bring, and as usual, we'll learn some useful new vocabulary as well.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But first, I have a question for you, Neil.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Dengue isn't the only sickness mosquito spread, so which of the following is also a mosquito-borne disease?

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Is it A, Ebola, B, cholera, or C, malaria?

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I think the answer is C, malaria.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay, Neil, we'll find out later in the programme.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
One country at the forefront of the problem is Indonesia, which in recent years has seen a surge in dengue-related deaths.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Here's Dr. Jerry Ariani, a pediatrician in the Indonesian capital Jakarta,

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
speaking with BBC World Service programme, the climate question.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Fever and muscle aches are common symptoms for a viral infection.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But if they're accompanied by other symptoms, for example, red spots on the skin,

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
or maybe there is a fever that lasts for three days, we can suspect that it's dengue fever.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Day 5 to 7 is the critical window for a dengue fever patient.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Sometimes parents don't know about this critical window, and when they bring the child to the hospital, it's difficult for us to help.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Dr. Ariani describes the symptoms of dengue, the signs that indicate the presence of a disease in your body.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
These include fever, when your body temperature is higher than normal, and your heart beats very fast.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Dengue is not fatal, if you receive treatment quickly.

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
There is a critical window between days 5 and 7 of the infection, when a patient needs treatment to survive.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
A critical window refers to a limited period of time, during which action must be taken to achieve a certain result.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
In any case, in Indonesia, have now grown over 150,000 and many blamed climate change.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Periods of drought, when little rain falls, force people to collect drinking water in buckets, giving mosquitoes places to breed.

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
According to Professor Manisha Kulkarni, an epidemiologist from the University of Ottawa,

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:30,000
higher temperatures also mean higher rates of replication, something she explains to Paul Connelly, presenter of BBC World Services, the climate question.

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The higher the temperature, the quicker that the mosquito can actually replicate that virus within its body, and then be able to transmit it back to another host when it bites.

33
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Manisha also talked about the link between poverty and dengue, which is an important part of this jigsaw, isn't it?

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Because as more and more people move to cities and live in cramped conditions with poor sanitation, then more and more people are exposed to dengue, so there's something of a dumb and no effect here.

35
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Dengue spreads when an infected mosquito bites a host, an animal that another animal lives on or uses for food.

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And Professor Kulkarni is concerned about poverty as much as climate change.

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
She calls it an important part of the jigsaw, an idiom meaning a part of a complicated situation that helps you understand it.

38
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Poverty forces many Indonesians to move into crowded cities with poor sanitation.

39
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:37,000
These provide the perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes creating a domino effect, a situation in which something bad happens causing further negative consequences.

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The domino effect means that dengue is spreading not just in Asia, but in parts of the world which didn't have it before, including France, Spain and Italy.

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But the news isn't all bad. Fortunately, technology is getting better at slowing the spread, including early warning systems that can predict dengue outbreaks months in advance, and the ongoing work to produce a vaccine, all of which hopefully mean an end to dengue and similar diseases.

42
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Speaking of which, Beth, what was the answer to your question?

43
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I asked you to name another mosquito-borne disease besides dengue.

44
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And I said malaria.

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Which was the correct answer.

46
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Dengue, malaria and yellow fever are all diseases spread by mosquitoes.

47
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this programme, starting with symptom, a sign of the presence of a disease in your body.

48
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
A fever is a medical condition which increases your body temperature and heartbeat.

49
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
A critical window is a limited period of time during which action must be taken to achieve the desired outcome.

50
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The word host has several meanings, but in biology it's a plant or animal that another plant or animal lives on as a parasite or uses for food.

51
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The idiom part of the jigsaw or part of the puzzle means a part of a complicated situation that helps you to understand it.

52
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And finally, one negative event causing another, which in turn causes another, can be called a domino effect.

53
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye.
