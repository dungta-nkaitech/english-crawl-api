6-Night English from BBCLearningEnglish.com

2
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,919
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:13,040
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,879
In every language, there's one word which has special power over us, our name.

5
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:24,640
Our senses, feelings and whole identity are closely linked to our name.

6
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:30,560
Yet strangely, our name isn't usually something we choose. It's given to us by our parents.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,799
But what if the name you are given at birth doesn't fit?

8
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:41,760
Maybe you simply don't like it. Or maybe there are bigger reasons for wanting to change your name.

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,040
Reasons connected with historical injustices or unfair events in the past.

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,400
In this programme, we'll be meeting two people whose family history

11
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,560
has caused them to consider changing their name. And as usual, we'll be learning some useful

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,759
new vocabulary as well. Sounds good, Beth. But first, I have a question for you.

13
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,640
My name, Neil, is a British name and was given to me at birth.

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,280
But names change a lot between cultures and religions. Many Muslim boys are named Mohammed.

15
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,879
Indian boys are often called Ram or Krishna. And in Mexico, some boys are named Hesus.

16
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:27,920
So, according to a recent global survey, what is currently the world's most popular boy's name?

17
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,319
Is it A, Hesus, B, Muhammad or C, Noah?

18
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,280
Hmm, I guess it's Mohammed.

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,120
Okay, Beth, I'll reveal the answer at the end of the programme.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,640
In Britain, a person's first name is also called their Christian name.

21
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,319
And in Christianity, many names have a religious meaning.

22
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,959
The name John, for example, means God is good. Anderson Jeremiah is the Bishop of Edmonton.

23
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:00,319
He was born in South India, but he doesn't have a traditional Indian sounding name.

24
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:06,159
Here, Bishop Jeremiah explains the roots of his name to BBC World Service programme Heart and Soul.

25
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,079
It was a name of one John Anderson. He was a first educational missionary who came and worked and

26
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,720
set up several schools in South India who had very noble ambitions.

27
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,920
But also, as with any missionaries, he was a big collaborator of the colonial establishment at that

28
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:36,320
point in time. So, he has a very strong baggage that goes with it. So, Anderson is my Christian name.

29
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,880
And Jeremiah is my dad's name.

30
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:47,039
Bishop Anderson Jeremiah's name comes from another man, John Anderson, a Christian missionary

31
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:53,039
during the British Empire. The history of the British Empire in India is controversial,

32
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:59,199
with many views on all sides. Bishop Jeremiah thinks that some of the empire's missionaries

33
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:06,319
were noble, meaning admirable or morally good. But nevertheless, John Anderson was part of a violent

34
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:13,120
and exploitative empire. Bishop Jeremiah uses the word baggage to describe the beliefs,

35
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,519
especially outdated or unhelpful beliefs, which influence how people think.

36
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:23,919
Emotional baggage tends to influence the feelings of one individual, while historical baggage can

37
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:32,159
affect whole societies. In India, names serve an important purpose to signify social status.

38
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:40,240
Low status Indians, including Bishop Anderson's grandparents, escaped social discrimination

39
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,719
by converting to Christianity and taking another Christian name. But elsewhere in the British

40
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:53,840
Empire, names were connected with something completely un-Christian, slavery. Black British writer

41
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,000
Professor Robert Beckford is an activist theologian at the University of Winchester. His surname,

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,879
Beckford, is a slave name, passed down from his enslaved African ancestors in 18th century Jamaica.

43
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,719
Here Professor Beckford talks to BBC World Service programme, Hathen Sol, about his decision

44
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:20,480
to name his son, Micah. Before my son is named Micah, Micah Beckford after one of the prophets.

45
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,600
So I do like the idea of people in the biblical tradition who speak truth to power, who ruffle

46
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:32,480
people's feathers, who challenge the injustice. I haven't thought of giving myself a biblical name.

47
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:40,720
I could never find a name that really resonated with me. The phrase to speak truth to power

48
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,480
describes times when people non-violently resist an oppressive force, such as a government

49
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:52,720
or corporation, by telling the truth. And if you ruffle someone's feathers, you upset or annoy them.

50
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,080
Maybe it's not so much your name as what you do with it that counts. Anyway, it's time to

51
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,760
reveal the answer to your question, Neil. Yes, I asked you which boy's name is currently the world's

52
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:12,720
most popular and you guessed Muhammad, which was the correct answer. Right, let's recap the vocabulary

53
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,080
we've learned, starting with injustice, a situation lacking fairness or justice.

54
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:24,159
In British English, your Christian name is your first name. The name you are given at birth.

55
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:32,079
The adjective noble means admirable or morally good. Baggage refers to beliefs and feelings,

56
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:37,599
especially outdated or unhelpful ones, which influence how someone thinks.

57
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:43,839
The idiom speak truth to power describes when people non-violently resist an oppressive force,

58
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:49,759
such as a government or corporation, by telling the truth. And finally, to ruffle someone's

59
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:57,359
feathers means to upset or annoy them. Once again, our six minutes are up. But remember to join us

60

61
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,120
Goodbye for now. Bye.
