00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,440
Hello, this is 6M8English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,559
And I'm Rob.

7
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,879
Now, all over the world, people love to eat,

8
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,120
and most of us have favourite food we like to cook.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,519
Often this involves a recipe.

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,480
That's written down instructions explaining how you combine

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,000
the different items of food you are going to cook,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,159
the ingredients, into a meal.

13
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,920
My favourite recipe is for bangers and mash,

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,399
a cheap and popular British meal made of sausage and mash potato.

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,159
Mmm.

16
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:45,439
Cooking is a big part of our lives,

17
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,000
something pleasurable we do with others,

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,280
and a way of discovering the flavours and tastes of other cultures.

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,200
In this programme, we'll be doing just that,

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,600
discovering the food culture of Ghana in West Africa,

21
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,640
and hearing about one woman's quest to preserve her country's traditional recipes.

22
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,480
And as usual, we'll be learning some related vocabulary along the way.

23
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,879
But before we start, I have a question for you, Rob.

24
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:16,079
Your favourite recipe is the classic British dish, bangers and mash.

25
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,520
It's easy to understand why mash potato is called mash,

26
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,359
but how did sausages come to be known as bangers?

27
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,840
Is it A?

28
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,200
Because bang is an old-fashioned word for pork,

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,799
B, because sausage-making machines used to make a banging noise,

30
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:38,680
or C, because sausages would explode in the frying pan, going bang.

31
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,920
I think it's A, bang is an old-fashioned word for pork.

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,359
Okay, Rob, I'll reveal the correct answer later.

33
00:01:46,359 --> 00:01:50,040
Food writer Abna Afejima was born in Ghana,

34
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,560
but moved to Canada as a child.

35
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,400
After school, she would go for burgers and fries with friends,

36
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,840
before heading home to eat traditional Ghanaian food with her family.

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,680
Food cooked with ingredients like dawa-dawa,

38
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,680
a spice made from roasting locus beans, and fufu.

39
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,159
Her mother's cooking gave Abna a love of traditional recipes.

40
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,879
So much so that five years ago, she moved back to Ghana

41
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,640
to rediscover her country's food culture.

42
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,240
But when she arrived, Abna was surprised

43
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,400
how much things had changed.

44
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,960
Many traditional spices and ingredients were no longer being used,

45
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,280
and it was more common to see tomato ketchup

46
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,680
than Ghanaian Chipotle sauce.

47
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,920
Here Abna describes how her grandparents used to cook in the old days

48
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,879
to BBC World Service program, the food chain.

49
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,000
So they would actually cook the lamb,

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,760
you would cook the planting,

51
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,120
and they would use the mortar and the pestle to actually pound it.

52
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,080
Now in Ghana, you could just buy potato flour

53
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,520
and just make fufu on the stove.

54
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,039
But we're losing that, right?

55
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,800
That communal experience of cutting the lamb

56
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,840
and cutting the plantain and cooking it.

57
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:07,480
Abna's grandparents made fufu the traditional way,

58
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,719
using ingredients like yam and green bananas called plantains.

59
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:14,560
These were placed in a mortar and pestle.

60
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,560
Cooking equipment made of a bowl, the mortar,

61
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,719
and a heavy stone, the pestle,

62
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:22,400
which is used to grind ingredients together.

63
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,639
The traditional method was to pound fufu

64
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:28,520
to crush it into a paste or powder.

65
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,639
But nowadays, many people buy ready-made flour

66
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,960
and cook fufu the modern way on a stove.

67
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,159
For Abna, this represented an unwelcome departure

68
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,520
from ancestral ways of cooking,

69
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,360
and she decided that something had to be done.

70
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,919
Here's Ruth Alexander,

71
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,840
presenter of BBC World Services,

72
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,200
the food chain to continue the story.

73
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,879
Abna was so taken aback by the loss of know-how

74
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,560
about Ghana's traditional recipes and ingredients

75
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,800
in the towns and cities that she decided she had to do something

76
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,000
and set off to rural areas on a fact-finding tool.

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,280
We traveled across the Upper East,

78
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,480
reaching in Ghana just to document indigenous dishes

79
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,960
and to ask, what are people eating now

80
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,640
and learning that a lot of dishes are lost?

81
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:20,439
Abna was taken aback by the changes in Ghana's food culture.

82
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:23,240
She felt shocked and surprised.

83
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,680
Traditionally, recipes were passed down orally

84
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,479
from mother to daughter instead of being written down,

85
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,680
so a generation of young Ghanaians

86
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,199
were losing cooking know-how,

87
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,719
the practical skills and knowledge of how to do something.

88
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:42,680
Abna traveled around Ghana to document traditional recipes

89
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,159
to record information about them

90
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,720
by writing them down or taking photos

91
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,680
before they were lost forever.

92
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,280
If a story has inspired you to find out

93
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,000
about your own country's traditional recipes

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,640
or discover more about Ghanaian cooking,

95
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,080
you can read more on Abna's website,

96
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,120
living the ancestral way.

97
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,920
And after all this talk of traditional Ghanaian food,

98
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,040
it's time for your question about a traditional British recipe,

99
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,480
bangers a mash or sausage and mashed potato.

100
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,080
Now you asked me about the name Banger,

101
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,640
and I guess that bang was an old fashioned word for pork.

102
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,040
So was I right?

103
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,520
You were wrong, I'm afraid, Rob.

104
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,680
The name Banger started in World War I

105
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,480
when meat shortages resulted in sausages being made

106
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:34,480
using water that caused them to explode going bang when cooked.

107
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,240
Well, that's certainly one way to spice up your cooking.

108
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,960
Okay, let's recap the rest of the vocabulary

109
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:43,279
starting with mortar and pestle,

110
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,079
a bowl and a heavy stone,

111
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,439
which is used to grind ingredients together.

112
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,479
To pound something means to crush it into a paste or powder.

113
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:55,279
If you're taken aback, you feel shocked and surprised.

114
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,399
Know how is the practical skill and knowledge

115
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,799
needed to do something such as cook?

116
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:04,079
And finally, the verb document means to record information

117
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,959
about something by writing about it or taking photos.

118
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,199
Once again, our six minutes are up.

119
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,039
Bye for now.

120
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:11,879
Bye.

121
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,719
Six minute English from the BBC.
