6-Mute English from BBCLearningEnglish.com

00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,919
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Phil.

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,120
And I'm Beth. Are you a big reader Phil?

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,359
Sure, I enjoy reading and it's also a great way to pass the time on my daily commute to work.

5
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,960
But reading isn't just a nice thing to do. It's an essential skill, something you need for

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,719
everyday activities, whether that's finding out the news by reading a newspaper or by

7
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,960
groceries by reading the labels. And that's why I was shocked by a recent UN report

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:46,560
estimating that around the world over 700 million adults are illiterate, which means they can't

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:53,120
read or write. Wow, that's a huge number of people excluded from doing basic day-to-day things.

10
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:59,359
So what can be done to get more adults reading and writing? In this program we'll be hearing

11
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,759
about projects into very different countries trying to do just that. And as usual, we'll be learning

12
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:13,599
some useful new vocabulary as well. But first I have a question for you Phil. I mentioned a recent UN

13
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:20,560
report on the high numbers of people unable to read and write, but illiteracy is not a new problem.

14
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,640
Since 1967, the UN has been highlighting the importance of literacy, being able to read and write,

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,359
with a day of celebration called International Literacy Day. But when does it take place?

16
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:43,040
Is it a, the 8th of March, b, the 8th of June, or c, the 8th of September?

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,320
I think International Literacy Day is on the 8th of September.

18
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,319
Okay Phil, we'll find out if that's correct at the end of the program.

19
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:59,039
The biggest reason people grow up illiterate is not going to school, and that's especially

20
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:05,199
true for people living in the coastal towns of Bangladesh. Because these towns flood regularly,

21
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:10,719
families are always on the move, making it hard for children to get an education.

22
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,519
The Friendship Project teaches reading and writing to groups of Bangladesh-y women and girls.

23
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:21,840
They also teach numeracy, which means the ability to do basic maths like counting and adding up.

24
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,480
Here, one student Rashida explains the impact it's had on her to BBC World Service program,

25
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,840
people fixing the world.

26
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,840
My parents never sent me to school and I've suffered from not being able to read and write.

27
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,920
My children were embarrassed that I was illiterate. I couldn't even do basic accounting.

28
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,599
Until now, I've had to use my fingerprint as a signature as I was illiterate.

29
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,039
But now I can sign my name because I can read and write the alphabet,

30
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,599
and I'll also be able to keep an account of my expenses. No one can cheat me anymore.

31
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,639
Before the Friendship Project, Rashida couldn't write her signature, her name written in her

32
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,799
own handwriting. Instead, she had to use her fingerprint.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,959
Now Rashida has learnt the alphabet and also some basic maths, so she knows how much money she

34
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:24,959
spent and how much she has left. This means no one can cheat her, can trick or swindle her into

35
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,839
taking her money. The Friendship Project is free and so far over 11,000 adults have completed it,

36
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,759
but it's not just developing countries that struggle with literacy. Our second project takes

37
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:44,080
place much closer to home, the north of England, where charity read easy, matches adult learners

38
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:51,759
with trained volunteers for one-to-one lessons. In the UK, one-in-six adults struggle with reading

39
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:59,599
and writing, including Peter. Peter had hearing problems as a child, fell behind at school and

40
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:06,319
never learnt to read. Here he is, talking with BBC World Service Programme, people fixing the world.

41
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,840
Everyone takes for granted that you just open a letter and you read it. Before I met my wife,

42
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,680
I used to have to knock on the neighbours door, could you read this from me? Can you imagine the

43
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:25,360
embarrassment? I've tried college twice, nothing works, so as far as I'm concerned, I think I'm stupid.

44
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:31,040
I'm just one of those people, it's never going to work for me, and that was my life.

45
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:38,960
Many of us take it for granted that everyone can read and write. If you take something for granted,

46
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,199
you assume it's true without checking. Peter had to ask his neighbours to read his letters,

47
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,879
something he found very embarrassing. He thought he was thick, stupid and unintelligent.

48
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:59,120
Now, Peter says learning with Rudezy has changed his life, his literate and is reading his way

49
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,959
through the Harry Potter books, and he always celebrates International Literacy Day.

50
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:11,120
Which reminds me of your question, Beth. When does the UN's International Literacy Day take place?

51
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,360
I said it was on the 8th of September. And that was the correct answer.

52
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt from this programme, starting with

53
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,720
illiterate, meaning unable to read and write.

54
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,639
Numeracy is the ability to understand basic maths, count and add up.

55
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,480
Your signature is your name written in your own handwriting style. It shows that something has

56
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:43,120
been written or agreed by you. To cheat someone means to trick or deceive them in order to get

57
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,040
their money more valuables. If you take something for granted, you assume that it's true without

58
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:55,120
checking up. And finally, the adjective thick is an informal word for stupid. Once again,

59
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,120
our six minutes are up. But remember to join us again next time for more trending topics and

60
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,280
useful vocabulary. Here at 6 Minute English. Goodbye for now. Bye.
