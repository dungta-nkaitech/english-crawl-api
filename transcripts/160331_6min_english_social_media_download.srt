00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,280
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Sophie.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,359
Neil?

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,320
Neil?

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,240
Oh, sorry. And I'm Neil.

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,560
Neil, please put down your phone. We're doing the show.

10
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:34,079
Yeah, I know. Hang on a minute. I just need to tweet something and...

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:34,719
Done.

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,239
And the subject to today's show is social media and it's impact on our daily lives.

13
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,399
Ah, well, I suppose it has had quite a big impact on mine.

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,920
That's all too clear. Now, perhaps we can move on to today's quiz question.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,000
Of course. I'm all ears. Oh, hang on. Wait a second.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,280
There's a word to describe what you're doing, you know. Answer me this.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,800
Which word describes a situation where you're talking to someone and they suddenly look down

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:10,640
at their phone or answer it? Is it a, fobbing, b, fibbing, or c, fubbing?

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,879
Well, you've got me there, Sophie. I have no idea, but I'll guess that it's c, fubbing.

20
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,520
Well, we'll find out later on in the show whether you've got the answer right or not.

21
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,359
Now, let's move on and talk about phone etiquette.

22
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:31,840
etiquette means rules of polite behaviour in society or among people in a certain group.

23
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,599
Well, interrupting conversations to check your phone has become a social norm, hasn't it, Sophie?

24
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:43,280
Social norms are the rules of behaviour considered acceptable in a group or society.

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,719
I don't agree, Neil. Let's listen to Professor Sherry Terkel of the Massachusetts

26
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,200
Institute of Technology talking about social norms amongst students.

27
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,640
I interviewed hundreds of college students and what they talked about was what some of them

28
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,280
called the rule of three and what the rule of three is, which is that if you go to dinner with

29
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,560
friends, you don't want to look down at your phone until you see that three people, let's say,

30
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,280
your six at dinner, are looking up in the conversation. So there's a new etiquette where you don't

31
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,640
look down unless three people are looking up kind of to keep the little conversation alive.

32
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,199
Professor Sherry Terkel, why don't you try out the rule of three once in a while?

33
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,520
There are only two of us here, Sophie, do the math and I'm listening to you.

34
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,080
Let me just send a text message there here on my phone. Hang on.

35
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:49,040
Neil. Neil, I'm not going to carry on with the show unless you pay attention.

36
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,480
Sorry Sophie, actually I was just doing that to wind you up. I wasn't really using my phone, sorry.

37
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,240
And to wind someone up means to say or do something deliberately in order to annoy someone.

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,520
Well, I do get wind up about people constantly checking their devices.

39
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,560
Yesterday, I was in a cafe and two girls came in. They sat down and started chatting away.

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,360
But not to each other, they were tapping away on their devices. And there was no face-to-face

41
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,960
conversation at all. But you can have moments of connection using your devices, you know.

42
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,120
If you have a connection with someone, you engage emotionally. Exactly. I was on the train this

43
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,560
morning and there were a couple sharing a tablet. They were looking at the screen and talking about

44
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,560
what they saw there. It was very intimate and they were well, very connected. Let's hear from

45
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,319
Ian Sinclair, British poet and filmmaker, talking about a new generation of connected humans.

46
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,759
Physiologically, we're changing. That almost the neck muscles are tipped over.

47
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,240
They look down. We're getting a new kind of human being and I think maybe I'm not getting it,

48
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,800
that there is actually a different kind of intimacy emerging in which these instruments are very

49
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:11,760
important. So, Ian Sinclair says our physiology is changing. Our bodies, our neck muscles are changing,

50
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,920
to make it easier to look down all the time at our devices. But it isn't only muscles that might

51
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:24,879
change as a result of our techie habits. It's the way we interact or engage with each other too.

52
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:31,759
Ian Sinclair talks about a different kind of intimacy emerging. What does he mean, Neil?

53
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,920
Our intimacy or closeness with other people is somehow connected up with our devices.

54
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:44,240
They've become part of us and I expect someday devices will literally be part of us and implant

55
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,279
in our neck or something. Oh, what a horrible thought. Let's have the quiz question again,

56
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:56,399
Sophie, to take your mind off it. Okay. I asked, which word describes a situation where you are

57
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:02,559
talking to someone and they suddenly look down at their phone or answer it? Is it A, fobbing,

58
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:12,159
B, fibbing or C, fobbing? And I said C, fobbing. You were right, Neil. Well done. It's a combination

59
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:19,360
of phone and snubbing. Snub means to deliberately ignore someone you know. New words formed by

60
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,480
putting together parts of existing words are known as blends or portmante words. And fobbing is

61
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,760
starting to appear in some online dictionaries. Now, can we hear the words we learnt today, Neil?

62
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:43,360
Neil? Okay, I'll say the words myself. Etiquette. Wind someone up. Have a connection with someone.

63
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:54,000
Physiology. Interact. Intimacy. Snub. Well, that's the end of today's six minute English.

64
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,480
Don't forget to connect with us again soon. Come on, Neil. Connect with us. Come on.

65
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,640
Oh yeah, hang on. Just got to, uh, goodbye. Hang on. I'll be with you in a second.

66
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,439
Yes. Okay. Bye.
