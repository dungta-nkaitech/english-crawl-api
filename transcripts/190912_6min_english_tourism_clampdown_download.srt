00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,359
Hello, this is 6 Minute English and I'm Rob.

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,280
This is the programme where in just 6 minutes we discuss an interesting topic

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,920
and teach some related English vocabulary.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,080
Well, joining me to do this is Sam.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,519
Hello. So what's our interesting topic today, Rob?

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,800
Something close to our heart, Sam. It's travel.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,000
Ah, great.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,679
But more and more of us are travelling to explore the world.

13
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,320
Many of us have more leisure time and the cost of travelling has become relatively cheaper.

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,240
But here lies the problem.

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,359
The places we're visiting are becoming more crowded,

16
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,320
sometimes spoiling the atmosphere and the beauty.

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,799
The things we came to see in the first place.

18
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,799
This is why we're going to be discussing how some cities around the world

19
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:57,679
are putting restrictions on the tourists who visit.

20
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,000
But that's after I challenge you to answer this question, Sam. Are you ready?

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,280
Bring it on, Rob.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,519
According to MasterCards Global Destination Cities Index,

23
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,239
what was the most visited city in 2018?

24
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:12,479
Was it a London,

25
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,200
B New York or C Bangkok?

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,359
All great places to visit.

27
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,319
But I think I'll stay close to home and say,

28
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,599
A London.

29
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:25,519
Okay, well, as always, I will reveal the answer later in the programme.

30
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,399
Now let's start our journey in Italy's capital city, Rome,

31
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:31,919
famous for its colosseum,

32
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:34,399
Trevi found in, and many other things.

33
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:41,039
Lots of people are visiting Rob and locals and tourists have differing attitudes towards the way they respect

34
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:43,039
these beautiful and historic sites.

35
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,919
Respect here is a verb to mean treat something with care.

36
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,240
Well, the authorities in the city fear that some tourists are showing disrespect to the city

37
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,079
and have introduced laws to clamp down on certain behaviour.

38
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,240
Clamp down means officially trying to stop or limit people doing something.

39
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,159
Sabina Castell Franco is a journalist in the city.

40
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,920
She told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme why new restrictions have been introduced.

41
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,360
The new rules are really to make sure that tourists do not misbehave

42
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,040
when they are visiting tourist attractions in Rome.

43
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,800
Romances don't like to see tourists walking around,

44
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,040
they're chestered, they don't like to see them waiting in their fountains.

45
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,240
So really the objective is to improve the life of the city for residents and for tourists themselves.

46
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,680
So the new rules are to stop tourists' misbehaving.

47
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,480
That's doing bad or inappropriate things.

48
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,200
I'm sure not all visitors misbehave,

49
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,919
but those who have been, have been waiting.

50
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:58,000
That's walking through water in the famous fountains and men have not been covering up the top half of their bodies.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,399
So going bare-chested.

52
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:02,000
Not any more, Sam.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,560
These new laws have banned this with the objective of improving the life for the people of Rome, the Romans.

54
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,679
An objective is a plan or aim to achieve something.

55
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:16,399
Other laws introduced in Rome with the objective of improving the city

56
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,240
include giving out severe fines to people who drop litter

57
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,040
and to those who attach love padlocks to historic monuments.

58
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,640
Well, I guess if it makes the city a nicer place to visit for everyone, then it's a good idea.

59
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,680
Well, let's talk about another historic old city,

60
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,360
Bruges in Belgium.

61
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,719
The old and narrow streets are often packed with sightseers,

62
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,879
so restrictions have been introduced there.

63
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,040
Helen Coffey, Deputy Travel Editor for the Independent Newspaper,

64
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,879
also spoke to the UNIORS programme to explain what is going on.

65
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,799
Bruges was the latest city to say we're going to introduce new regulations to crack down on.

66
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,199
What they call the disnification of their city.

67
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,439
A really key one is they're going to cap the number of cruises that can dock.

68
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,799
And actually, this is a big one that lots of cities do.

69
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,000
They basically don't like cruise visitors because cruise visitors don't spend money.

70
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:19,360
So Helen mentioned a crack down, which like clamp down means taking action to restrict or stop certain

71
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:25,920
activities. And Bruges wants to crack down on the disnification of the city.

72
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:32,319
Hmm, this term describes turning something into an artificial, not real, commercial environment,

73
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,319
similar to a Walt Disney theme park. I'm not sure it's that similar yet,

74
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:42,319
but one way to maintain the authentic feel of the city is to cap the number of cruises that can dock.

75
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,199
Cap means restrict or limit.

76
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,279
It's felt that visitors who come by cruise ship don't stay overnight and therefore don't bring

77
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:58,159
much money into the city. The message from the city authorities is stay overnight or don't come.

78
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,319
Well, one city that has people visiting for the day or staying longer is the most visited city

79
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:11,839
in the world. But where is that Sam? Earlier, I asked you what the most visited city in 2018 was.

80
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:17,920
Was it a London, be New York or C Bangkok? And I said London.

81
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,000
That was in second place. The most visited city last year was Bangkok in Thailand.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,600
Okay Rob, well, maybe what I can get right is a recap of today's vocabulary. Starting with respect.

83
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,280
If you respect something, you treat it with care. We also discussed clamp down, which means

84
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,400
officially trying to stop or limit people doing something. Crack down is a similar phrase.

85
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:50,080
To misbehave is to do something bad or inappropriate. And an objective is a plan or aim to achieve

86
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,160
something. Our next word is disnification. A term that describes turning something into an artificial,

87
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,560
not real, commercial environment, similar to a Walt Disney theme park. And finally, we had cap,

88
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:09,120
which means restrict or limit. Well, we've had to cap this programme at six minutes and we're out of time.

89
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,320
Goodbye. Bye-bye.
