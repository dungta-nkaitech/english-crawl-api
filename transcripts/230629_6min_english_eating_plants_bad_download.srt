Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And I'm Rob.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Many people these days choose not to eat meat,

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and for vegetarians eating animals is wrong.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But what about digging up a carrot or picking apples from a tree? Is that wrong too?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't think so, Neil. Plants aren't alive in the same way as animals, are they?

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
They can't think or feel pain, and even vegetarians need to eat something.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Fruit, vegetables, rice beans, they all come from plants.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's true that plants don't have brains or nerves,

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
but according to some scientists, they're much more than passive things rooted in the ground.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Plants can learn and remember, they solve problems, and can even recognise other plants in their family.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So, given the amazing things plants do, is it right to eat them?

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That's what we'll be discussing in this programme.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And as usual, we'll be learning some new useful vocabulary as well.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But first, I have a question for you, Neil.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Anyone who's seen cows grazing knows it's usually animals that eat plants.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But some plants have turned the evolutionary tables to eat animals instead.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So, which tropical plant is famous for trapping insects to eat?

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Is it A, the corpse flower, B, the American skunk cabbage, or C, the Venus fly trap?

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I think it's C, the Venus fly trap.

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Ok, Neil, we'll find out if that's the right answer later in the programme.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Plants have been on the planet for hundreds of millions of years longer than humans

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and have used that time to evolve special skills.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Here's Professor Rick Carbon, a biologist at the University of California,

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
explaining more to James Wong, botanist and presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, is eating plants wrong.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Without eyes, plants can perceive a lot of information about light.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Without noses, plants can perceive chemical information.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Without ears, plants can perceive sounds.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And so, we've come to realise that plants are very perceptive about what's going on in their environments.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You could argue, for example, that plants can perceive most of the senses that humans can.

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I would agree with that, and then some.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What do you mean, and then some?

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Anyone who's had a dog knows that dogs have a much keener sense of smell than humans do.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And we're now learning that plants are very responsive to chemicals in their environment.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Even without ears, eyes or a nose, plants are very perceptive.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
They notice things around them.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
In fact, Professor Carbon says that plants perceive as much as humans and then some,

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
an idiom meaning and even more, which is used to emphasise that what you mentioned before was an understatement.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
For example, Bill Gates is rich.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And then some.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Like dogs, plants have a keen sense of smell, which they use to detect chemicals in the air.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Here, keen means powerful and intense.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Okay, so plants can see light and smell the air, but does that mean they're intelligent?

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Maybe so.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Studies modelled on the famous Pavlov's dog experiment have trained pea seedlings to find the quickest route to light through a maze,

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
and remember it, evidence of memory.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
In another experiment, potted plants were lined up with routes joining them like a chain of people holding hands.

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The plants talk to each other, passing a long information about water and air temperature through their routes.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Like children playing a game where a message is passed on in a whisper through a chain of people becoming distorted in the process,

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
distorted means changed from its original form.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
All this takes brain power, and there's clearly evidence that plants might have some kind of intelligence.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So given all of this, is it wrong to eat them?

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That's what James Wong asked Michael Marder, professor of philosophy at the University of the Bass Country,

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
for his BBC Radio 4 program is eating plants wrong.

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Is it wrong to eat plants?

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It is not in of itself wrong to eat plants, but we have to do so while keeping in mind the context in which we're doing this.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We have to first of all think about what kinds of plants we're eating, what are the parts of those plants?

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Are we in fact destroying the entire living being, or just taking certain of its parts such as fruits and leaves

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
that are not essential to it that can actually fall off without doing harm to the whole organism?

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Professor Marder says that eating plants is not wrong in and of itself, when considered alone without taking anything else into account.

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But he thinks it's important to remember the context, the situation or circumstances in which something happens.

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Picking an apple, for example, is okay because it doesn't kill the tree itself, which can go on to produce more fruit.

64
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It seems plants really are clever, but do they know the answer to your question, Rob?

65
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yes, I asked you to name the famous insect eating tropical plant.

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And I said it was the Venus flytrap.

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Which was the correct answer, well done Neil.

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned, starting with the adjective perceptive.

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Quick to notice and understand things.

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The idiom and then some means and even more, and is used to show that something has been understated.

71
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
A keen sense of smell, sight or hearing is powerful and intense.

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Distorted means changed from its original form.

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The phrase in and of itself means when considered alone without taking anything else into account.

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And finally, the context is the general situation in which something happens.

75
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye.

76
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Goodbye.
