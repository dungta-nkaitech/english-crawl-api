00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
6 minutes English from the BBC.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:11,160
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,800
And I'm Beth. Have you ever had a horrible boss, not been paid enough or simply got tired

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:24,280
of doing the same old boring jobs? I love presenting 6 Minute English, of course, but

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,879
some of my previous jobs have been pretty awful, Neil. When I waitressed in cafes, I was

6
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:33,839
on my feet 10 hours a day. It was exhausting.

7
00:00:33,839 --> 00:00:39,560
Most people have had bad work experiences at one time or another. Maybe a job that was

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:46,079
boring, badly paid, or just working too much and getting burned out, lacking energy or

9
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,320
enthusiasm because of working too hard.

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,399
But does it have to be like this? Since most of our waking day is spent at work, how can

11
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,640
we make sure our job doesn't make us unhappy? That's what we'll be discussing in this

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,759
programme and, as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

13
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:12,319
Sounds good, Beth, but first I have a question for you. The worst job I ever had was the summer

14
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:19,280
I spent working as a portable toilet cleaner at Music festivals. But according to a recent

15
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:26,960
survey by Forbes magazine, what was voted the worst job in the UK? Was it A, a call centre

16
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,000
worker, B, a bartender or C, a traffic warden?

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,560
I think the answer might be a call centre worker.

18
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,439
Okay, Beth, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

19
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:45,040
Now it's interesting that survey was carried out in the UK because being unhappy at work

20
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:52,040
could be related to the British working culture, which emphasises working at a fast pace.

21
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,120
Here's Damian Grimshaw, a professor of employment studies at King's College London, speaking

22
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,240
with BBC Radio 4 programme Analysis.

23
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:07,440
Really it's all about pace, cost efficiencies, meeting targets, deadlines. So this is why

24
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,640
when people do surveys of what we call work intensity, right? So how hard you work,

25
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,759
are you driven on pace? Is there a supervisor breathing down your neck? We score really badly

26
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:19,039
compared to European countries.

27
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:25,359
Compared to some European countries, British workers have to meet more targets and deadlines,

28
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:29,359
a time or date by which a particular job must be finished.

29
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:34,919
The pressure to work quickly means you might have your boss breathing down your neck, an

30
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:40,599
idiom meaning that someone is watching you very closely and checking everything you do,

31
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:47,599
what a nice feeling to have at work. That's right, a good job is about more than pay and conditions.

32
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:53,919
It's one that uses your talents and gives you some choice over how and when you work.

33
00:02:53,919 --> 00:03:00,840
In 2022, Britain's biggest employer, the National Health Service or NHS, lost more than

34
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:08,359
15,000 nurses, many quitting because of the long and inflexible working hours.

35
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,880
Another sector with long working hours is the construction industry, low paid, dirty

36
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:21,440
and physically demanding construction workers also risk high levels of work related injury.

37
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,120
Here Emma Stewart, co-founder of Social Business Time-wise, tells BBC Radio 4 programme analysis

38
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,800
about her trial project to help builders enjoy their jobs more.

39
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,840
In the work that we've done within the construction industry, we have trialled what we would

40
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,920
call an output-based way of working, which means we shift away from the sense of presentism,

41
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,680
the sense of you are paid by the day, you are on site from 7 in the morning until the

42
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,840
last person needs maybe 7 in the evening, to a task-based way of working, which means

43
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,960
you are going to do five tasks over the course of this day. When you've done those tasks

44
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,439
and you've done them well, you can go home, but we will still pay you the same amount for the day.

45
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:07,240
We were able to deliver the projects that we worked on with them on time on budget, but

46
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,639
critically the feedback from workers was that work-life balance schools doubled and they

47
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,599
were able to reduce the amount of overtime that they did. It's a win-win.

48
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:22,519
Emma describes the current working patterns using the word presentism, staying at work longer

49
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:28,120
than usual or going to work when you're ill to show that you work hard, but this isn't an

50
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:35,160
effective way to work. Emma thinks a task-based approach is better, both at getting the job done

51
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,840
and for improving work-life balance. The amount of time you spend at work, compared with the

52
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,680
amount of time you spend relaxing with your family and doing things you enjoy. In other words,

53
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,040
flexible working is a win-win, a situation that's good for everyone involved.

54
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:57,720
Maybe more flexible working would help some of the jobs I mentioned earlier in my question, Beth,

55
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:04,040
according to a recent Forbes magazine survey, what was voted the worst job in the UK?

56
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,319
I guess it was a job I've done myself working in a call centre.

57
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:15,160
That was the correct answer, although I think my summer job cleaning toilets was even worse.

58
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,240
Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this programme starting with burnout.

59
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,560
Lack of energy or enthusiasm because of working too hard. A deadline is the time by which a

60
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:33,560
particular job must be done. If someone is breathing down your neck, they're watching you very

61
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:40,280
closely and checking everything you do. Presentism means staying at work longer than usual to show your

62
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,879
employer that you work hard and are important to them. Work-life balance is the amount of time you

63
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:50,759
spend doing your job, compared with the amount of time you spend doing things you enjoy.

64
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,160
And finally, a win-win is a situation or result that is good for everyone.

65
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:03,319
Once again, our six minutes are up. Join us again next time, but for now, get back to work.

66
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:04,600
Goodbye!
