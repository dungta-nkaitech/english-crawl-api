6-Mute English from BBCLearningEnglish.com

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,599
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Pippa.

3
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:11,800
And I'm Neil.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,000
Now, Neil, have you ever wanted to be a musician?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,400
Oh, yes, Pippa. I still want to be a musician.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,199
I've been playing my guitar since I was 14.

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,000
Wow. Well, maybe one day you'll manage it.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Who knows? What about you?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,800
I don't think I'd like to be a musician.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,000
I think it would be a bit stressful, especially if you had lots of fans and more really successful.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hmm, yeah. I wonder what life as a musician is actually like.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,799
We'll be finding that out in this programme as we hear from some people around the UK

13
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:44,799
who would like to become successful musicians.

14
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:48,000
And we'll even listen to some of their music too.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But first, I have a question for you, Neil.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,799
In the UK, we have a weekly chart of the best selling songs in the country.

17
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:58,799
And the top selling song is called the number one.

18
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:04,799
But which musical artist do you think has had the most UK number one songs?

19
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,799
Is it A, the Beatles, B, Ed Sheeran or C, Elvis Presley?

20
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,799
Oh, well, I think that's easy. It must be surely the Beatles.

21
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,599
Well, I'll reveal the answer at the end of the programme.

22
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:25,000
Now, getting a number one song is a dream for many musicians.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,599
But if you want to become a musician, where do you start?

24
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:31,599
I grew up in a really rich music scene in St Ives.

25
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,599
I was going to open mics from the age of about 11.

26
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,799
This is Bailey. She lives in St Ives in Cornwall on the southwest coast of England.

27
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,799
She says she was going to open mic nights from a young age.

28
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,000
Open mic nights are events where anyone can sing or play music.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Bailey talked about her life as a musician to BBC Learning English programme, My Song My Home.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I would go to these songwriter circles at the Ketlenwink on a Friday night after school,

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
where I'd be the youngest person by like 50 years,

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
but I'd sit in a circle of a bunch of old men,

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and they'd play James Taylor and Carol King and the Eagles,

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and lots of 70s music, and I guess that's influenced me massively.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But I guess, you know, everyone kind of took me under the wing growing up.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
When she was younger, Bailey went to songwriter circles.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
These are meetings for people interested in writing their own music.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Bailey remembers sitting with a bunch of old men.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
A bunch is an informal way to talk about a group of people.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The older men in the group would play music from the 1970s,

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and Bailey says they took her under their wing.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If you take somebody under your wing, you decide to protect them or guide them.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Let's meet another musician, Josh.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So I learnt my first proper song on guitar when I was about 13.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I literally started busking the moment I could kind of do that.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Josh lives in London and is a busker.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This means that he performs on the street or in public places to earn money.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Busking is a common way for musicians to make money and perform to more people,

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and as Josh told BBC Learning English programme, my song, my home,

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
it can help musicians to get new opportunities.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's been kind of like my main earner.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This kept me going for the last ten or so years.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
From that it's then got me various different opportunities.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's got me all my gigs, got me all my connections.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So I owe a lot to the busking.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Busking is Josh's main earner.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's his main source of money.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He says that busking has got him all his gigs and connections.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Gigs are musical concerts and it's an informal slang word.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Josh says he owes a lot to busking.

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
If you owe a lot to someone or something, you have success or happiness because of that personal thing.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So would you like to listen to some of Josh's music, Neil?

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Of course I would.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Well, here's a bit of his song, That Side of the Wall,

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
which he performed for BBC Learning English programme, my song, my home.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Wow, Josh is pretty good, isn't he?

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'd love to hear more.

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, you can find performances by the musicians in the series on our website,

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
BBCLearningEnglish.com, and we'll also put a link in the notes below this episode.

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
OK, so what about your question, Pipper?

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes, I asked which artist had the most number one songs in the UK charts?

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The Beatles, Ed Sheeran or Elvis?

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And you said the Beatles, Neil.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But the answer is actually Elvis Presley.

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He's had 21 number one songs and the Beatles have had 18.

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Really? Well, that's OK, I love the King as well.

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this musical episode,

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
starting with open mic nights, events where anyone can sing or play music.

79
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Songwriter circles, you can find a lot of different things in the series.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Songwriter circles are meetings for people interested in writing their own music.

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
A bunch of people is a group of people.

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The expression takes someone under your wing, means to protect or guide someone.

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Basking is performing in a public place for money, and a busker is someone who performs on the street for money.

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Your main earner is your main source of income.

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Gigs are musical concerts.

86
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And the expression to owe a lot to someone or something, means to have success or happiness because of that personal thing.

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Once again, our six minutes are up that you can find my song, My Home, on our website,

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
BBCLearningEnglish.com.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Watch the songs and sing along and learn more about the vocabulary in the lyrics.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We'll see you again soon for some more trending topics and useful vocabulary.

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Bye for now.

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Goodbye.
