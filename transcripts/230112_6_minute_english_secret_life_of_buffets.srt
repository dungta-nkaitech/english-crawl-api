00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,439
And I'm Sam. Have you ever been to an all-you-can-eat buffet, Sam?

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:14,240
You know, a meal in a restaurant where you can eat as much food as you like.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes, I went to an Indian buffet once. I didn't eat all day before the meal,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,199
but I only managed to finish three or four plates. Well, maybe five.

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,839
It sounds like your eyes were bigger than your belly or stomach,

7
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,159
a phrase describing someone who has taken more food than they can eat.

8
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,240
In this programme, we'll be discussing buffets, a feast of many different food dishes

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,519
where diners are allowed to eat as much as they want,

10
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:49,920
or as much as their stomachs will allow. And of course, we'll be learning some new vocabulary as well.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,160
The popularity of buffets is booming, especially in Middle Eastern and Asian countries where the

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,480
variety of foods means there's something for everyone. But feasts are big and boastful.

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,040
Usually too much is cooked, and buffets have been criticised for waste.

14
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,960
We'll hear more soon, but first I have a question for you, Sam.

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,480
The word buffet originated from the French name for the table on which food was served,

16
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:23,680
but buffets themselves don't come from France. So, in which country did buffets begin?

17
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,800
Was it A, the United States of America, B, Sweden or C, China?

18
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,960
Well, the US is famous for super-sizing food, so I guess A, America.

19
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,080
Okay, Sam, we'll find out the answer later in the programme.

20
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,080
John Wood, owner of Cooking Company Kitchen Cut, knows a lot about buffets.

21
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,439
He used to run a 1000 seat breakfast buffet at the five star Jumeirer Beach Hotel in Dubai.

22
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:58,560
Here John shares his observations on human buffet behaviour with BBC World Service programme,

23
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,679
the food chain.

24
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:05,519
There are different people that treat buffets in different ways. Some people think this is a great

25
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:11,039
opportunity to try little bits and lots of everything can come back many times I like.

26
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,439
And other people just, whether they don't get it up and down, which is understandable,

27
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:20,319
from their table just want to pile it high and people want to get value for money.

28
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,039
So, if you're paying $100, $200 ahead for a buffet, you're going to pile it up high and take

29
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,919
the most expensive things you can and get your money's worth.

30
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:34,479
John says buffet diners want to get their money's worth, get good value for the money they spend,

31
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:40,159
so they often pile up food on their plate. If you pile something up,

32
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:45,759
you gather a large amount of it into one place to build what's called a pile.

33
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:52,560
But buffets are not just about eating until you explode. They're also an opportunity to show off

34
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,879
to your friends. Weddings are big in India and usually include a buffet, the richer the people

35
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,960
getting married, the bigger the buffet. Sometimes inviting as many as 5,000 guests.

36
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,560
If each guest eats around 6 dishes, we're talking about a seriously big buffet.

37
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,000
Sandeep Sturan is a wedding caterer in Goa in South India. He owns a company which provides

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,439
the food and drink for special social occasions. Here he talks with Ruth Alexander,

39
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:29,120
presenter of BBC World Service, the Food Programme, about organising an Indian wedding buffet.

40
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:37,280
It's a very vicious circle I think. Everybody wants to owe him everybody around you.

41
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:45,039
Okay, that's the aim. They are out to impress. They want to wow the guests, knock their socks off.

42
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,520
Knocks the socks off. They should just go back saying, I couldn't eat even half of it.

43
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:59,760
Some people just come for eating. They don't even worry about who's wedding it is and things

44
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,400
that they know that who's a caterer. These guys are catering. Oh my god, this is going to be great.

45
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,120
Wedding buffets are designed to amaze and overwhelm the guests with a huge display of food.

46
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:19,519
They need to wow the guests or knock their socks off. An idiom meaning to amaze and impress someone.

47
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,839
The problem is that no matter how extravagant and expensive one buffet is, the next one has to be

48
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:32,399
even more impressive. Something Sandeep calls a vicious circle. A difficult situation which has

49
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,839
the effect of creating new problems which then make the original situation even worse.

50
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:44,799
It seems the secret to enjoying a buffet is trying a little bit of everything without stuffing

51
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,079
yourself until you can't move. Although in the past, I think that was exactly the idea.

52
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:56,800
Hmm, okay. It's time to reveal the answer to my question. Where did the buffet originally come from?

53
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:05,360
I guessed it was from the United States. Was I right? That was the wrong answer. I'm afraid Sam.

54
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,600
In fact, buffets are thought to have come from Sweden in the Middle Ages.

55
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,960
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned starting with the expression

56
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,360
eyes bigger than your belly or eyes bigger than your stomach. Used when someone has taken more food

57
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,160
than they can eat. If you pile up your plate, you gather a large quantity of food together into a pile.

58
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:34,320
The phrase to get your money's worth means to get good value for the money you have spent.

59
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:40,560
A vicious circle is a problematic situation having the effect of creating new problems which

60
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:48,000
then make the first situation even worse. The idiom to knock your socks off means to wow a maze

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,639
or impress someone. And finally, a caterer is a person or company which provides food and drink

62
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,920
for special social occasions. Once again, our six minutes are up. Bye for now. Bye-bye.
