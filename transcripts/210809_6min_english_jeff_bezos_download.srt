3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And I'm Georgina.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If you've ever done shopping online, then you may well have used the Internet giant Amazon.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
From its origins as an online bookstore, Amazon has grown into grocery deliveries,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
TV and music streaming and even space exploration.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Making its founder Jeff Bezos the richest person on earth.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Amazon is so successful it affects how many of us live our lives.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So in this program we'll be taking a look inside the brain of Jeff Bezos to find out how he thinks.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
When Jeff Bezos' friends talk about him three words they often use are

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
invention, risk-taking and long-term vision.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
These are qualities which Bezos admired in his grandfather Lawrence,

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
who from an early age taught Jeff that by careful thinking any problem can be solved.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
As a boy, Jeff and his grandfather repaired an old broken-down truck.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
When interviewed today, Bezos sometimes compares Amazon to that truck.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Very heavy but impossible to stop when it rolls downhill.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Which is exactly what accidentally happened one day.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But do you know how the story ends Georgina? That's my quiz question.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What happened when the young Jeff Bezos' car accidentally rolled downhill?

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Was it A? Jeff jumped in and pulled the handbrake?

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
B? Jeff's granddad lost the thumb?

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Or C? Jeff's hair fell out.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Well, Jeff Bezos is bored so maybe it's C? His hair fell out.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay Georgina, we'll find out later.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
As a company Amazon has been remarkably strong.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It survived the dot-com crash of 2000 and saw profits jump during the COVID pandemic.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
As more and more people started shopping online.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Retail analyst Natalie Berg thinks Amazon's success is due to its customer strategy.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
As she explains to BBC Radio 4 program seriously.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Jeff Bezos applied this concept to Amazon by relentlessly focusing on customers,

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
by putting them at the heart of the business, that that would attract more customers,

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
more traffic to its site, which would in turn attract more sellers,

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
which would mean a greater selection for customers,

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
which again would enhance the customer experience.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Natalie thinks that Amazon put customers at the heart of their business.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
In other words, they make customers the most important part.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This improves Amazon's customer experience,

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
a customer's total perception of their experience with a business,

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
including such things as the quality of service

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
and support if something goes wrong.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Customers can write reviews on Amazon's website,

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and happy customers means more web traffic,

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
the number of people visiting a particular website.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
In the difficult years following the dot-com crash,

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Jeff Bezos started Marketplace,

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
where other sellers compete with Amazon's own products.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
More sellers brought more customers,

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
which in turn brought down prices.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Then in 2013, Bezos bought the Washington Post.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And in 2019, he launched his space exploration company Blue Origin

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
to explore mineral resources on Mars.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Most recently, Jeff Bezos has set his sights on even bigger things,

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
saving the future of the planet.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Bezos chose Tom Rivet-Karnack of the Environmental Group Global Optimism

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
to help Amazon meet climate initiative goals aimed at slowing climate change.

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Here is Tom Rivet-Karnack, telling David Baker,

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
presenter of BBC Radio 4s seriously,

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
about his conversation with Jeff Bezos.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It did seem to me that it was a legacy issue for him

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
that he wanted to be on the right side of history.

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And you don't think it's just greenwashing in the end.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
How do you define that?

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I mean, would you define greenwashing if you said somebody got into this issue

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
because they wanted to improve a reputation of a company or an individual?

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Actually, that's fine, right?

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
As long as they do something meaningful and deliver a major outcome.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Protecting the planet is what Jeff Bezos wants to be part of his legacy,

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
the achievements of his life that will continue after he dies.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
In other words, Bezos wants to be on the right side of history,

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
judged to have acted correctly or morally by future generations.

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Ultimately though, it's real action on climate change that counts,

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
not just greenwashing.

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Do you know this new expression, Georgina?

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Well, I know that whitewashing means trying to hide the truth about something.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Right, so greenwashing means trying to make people believe

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
that your company is doing more to protect the environment than it really is.

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Well, with so many achievements already behind him,

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm sure Jeff has made his grandparents very proud,

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
which reminds me of your quiz question, Neil.

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Ah, yes, I asked Georgina what happened when the car Jeff Bezos

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and his granddad Lawrence were fixing accidentally rolled downhill.

83
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I thought it was C, that Jeff lost all his hair.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Was I right?

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No, you were wrong, I'm afraid Georgina, the correct answer was that B,

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
his grandfather lost his thumb.

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay, now let's recap the vocabulary starting with customer experience,

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
a customer's feelings about their experience with a business.

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If you put something at the heart of things,

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
you make it the most important part.

91
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Web traffic is the number of people visiting a website.

92
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Your legacy means all your life achievements that will continue after your death.

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Someone who's on the right side of history will be judged positively by future generations.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
And finally, greenwashing is when you pretend that your company is doing more

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
to protect the environment than it really is.

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That's all for our peak inside the brain of the world's richest man.

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Join us again next time when we'll be discussing another trending topic.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Bye for now.

99
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Goodbye.
