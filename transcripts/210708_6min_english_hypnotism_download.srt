Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Rob.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,879
And I'm Sam.

5
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:24,320
Now, Sam, look into my eyes. You are feeling sleepy. Relax.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,920
What's he doing, Rob? Trying to hypnotise me?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,520
Well, since hypnotism is the topic of this programme, I thought I'd give it a try.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,240
So, how do you feel, Sam? Are you under my spell?

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,480
Hmm, I don't think so, Rob. It's not so easy to put me into a hypnostic trance.

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:50,320
That's the word to describe the state of mind of someone who's been hypnotised and isn't completely in control.

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,560
Ah, you mean like those stage magicians who trick people into

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,000
clucking like a chicken or playing an imaginary violin.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,160
Yes, some hypnotists make people do silly things for entertainment,

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,600
but hypnotism has real benefits as well. Curing phobias, for example.

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,760
Er, maybe so, but for other people, the very idea of a hypnotic trance is nonsense.

16
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,920
And even if hypnotism is real, why would you let a complete stranger inside your head?

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,040
Don't worry, Rob. I won't make you cluck like a chicken.

18
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:30,320
Oh, please don't. At least not before my quiz question, which is about a well-known 20th-century hypnotist.

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,200
One of the first Europeans to hypnotise people, this man became so famous that his name is forever

20
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:45,760
associated with hypnotic trances. But, who was he? Was it a Sigmund Freud, B. Franz Mesmer,

21
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,800
or C. Harry Houdini? Well, people want to quit smoking,

22
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:57,519
sometimes use a kind of therapy involving hypnotism. So maybe it's A. Sigmund Freud.

23
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,319
Okay, we'll find out if that's right at the end of the programme.

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,679
One question that's often asked is whether anyone can be hypnotised,

25
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:13,199
or are there people, maybe like you, Sam, who are less hypnotizable than others?

26
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:19,280
Professor Amiraz is a psychiatrist at the Brain Institute in Orange County, California.

27
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:27,599
According to him, there are two things which explain what makes one person more or less hypnotizable

28
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,639
than another. As he told BBC World Service programme, the wife actor.

29
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,039
And listen out for the first thing he mentions.

30
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,080
Initially, people thought that if you're very intelligent, you're likely to be less

31
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,560
suggestible. If you are male, you're likely to be less suggestible than if you're female.

32
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:51,360
These have been largely dismissed. In fact, it's about two things. First, absorption.

33
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,479
Your ability to get engrossed. In a particular activity, we all know people who are capable of

34
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:02,080
reading a book and losing track of time. We know the same thing about people who are watching a film

35
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,719
and beginning to cry, having all these emotional reactions, again, getting very much sucked into

36
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:13,439
the scene and being riveted. People often think you can be easily hypnotised if you are

37
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:20,639
suggestible or easily influenced by others. In fact, hypnotism is about two things.

38
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:28,960
Did you hear the first thing, Sam? Yes, it's getting absorbed. So absorbed that you lose track of time.

39
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,919
Become so occupied with something that you are unaware of the passing time.

40
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,240
And getting absorbed can also mean you get sucked into something.

41
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,240
Become involved in a situation when you do not want to be involved.

42
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:48,719
Stage hypnotists often speak in soothing, gentle ways to help this process of getting someone

43
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:55,520
absorbed or sacked in. But according to Professor Razz, there's a second important part to being

44
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:02,640
hypnotised. Attention. Listen to the definition of attention. Professor Razz gives to BBC World

45
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:11,600
Service Program the wife actor. The ability to get focused, to concentrate and hone in on particular

46
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:18,159
select pieces of information to the exclusion of others. Besides the relaxed,

47
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:25,040
dream-like feeling of being absorbed, what's also needed is the concentration to hone in on something.

48
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,040
In other words, to give it your full attention. What you hone in on could be the way the

49
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:38,079
hypnotist speaks, like how Rob said, look into my eyes at the beginning of the programme.

50
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:43,839
Or it could be some other object, like a moving finger, a pendulum or a swinging watch

51
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,240
that some hypnotists use. Well, I don't feel hypnotised or open.

52
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,799
But I'm certainly focused on one thing. My lunch. So come on, tell me. What's the correct answer to

53
00:04:54,799 --> 00:05:01,360
the quiz question? Okay Sam, I asked you which hypnotist was so famous that his name became used

54
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,959
as a verb. And what did you say? I guess it was a Sigmund Freud. It was a good guess,

55
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:13,519
but the correct answer was B, a German doctor called Franz Mesmer. Of course. And the word

56
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:20,719
named after him was mesmerised to have your attention completely fixed so that you can't think

57
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:27,120
of anything else. Well, that might be a problem if you want to remember this vocabulary. So let's

58
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,679
recap the words we've learned, starting with trance, a state of consciousness in which you are not

59
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,959
completely aware or in control. Someone who is suggestible is easily influenced by other people.

60
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:46,960
When you lose track of time, you become so absorbed with something that you are unaware of time

61
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,800
passing. And you might get sucked in, become involved in a situation that you don't want to.

62
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:59,360
Hypnotism also depends on concentration and the ability to hone in on something, to give

63
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,520
something your full attention. Until you're mesmerised, you have your attention completely fixed

64
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,439
so that you cannot think of anything else. That's all for this hypnotic journey. Bye for now. Bye bye.
