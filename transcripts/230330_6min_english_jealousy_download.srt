Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And I'm Neil.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Your friend Alicia phoned and left a message for you, Neil. She's sorry, but she has to cancel lunch today.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I think she's going with Jenny instead.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's the third time this week they've had lunch together. They're best friends now.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hmm, sounds like Neil has a case of the green-eyed monster. In other words, jealousy.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The fear that someone else may take something you think is yours.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Humans have struggled with jealousy for thousands of years.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Jealousy damages friendships, destroys relationships, and can even become a motive for murder.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In this programme, we'll discuss jealousy to find out what happens when the green-eyed monster raises its ugly head.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Meanwhile, my friend Alicia will be having lunch with Jenny instead of me.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh, feeling jealous is no fun. Maybe this question will take your mind off it.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The expression the green-eyed monster comes from a speech in one of William Shakespeare's most famous plays.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But which one? Is it a Romeo and Juliet?

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
B, Hamlet or C, or fellow?

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I think the answer is a fellow.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Okay, Neil. I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
For many people, feelings of jealousy occur in romantic relationships.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Here, psychologist, Dr. Alex Milky, explains why to the BBC World Service programme, Crowd Science.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So you have a friend, a significant other, your parents, and you have the feeling that this relationship is threatened by someone else,

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
starting some form of relationship with them, starting a new friendship, flirting with them, and so on.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Which is different from envy, for example, which is probably the emotion that gets you to act when someone has something you want,

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and you have to somehow get that from them. That's when you feel envious.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Jealousy can be a problem for husbands and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends, or anyone involved in a romantic relationship.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Dr. Milky uses the term significant other to describe any kind of romantic partner who you have a long-term relationship with.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You might feel jealous if someone flirts with your partner.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Flirting is when you behave as if you are sexually attracted to someone, but in a playful way, rather than with serious intentions.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Dr. Milky also notes the difference between two words people often confuse.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Jealousy and a similar term envy, wanting what someone else has.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You could be envious of someone's possessions like a new car. Their achievements like promotion at work, or a personal quality like being funny or good looking.

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So jealousy involves three people, you, your loved one, and someone else, whereas envy involves just two.

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You and the person who has something you want. But while these emotions are easy to define, they can be very difficult to manage.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Jealousy can lead to controlling behaviour, like checking your partner's text messages, or monitoring who they see, behaviour which damages relationships.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But unlike other psychological problems such as anxiety or obsessive-compulsive disorder, many do not feel brave enough to ask for help with their jealousy.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So what can people who struggle with jealousy do?

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:56,000
That's the question Caroline Steele, presenter of BBC World Service Programme Crowdscience, asked clinical psychologist Dr. Johann Arlin.

39
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
If there was sort of an ideal future for people looking for help with their jealousy, what would it be like?

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Could there be a pill, or would it be a specific therapy, or what's kind of a realistic ideal future?

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I believe that some kind of cognitive behavioural therapy, where you work with decreasing these monitoring and checking behaviours, like having a plan for how to do that, because that's not easy.

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And also at the same time, increasing activities or behaviours that harmonise with how you want to become.

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Unfortunately, Dr. Arlin says jealousy cannot be cured by taking a pill, medicine in the form of a small tablet that you swallow.

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Instead, he recommends cognitive behavioural therapy, or CBT for short. A therapy which helps people deal with their emotions by changing how they think about things.

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Instead of feeling jealous that your best friend is spending time with someone else, try feeling happy that she's made a new friend.

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Good idea. Plus, I won't have that horrid feeling of the green-eyed monster inside.

47
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Speaking of which, it's time to reveal the answer to your question, Sam.

48
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Ah, I asked which famous Shakespearean play first described jealousy as the green-eyed monster.

49
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I said it was a fellow, so was I right?

50
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:24,000
A fellow was the correct answer. A fellow becomes so jealous that he murders his wife, Desdemona, before killing himself. If only he'd had some therapy.

51
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Right, let's recap the vocabulary from this programme on the green-eyed monster, another name for jealousy.

52
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
A significant other is a wife, husband or other romantic partner, who you are in a long-term relationship with.

53
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Flirting means playfully pretending you are sexually attracted to someone.

54
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The emotion envy means wanting what someone else has.

55
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
A pill is medicine in the form of a small tablet which you swallow.

56
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And finally, cognitive behavioural therapy, or CBT, is a type of therapy where people are encouraged to change the way they think about their emotional and behavioural problems.

57
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Once again, our six minutes are up. Join us again soon for more emotional support, as well as new and useful vocabulary here at Six Minute English. Goodbye for now.

58
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Bye-bye.
