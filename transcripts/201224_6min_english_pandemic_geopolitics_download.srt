00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,359
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,559
And I'm Georgina.

6
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,920
I've really had enough of this coronavirus, Georgina.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,440
People getting sick, losing their jobs, and to top it off,

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,679
the pubs in some places are closed.

9
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,320
I know it's bad, Neil, but compared to historical pandemics like the Spanish flu

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,439
and economic crises like the Great Depression,

11
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,240
coronavirus isn't actually so bad.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,560
You've got to look at the bigger picture,

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,079
the long-term overall view of a complex situation.

14
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,439
Hmm, somehow that's not very comforting, Georgina.

15
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:48,560
But tell me more.

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,679
Well, we've heard lots from politicians and scientists

17
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,920
about the spread of coronavirus,

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,079
but a historian's view might give us a fresh look at the bigger picture.

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,880
And maybe a more hopeful point of view.

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,000
So in this programme, we'll be hearing from historian Peter Frankapan,

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,120
author of Best Selling Book, The Silk Roads.

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,480
Ah, the title of that book, The Silk Roads, reminds me of my quiz question, Georgina.

23
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,840
Are you ready to have a go?

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,359
I'll try, Neil, but the only thing I know about The Silk Roads

25
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,200
is that they were the ancient routes along which people travelled the earth.

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,880
Very good, Georgina, not just people, but also ideas,

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,960
religions, languages and diseases travelled from place to place

28
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,640
along these ancient roads.

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,439
But where exactly did The Silk Roads run?

30
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,120
That's my quiz question.

31
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,320
Was it A, from South America to Europe,

32
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,800
B, from Africa to Asia, or C, from Asia to Europe?

33
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,600
Well, since the current pandemic came from Wuhan,

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,159
I'll say C, from Asia to Europe.

35
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,359
Okay, Georgina, we'll find out later if that's right.

36
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,560
What's certain is that disease passing from place to place

37
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,599
and from animals to humans is nothing new.

38
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:04,799
Listen to historian Peter Frankapan being interviewed for the BBC programme Hard Talk.

39
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,800
See if you can hear the reason he goes for how diseases are spread.

40
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,359
Well, it's a fairly predictable thing a historian would say,

41
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:15,039
but change and widespread disease are nothing new.

42
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,479
Our ancestors all lived through big pandemic,

43
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,759
some of them which were much more lethal than coronavirus.

44
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,919
And one of the products of living together,

45
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,839
an in high density populations, going back as far as historical records go,

46
00:02:27,839 --> 00:02:31,919
is you find that there are transitions of disease from animals to human beings

47
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,759
and they inflict damage.

48
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,039
And that damage typically you measure in mortality rates,

49
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:39,759
but then the economic and social consequences of disease.

50
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,079
There's a lot of examples of history to learn from.

51
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:45,120
Compared to coronavirus, other big pandemics in history

52
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,200
have been much more lethal, dangerous enough to cause death.

53
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,439
One reason Peter gives for this is the high density of populations,

54
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,360
meaning people living together in buildings very close to one another.

55
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,759
In olden days, this included living together with animals,

56
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,520
making the transmission of disease to humans much easier.

57
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:11,280
Right Georgina, like the flea-infested rats which spread the plague across Europe in the Middle Ages.

58
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,879
But times change and today most people live in very different ways

59
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,120
from people living centuries ago.

60
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,599
So how can we explain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020

61
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,920
and why have some countries been able to deal with it so much better than others?

62
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,680
Here's Peter Frankapan again talking on the BBC's hard talk.

63
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,240
Listen and see if you can spot his answer.

64
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,240
Well, your geographical position in the world matters if you're if you're geographically peripheral,

65
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,879
like Scandinavia or New Zealand,

66
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,240
then you have a different dose, you have a different level of connectivity with the rest of the world.

67
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,719
If you are a country like the UK, which is the central global flight routes,

68
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,519
then the incidence of people coming back so forwards in and out of your country,

69
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,280
you're going to spread and catch much quicker.

70
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,000
The school card is very mixed and there have been some democratic systems that have been extremely resilient

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,199
and robust and anticipating it, and some that have got it wrong.

72
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,639
According to Peter, countries which are geographically peripheral

73
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,439
at the periphery or edge of things instead of at the centre are less at risk.

74
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,280
The UK, on the other hand, is at the centre of global flight routes,

75
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,639
the connecting flight paths used by airplanes.

76
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,120
Visiting air passengers who spread the disease are one of the reasons behind Britain's

77
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,279
dose of coronavirus.

78
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,079
Here, dose is used as an informal way of saying an unpleasant experience.

79
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,959
So from a historical viewpoint, this current pandemic doesn't seem so bad.

80
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,079
Far fewer people have died than in previous pandemics,

81
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,000
and with the arrival of a vaccine, the end is almost in sight.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,439
Hmm, I guess so, Georgina, but for now at least the pubs are still closed in some places.

83
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,639
Anyway, it was interesting to hear how diseases have been spreading since ancient times.

84
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,879
On routes like the Silk Roads, you mean?

85
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,000
So what was the answer to your quiz question now? Was I right?

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,759
You said the ancient Silk Roads ran C from Asia to Europe, which was correct.

87
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,759
They ran from Japan and the Far East through Asia and the Middle East,

88
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,079
bringing trade and spices as well as new ideas and languages to Europe.

89
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,680
Sounds like another example of looking at the bigger picture,

90
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,959
the long-term overall view of a complex situation.

91
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,199
Let's recap the other vocabulary too.

92
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,759
Diseases can be lethal, extremely dangerous, even causing death.

93
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,399
A high-density population is a population living very closely together.

94
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,639
Peripheral countries may be less at risk from pandemics because they are at the

95
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,159
periphery or edge of events instead of at the centre.

96
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:39,039
So, somewhere with fewer flight routes, the connecting pathways followed by airplanes

97
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,759
might get a less serious dose or unpleasant experience of coronavirus.

98
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,000
Well, I hope this experience hasn't been too unpleasant and you get a chance to use some of

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,919
this vocabulary chatting to your friends about trending stories in the news.

100
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:57,199
