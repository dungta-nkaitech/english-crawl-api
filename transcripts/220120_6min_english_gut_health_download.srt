Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Sam.

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,120
And I'm Neil.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:26,800
In recent years, new diets with names like vegan, keto and paleo have become very popular.

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,560
Are you a vegetarian, Neil?

6
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:30,640
Do you follow any particular diet?

7
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,039
Well, I eat lots of fresh fruit and vegetables and only a little meat from time to time.

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,920
Well, while many diets claim to improve health or help you lose weight,

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:48,399
recent research shows that what counts is not what you eat but how your body reacts.

10
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:54,640
Yes, and that reaction doesn't happen where you might think, not in the brain or tongue

11
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,120
or even the stomach, but in the gut. Another name for the intestines, the long tube inside your

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:08,960
body which digests food. Inside everyone's gut are millions of microbes, tiny living organisms,

13
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,079
too small to see without a microscope. Some of them are good for us, some bad.

14
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,840
Microbes help digest food, but they influence our bodies more than we know.

15
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,040
Think of them as chemical factories that cause our individual reaction to the food we eat.

16
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,280
This mix of gut microbes is unique and different for everyone, even identical twins.

17
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,439
And it's the reason why some doctors now recommend a personalized diet, one that perfectly fits

18
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,760
your own unique combination of microbes. We'll hear more soon, but first I have a question for

19
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,080
you, Neil, and it's about the gut, the tube which includes the large and small intestine.

20
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:57,520
It's very long, but how long exactly is the average adult's gut? Is it a three and a half meters,

21
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,120
b five and a half meters or c seven and a half meters?

22
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,520
Well, everybody is different, of course, but I'll say on average the gut is b five and a half meters

23
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,520
okay, Neil, I'll reveal the answer later in the program.

24
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,360
Among the first to investigate gut microbes was Dr Tim Specter, author of the best-selling book

25
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,680
The Diet Myth. He wanted to check whether the dietary advice he had heard and believed advice

26
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,680
like eat little and often or avoid fat was really true.

27
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,719
This introduction to Specter explained how he started to doubt some of this advice.

28
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,000
Food myths, he calls them, to BBC Radio 4 program The Life Scientific.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,960
All these so-called myths that I'd believed, whether it was about calories, about fats,

30
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:53,919
when to eat, how to eat, were based on flimsy or no evidence, very old, very poor quality,

31
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,439
and it had been repeated so much that people didn't think to question them.

32
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,159
One of the food myths Dr Specter questioned was counting calories, the units which

33
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,240
measure the amount of energy food provides. He discovered that much of the dietary advice he had

34
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:18,079
heard was either incorrect or based on flimsy evidence. If evidence is flimsy, it's weak and

35
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:24,800
unconvincing. As Dr Specter questioned these food myths, he remembered an earlier study involving

36
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:31,919
identical twins, pairs of brothers or sisters with the same genes. It was the surprising differences

37
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:38,799
and weight between one twin and another that made Dr Specter realise that no two people have

38
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:46,719
the same gut. Even identical twins' guts are different. But as he told BBC Radio 4's The Life

39
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:53,519
Scientific, the discovery came in a very smelly way by asking his volunteers to send samples of

40
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,799
their poo in the post. We collected lots of these samples, sequenced them, and then looked at twins

41
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:07,439
where one was overweight and one was skinny. We found in every case the skinnier twin had a more

42
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:15,040
diverse microbiome, greater numbers of different species. They also had high numbers of a couple

43
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,040
of microbes that just stuck out of the crowd. One was called Christensenella and the other one

44
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:28,160
was called Akamansia. Although genetically identical one twin was overweight, while the other twin

45
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,520
was skinny or very thin. Because the weight difference could not be explained genetically,

46
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,920
Dr Specter suspected the microbes in the skinnier twin's gut held the answer. The more diverse

47
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,840
someone's microbes, the better their gut was at digesting food, regulating fat and maintaining

48
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:53,040
health. Two microbes, Christensenella and Akamansia were especially effective. Dr Specter says these

49
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,280
microbes stuck out of the crowd, meaning they were easy to notice for the positive effect.

50
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,960
And since everyone's microbes are different, it follows that a personalized diet which selects

51
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,120
the friendliest food for your gut is best. Right, and all this talk of eating is making me hungry,

52
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,439
so tell me Sam was my answer to your question right? Ah yes, I asked about the length of the

53
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:24,399
gut in the average adult. I said it was five and a half meters. Which was the correct answer,

54
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,519
well done Neil, that took guts, which is the second meaning of the word, courage.

55
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,800
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned starting with gut, an informal word for the intestines,

56
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:44,000
the tube which digests food from the stomach. Microbes are microscopic organisms living inside the

57
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,519
body. A calorie is a unit measuring how much energy food provides. If an argument or evidence is

58
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:59,439
flimsy, it's weak and hard to believe. A skinny person is very thin. And finally, if something sticks

59
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:06,399
out of the crowd, it's noticeable in a good way. Unfortunately our six minutes are up, but remember

60
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,239
look after your gut and your gut will look after you. Goodbye!
