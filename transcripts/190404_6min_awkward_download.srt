00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,320
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil and I'm Dan.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,800
Now then, Dan, do you ever feel awkward?

7
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:20,800
Awkward?

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,080
Yes, feeling uncomfortable, embarrassed or self-conscious in a social situation

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,000
with something isn't quite right.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,320
Sometimes, I remember always feeling very awkward watching TV with my parents

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,719
if there was an explicit love scene, you know, people canutling.

12
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,759
Ooh, yes. Me too. And that feeling of awkwardness is what we're looking at in today's

13
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,920
6 Minute English and how it's all connected to social rules.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,079
Social rules are the unspoken rules which we follow in everyday life.

15
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,159
The way we interact with other people and particularly with strangers.

16
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:01,839
Yes, for example, if you're waiting at a bus stop, it's okay to talk about the weather to a stranger.

17
00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:06,319
But it would be very awkward if you broke that social rule by asking them about,

18
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,719
oh, I don't know, how much money they earned.

19
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,879
Yes, that would be wrong, wouldn't it?

20
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,439
And we'll find out about another awkward situation on the Underground Railway

21
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:22,560
later in the programme before that, though, a quiz, which city has the oldest underground railway?

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,519
Is it A London, B New York or C Tokyo?

23
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,840
Aha, well, I'm pretty confident about this, I think it's London.

24
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,480
Well, I'll have the answer later in the programme.

25
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,600
Dr. Raj Pursaud is a psychologist.

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,120
He was a guest on the BBC Radio programme seriously.

27
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,359
He was talking about social rules.

28
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:45,520
How does he say they affect our lives?

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,320
How do we understand what the implicit social rules are that govern our behaviour?

30
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,679
They're so implicit. They're so almost invisible, yet we all obey them,

31
00:01:57,679 --> 00:01:59,839
but either massively powerful.

32
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:04,799
They're the only way to get at them because you couldn't use an MRI brain scanner or a microscope.

33
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,079
What's the tool you would use to illuminate the social rules that actually govern our lives?

34
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,959
How do they affect our lives?

35
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,439
He says that they govern our behaviour.

36
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,280
They govern our lives.

37
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,680
This means that they control our lives.

38
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,199
They rule our lives.

39
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,679
What's interesting is that he says the social rules are implicit.

40
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,280
They're not written down anywhere.

41
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,439
They are unspoken, but understood.

42
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:32,639
If they're unspoken and not written down,

43
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,399
how can scientists and sociologists study them?

44
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:38,399
How can they find out about them?

45
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:40,799
They need a way to illuminate the rules.

46
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:45,199
This means a way of shining a metaphorical light on them to see what they are.

47
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:47,439
Here's Dr. Pursaud again.

48
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,159
How do we understand what the implicit social rules are that govern our behaviour?

49
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,240
They're so implicit.

50
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,520
They're so almost invisible, yet we all obey them,

51
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,680
but either massively powerful.

52
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,680
They're the only way to get at them because you couldn't use an MRI brain scanner

53
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,639
or a microscope.

54
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,919
What's the tool you would use to illuminate the social rules that actually govern our lives?

55
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,000
One way to find out about a rule is to break it.

56
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,080
Another word for break when we're talking about rules is breach.

57
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,000
And breaching experiments we use to learn about social rules.

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,039
Here's Dr. Pursaud describing one of those experiments.

59
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,879
You breached the social rule on purpose.

60
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,520
So a classic one, people would go into the metro,

61
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,680
the underground railway tube, and there'd be only one person sitting in the carriage.

62
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,840
You would go and sit next to that person.

63
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,560
And if that led to awkwardness or discomfort with the person got off the tube stop immediately,

64
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,319
you had discovered a social rule.

65
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,599
So what was the experiment?

66
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,520
Well, quite simply, find a nearly empty train carriage

67
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,680
and then go and sit right next to someone rather than a distance away.

68
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,039
If that person then feels uncomfortable or awkward,

69
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,439
and that's something you can tell by watching their behaviour,

70
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,400
for example, do they change seat, move carriage, or get off the train completely?

71
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,680
If they do, then you know you've discovered a rule.

72
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,879
So you find a rule by breaking it or breaching it.

73
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,160
Okay, time to review our vocabulary.

74
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,879
But first, let's have the answer to the quiz question.

75
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,720
I asked which city has the oldest underground railway?

76
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,560
Is it A, London, B, New York, and C, Tokyo?

77
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,000
Dan, you were pretty confident.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,399
I was. I said London, but now I'm having second thoughts.

79
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,920
I think it might be New York.

80
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,800
That's a little bit awkward, isn't it?

81
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,240
Well, it is London, so I don't know if you're right or wrong.

82
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,319
Ah, I feel a bit uncomfortable now.

83
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,720
The facts are that London opened in 1863.

84
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,879
New York was 1904 and Tokyo 1927.

85
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,319
Well done and extra bonus points if you knew any of those dates.

86
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,800
Now it's time for our vocabulary.

87
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,160
I hope it doesn't make you feel awkward, but can you start, Dan?

88
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,199
Of course.

89
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,319
And the adjective awkward, and its noun awkwardness,

90
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,400
are on our list for today.

91
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,079
They mean an uncomfortable feeling in a social situation.

92
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,519
This is all connected with the idea of social rules.

93
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,799
Unspoken but well-known rules which we follow in daily life

94
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:20,959
to avoid awkward situations.

95
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,599
The rules, as Neil said, are not spoken and they're not written down.

96
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:27,759
But we know them and understand them.

97
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,479
They are implicit, and these implicit rules govern our lives.

98
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,439
The verb govern means to control and rule.

99
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:39,279
To see something clearly, either in reality or metaphorically,

100
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,120
you need to put some light on it.

101
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,959
You need to illuminate it.

102
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,560
And that was the next of our words, the verb illuminate.

103
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,800
And finally, we had a word which means when we're talking about rules,

104
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,319
the same as break.

105
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,560
To breach in experiments, they breached the rules to learn more about them.

106
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,639
Well, we don't want to breach any rules,

107
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,120
so it's time for us to leave you for today.

108
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,639
But don't worry, we will be back.

109
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,680
In the meantime, you can find us in all the usual places online

110
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,039
and on social media.

111
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,120
Just look for BBC Learning English.

112
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,839
Bye for now.

113
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,639
Bye-bye.
