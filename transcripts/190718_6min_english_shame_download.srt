Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,399
And I'm Sam.

6
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,679
In this programme we'll be talking about the emotion of shame.

7
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,640
What can you tell us about this word, Sam?

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,280
Well, it can be a verb or a noun.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,280
As a noun, it's an emotion for the uncomfortable feeling we have

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,200
when we feel embarrassed or guilty about something that we've done.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,120
It's a very strong feeling.

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,120
We'll explore this topic in more detail shortly, but first a question.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,760
Now, it might seem like a random question,

14
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,960
but all will become clear later, I promise.

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,600
The chemical which is used to make cooking pans non-stick was discovered by accident.

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,520
When was this?

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,040
Was it A, the 1930s, B, the 1960s, or C, the 1980s?

18
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,000
What do you think, Sam?

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,359
Ah, well, first I have no idea what non-stick cookware has to do with our topic of shame,

20
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:12,480
but as to the question itself, I think it has something to do with NASA and the space programme.

21
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,960
So I'm going to say 1960s.

22
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,920
Well, we will find out later in the programme if you are right.

23
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:22,240
The idea of shame is not new by any means,

24
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,159
but social media has made it a very modern concept, hasn't it?

25
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,920
Yes. When it's used as a verb to shame someone,

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,280
it means to say or write things in public,

27
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,120
designed to make other people feel bad about their behaviour,

28
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,399
and this is something we see a lot in social media.

29
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:45,519
This topic was discussed on a recent edition of the BBC Radio programme Woman's Hour.

30
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,439
One of the guests was Heter Howes from City University London.

31
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,319
Does she think that shame is always a bad thing?

32
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,879
If you have too much shame, it's crippling, it's sort of debilitating and that's bad,

33
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,959
but the right amount of shame can be really positive because it affects change.

34
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,639
And I wonder if we're starting to see that a bit in modern culture as well

35
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:11,439
from social media platforms, that if someone's done something that we consider to be

36
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:16,400
a little bit wrong, we can sort of publicly shame them and maybe affect some positive change.

37
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,479
So is shame always bad?

38
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:26,879
Well, she does say that too much shame can be crippling and debilitating.

39
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:33,439
Both these words mean that shame is so strong that we really can't manage the emotion.

40
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,879
We can't deal with it, we can't do anything to put it right.

41
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,120
But she does say that a bit of shame can be positive because it affects change.

42
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:46,159
This means that it causes change.

43
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:52,719
If someone is shamed on social media, it's very public and can mean that they change their behaviour.

44
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,599
I suppose though there is one group I think have to accept public shaming,

45
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,519
or perhaps deserve it more than others.

46
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,319
I think I can guess, would it be politicians perhaps?

47
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,400
These days we are very cynical about politicians, aren't we?

48
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:14,800
Social media is one area where the public can directly contact and comment on

49
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,160
what their representatives are or aren't doing.

50
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,600
But politicians are a particular kind of person aren't they?

51
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,320
Contrary to historian Tiffany Wattsmith made this comment on the same woman's hour program.

52
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,560
Shame is I can't be very very useful and the idea of someone who doesn't experience it at all,

53
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,600
like a sort of teflon coated politician. I mean that's a kind of frightening image.

54
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,360
What's she saying here Sam?

55
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,400
She's talking about how some politicians do not seem to be bothered by shaming.

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,080
They just ignore it and move on. She describes them as teflon coated.

57
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,160
This is a ha, a reference to nonstick cookware.

58
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,760
Teflon is the brand name of the chemical which was used to make pots and pans nonstick.

59
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,920
The pans were coated or covered in this material.

60
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:12,479
The reference to politicians is that there are some to whom criticism and shame just don't stick.

61
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:16,639
They manage to avoid any negative consequences of their actions.

62
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,759
And this she says is scary.

63
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,000
Here's Tiffany Wattsmith again.

64
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,240
Shame is I can't be very very useful and the idea of someone who doesn't experience it at all,

65
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,279
like a sort of teflon coated politician. I mean that's that's a kind of frightening image.

66
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:40,959
It's nearly time now to review however vocabulary, but first let's have the answer to the quiz question

67
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:46,799
which was about nonstick coating on cookware or teflon as we heard. When was it invented?

68
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:53,759
A. The 1930s, B. The 1960s or C. The 1980s. What did you think Sam?

69
00:04:54,559 --> 00:05:00,399
I guess the 1960s and I think it was invented as part of the US space program.

70
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,639
Well a lot of people think that and like you, a lot of people are wrong.

71
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,000
It was actually discovered by accident in 1938 so well done if you got that right,

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,159
but no shame if you didn't. Now on with today's words.

73
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:20,159
Okay, yes. We were talking about shame, an uncomfortable feeling of guilt and embarrassment

74
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:25,919
at something we've done. Shame can be crippling and debilitating. Both these adjectives

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,920
mean making someone unable to deal with the situation. They can feel so badly about what they've

76
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:38,879
done that they find it difficult to move forward emotionally. We then had to affect change.

77
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:46,800
This means to make change happen. Note this is effect with an E and not effect with an A.

78
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,000
Teflon is a nonstick covering for cookware. And something that is coated with something is

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,319
covered with something. So Teflon Cosaid means covered in Teflon.

80
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,800
Well that's all for this program. We'll be with you again soon, but if you can't wait,

81
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,360
you can find us in all the usual places on social media, online and on our app.
