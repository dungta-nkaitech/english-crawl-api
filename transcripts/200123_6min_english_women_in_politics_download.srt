00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,200
Hello, this is 6MtEnglish, I'm Sam.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,800
And I'm Georgina.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,440
How do you feel about politics, Georgina?

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,839
Well, there's a lot around at the moment.

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,039
Yes, indeed.

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,960
One thing I would like to see in politics,

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,120
particularly British politics,

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,039
is more women in Parliament.

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,759
About 34% of our MPs are women,

14
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:34,079
which is the highest it's ever been,

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,119
but it's still not close to 50%.

16
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:38,799
In order to be elected though,

17
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:41,679
you first have to stand, don't you?

18
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,759
Yes, we use a verb stand

19
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,960
when you are a candidate someone can vote for.

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,439
Women in politics is our topic today.

21
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:51,679
Before we get into it, today's question.

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,920
Which country has the highest percentage of women in its Parliament?

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:04,079
Is it A, Rwanda, B, Sweden, or C, New Zealand?

24
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,439
What do you think, Georgina?

25
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,439
Hmm, I'm not sure.

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,920
I know New Zealand was one of the first countries

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,519
to allow women to vote,

28
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:13,840
and they currently have a female prime minister,

29
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,599
but I think it's actually an African country.

30
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,439
So I'm going to say Rwanda.

31
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,960
Okay, we'll see if you're correct at the end of the programme.

32
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:26,079
There are a number of projects in the UK at the moment

33
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,239
trying to get more women interested in standing for Parliament.

34
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,919
One of these is the campaign sign up to stand

35
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:37,199
from an organisation called 5050 Parliament.

36
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,519
Lucrezco is someone who has taken up that challenge

37
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,319
and is hoping to stand in upcoming elections.

38
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,759
She was a guest on the BBC Radio programme Women's Hour.

39
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,359
She wasn't always interested in politics though.

40
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,719
How does she describe it?

41
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,680
I didn't really see myself in the houses of Parliament.

42
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,640
When we see it on TV, it looks extremely boring.

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,519
Politics looks boring, especially as a young person.

44
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,400
And so when I saw it, 5050 Parliament were including women

45
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,680
and including young women

46
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,759
and including a diverse range of young women,

47
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,039
I thought, wow, this is really for me and it can be for me.

48
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,599
So I decided to sign up to stand

49
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,840
and ever since I've just been excited

50
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,920
at the prospect of me standing for Parliament.

51
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,000
So what was her original feeling about politics?

52
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,760
Boring.

53
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,200
She thought it was boring, particularly as a young person.

54
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,400
In fact, she couldn't see herself as a politician.

55
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
She couldn't imagine herself doing it.

56
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,560
She says that she's now excited at the prospect of standing.

57
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,320
What does she mean by that?

58
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,960
The prospect of something is the possibility of something.

59
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,440
So before she thought it was boring,

60
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,920
now she's excited at the possibility

61
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,079
that she could be a member of Parliament.

62
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:55,519
So what was it that made her change her mind

63
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,239
and think that politics wasn't so boring after all?

64
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:00,639
Here's Lecresco again.

65
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,799
I think everybody has a politician within them

66
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:07,199
because we all get angry about something.

67
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,239
But unfortunately, when we see it, it's all jargon.

68
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,039
It's not words that we can understand

69
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,000
as even just as a working class person who hasn't,

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,679
you know, been to a private school

71
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,560
and who's come from a disadvantaged background.

72
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,680
And so I've realised, you know, politics is for absolutely everybody.

73
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,360
It's just the way that you speak about it.

74
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,800
That has to be tailored to everyone.

75
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,920
One of the things she didn't like about politics was the jargon.

76
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,480
Well, no one likes jargon, do they?

77
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,200
jargon is the very specific language

78
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,080
and vocabulary relating to a particular profession.

79
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,600
Inside the profession, people know what it means.

80
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,000
But from outside, it can seem very complicated and confusing.

81
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,759
Lecresco said she came from a disadvantaged background.

82
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:55,759
This means that when she was growing up,

83
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,919
her family didn't have very much money

84
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,319
and that made life and study very difficult.

85
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,519
But even though, or maybe because she came from a

86
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,599
disadvantaged background, she has become interested in politics

87
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,240
and thinks that it can be something for everyone.

88
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,479
But rather than use jargon, you have to tailor the way you speak for everyone.

89
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,519
To tailor something is to make it fit.

90
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,480
In the same way that a tailor makes clothes fit,

91
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,719
you can tailor your language to make it easy for everyone to understand.

92
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:27,519
And one way to do that is to cut out the jargon.

93
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,639
That's just about all we have time for today.

94
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,039
But before we review the vocabulary,

95
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,680
it's time to get the answer to today's quiz question.

96
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,000
Which country has the highest percentage of women in its parliament?

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,360
Is it A.

98
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,240
Rwanda.

99
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,520
B. Sweden.

100
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,120
Or C. New Zealand.

101
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,960
Georgina, what did you say?

102
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,680
I made an educated guess of Rwanda.

103
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,800
An educated guess and a correct guess.

104
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,759
Well done.

105
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,960
And well done to everyone else who got that right too.

106
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,040
According to 2019 figures,

107
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,879
Rwanda's parliament has over 60% women MPs.

108
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,240
Go Rwanda.

109
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,280
Okay, let's remind ourselves of today's vocabulary.

110
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,280
Of course, to stand is the verb we use when someone is a candidate

111
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,479
in an election.

112
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,679
When someone stands for election, you can vote for them.

113
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:17,919
If you can see yourself as something,

114
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,199
it means that you can imagine yourself doing that thing.

115
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,319
The prospect of something is the possibility of something.

116
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,679
So for example,

117
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:30,399
the prospect of becoming an MP is something that excites lucrass.

118
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,759
Something that we all hate,

119
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,279
except when we use it ourselves, is jargon.

120
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,199
Words and language that are very specific to a particular job,

121
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,120
in which are difficult for people outside that profession to understand.

122
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,680
People who grow up without enough money

123
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,039
and without access to education can be said to come from a disadvantaged background.

124
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,240
And finally, to tailor something is to change it

125
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,800
to make it suitable for a particular purpose.

126
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,079
So for example, if you want to make politics accessible for more people,

127
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,039
you have to tailor your language and cut out the jargon.

128
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:05,599
Indeed.

129
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,840
Well, it's time for us to go now,

130
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,439
but do join us again soon.

131
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,240
Bye for now.

132
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,879
Bye!
