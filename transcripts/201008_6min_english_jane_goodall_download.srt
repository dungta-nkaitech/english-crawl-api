00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,800
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,160
I'm Rob. And I'm Sam.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,760
Having your photograph appear on the cover of a magazine

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,920
makes you famous around the world.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,879
But imagine if that photo showed you hugging and playing with wild chimpanzees.

9
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:34,000
That's exactly what happened to Jane Goodall, who shot to fame in 1965

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,119
when she appeared on the cover of National Geographic magazine.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,519
Jane introduced the world to the social and emotional lives of the wild chimpanzees of

12
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:46,000
Gumbay in eastern Tanzania.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,159
Jane spent years living among families of wild chimpanzees.

14
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,879
Her observations changed the way we view our closest animal relatives,

15
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,159
and made us think about what it means to be human.

16
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,479
In this programme we'll be hearing from the iconic environmentalist Jane Goodall.

17
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:08,319
She reflects on how attitudes have changed as science has uncovered the deep connections between

18
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:15,199
humans and the great apes. Large primates including chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans

19
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:17,679
who are closely related to humans.

20
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:21,120
And of course we'll be learning some related vocabulary along the way.

21
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:25,439
As well as Dr Goodall, the National Geographic photographs

22
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,159
also made the chimpanzees of Gumbay famous.

23
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,759
People around the world became interested in the lives of a family of chimps

24
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,400
living in a remote corner of Africa.

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:43,359
When Gumbay's alpha female died in 1972, she was so well loved that she had an obituary

26
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:48,799
in the Times newspaper. But what was her name? That's our quiz question.

27
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,479
Which chimpanzees obituary appeared in the Times?

28
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,640
Was it a Frodo, B-flow or C-Froid?

29
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:05,680
Well 1972 is a bit before my time, Rob. I wasn't even born then, but I think it's B-flow.

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,640
Okay Sam, we'll find that later if you were right.

31
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:16,480
Now, when Jane first visited Tanzania in the 1960s, most scientists believe the only animals

32
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,599
capable of making and using tools were humans.

33
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,519
But what Jane witnessed about the behaviour of one chimpanzee, who she named greybeard,

34
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:32,639
turned this idea on its head. Here she recalls that famous day to Jim Al-Kalili

35
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:38,000
for the podcast of BBC Radio 4's Discovery programme The Life Scientific.

36
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,319
I could see this black hand picking grass stems and pushing them down into the termite mound

37
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,719
and pulling them out with termites clinging on with their jaws.

38
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:58,319
And the following day I saw him pick a leafy twig and strip the leaves. So not only was he using

39
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,879
objects as tools, but modifying those objects to make tools.

40
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,039
Jane observed the chimpanzee greybeard, finding small wooden branches called twigs

41
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,599
and modifying them, changing them slightly in order to improve them.

42
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,840
By stripping away the leaves from twigs and using them to collect ants and termites to eat,

43
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,799
greybeard had made a tool, an instrument or simple piece of equipment for example a knife or

44
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,959
hammer that you hold in your hands and use for a particular job.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,639
Previously, it was believed that animals were incapable of making tools on their own.

46
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,039
What Jane saw was proof of the intelligence of wild animals.

47
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,680
Jane Goodall's studies convinced her that chimps experienced the same range of emotions as humans.

48
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,599
As she explains here, to BBC Radio 4's The Life Scientific.

49
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:01,519
I wasn't surprised that chimps had these emotions. It was fascinating to realise how many

50
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,759
of their gestures are like us so you can watch the without knowing anything about them.

51
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,919
And when they greet with a kiss and embrace, they pat one another in reassurance,

52
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:18,319
they hold hands, they seek physical contact to alleviate nervousness or stress.

53
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:25,759
You know, it's so like us. Holding hands in racing and kissing with some of the chimpanzees'

54
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:32,240
gestures, movements made with hands, arms or head to express ideas and feelings.

55
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:38,480
In the same way as humans, the chimpanzees would pat each other, touch someone gently and

56
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,680
repeatedly with their hand held flat. Much of their behaviour was human-like.

57
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,640
Just as I would hug a friend to reassure them, the chimps used physical contact to alleviate stress,

58
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:58,879
make pain or problems less intense or severe. In fact, chimps are so alike us that sometimes they

59
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:04,960
even get their name in the newspaper. Yes, Sam, you mean the quiz question I asked you earlier.

60
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,399
Which chimpanzee had their obituary published in the Times?

61
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:17,120
And I guess it was B flow. And that's absolutely right, well done, Sam. Give yourself a pat on the back.

62
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,519
Aha, okay. In this programme, we've been hearing about legendaries,

63
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:27,919
aologist and activist, Jane Goodall and her experiences living among great apes,

64
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,039
primates like chimpanzees who are humans closest animal relatives.

65
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:39,680
Jane witnessed the chimpanzees of Gombe modify or slightly alter objects like leaves and twigs

66
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,480
to make tools. Hand-held instruments used for a particular job. Many of the chimpanzees' gestures,

67
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,320
body movements made to communicate and express emotions like kissing and patting,

68
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,240
touching someone gently and repeatedly with a flat hand were almost human.

69
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,319
And just like us, the chimps sought physical contact to alleviate or reduce the severity of

70
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,000
nervousness and stress. And that's all for this programme. Bye for now. Bye bye.
