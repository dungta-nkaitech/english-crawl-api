4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,600
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,640
And I'm Sam.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,559
Do you like trying new food?

7
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,000
I do indeed. I love eating foods from around the world

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,480
and I especially like trying out restaurants that serve new kinds of food.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,600
Mmm, me too.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,480
And I like food that is a mix of different styles,

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,640
sometimes called fusion food.

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,359
But could I tempt you to some insect tapass or a tarantula donut?

13
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:40,880
Mmm, maybe not.

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,519
The idea of eating food made from bugs and creepy crawlies doesn't appeal.

15
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:48,240
Well, maybe I can convince you in this programme

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,719
because that's what we're discussing and teaching you some vocabulary along the way.

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,079
But first, I must serve you a question to answer.

18
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,359
It's about food, but not made from bugs.

19
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,000
Do you know what type of food is sometimes known as priest chokers?

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,239
Is it a cheese, b, pasta or c potato?

21
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,239
I think I know this one, Neil.

22
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,000
It's pasta, isn't it?

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,400
Well, I'll give you the answer at the end of the programme.

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,280
But let's get back to food made from bugs,

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,920
which is a growing trend in the Western world.

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,480
Insects are an alternative source of food.

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,600
And experts say they're filled with lots of good nutrients,

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,159
including amino acids and protein.

29
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,760
And eating them could help to fight world hunger and reduce pollution.

30
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,719
I'm not convinced yet, but I do know that the word for eating insects is entomophagy.

31
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,359
And it's something BBC World Service programme The Food Chain discussed.

32
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,600
The programme spoke to experts who think cooking with bugs is a great idea.

33
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,840
One of them was Andy Holcroft,

34
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,680
founding director of grub kitchen and bug farm foods.

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,880
He explained the challenge of getting some people to eat bugs.

36
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,480
In the Western culture, we have got a bit of an uphill, I'd say,

37
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,920
struggle because preconceptions around eating insects

38
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,080
already ingrained in society.

39
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,560
So we already think, before we've even tried them,

40
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,400
they're going to taste disgusting or gross.

41
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,599
So to actually get someone to put it in your mouth,

42
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,520
the easiest way we find straightaway is to try maybe a cricket cookie.

43
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,240
Or a chocolate chip cricket cookie, where you have, we're using cricket powder.

44
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,880
So you don't actually see any insects whatsoever.

45
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,240
You're getting the idea that you're eating them so people can deal with that a bit more than

46
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,600
actually seeing the whole insects.

47
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,600
Interestingly, it seems to be Western cultures that don't like eating insects.

48
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,080
Perhaps because it's thought to be wrong or just disgusting, even if it's not.

49
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,480
As Andy says, people have preconceived ideas about it.

50
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,359
To change these ideas is an uphill struggle or needs a lot of effort to achieve.

51
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,039
Yes, the negative attitude to eating bugs is ingrained into society,

52
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,679
meaning it is a long-lasting attitude that is difficult to change.

53
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:09,120
But Andy and other chefs are trying to change that attitude by subtly introducing insects into food,

54
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,159
such as his chocolate chip cricket cookies.

55
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,399
This is just for starters.

56
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,360
Other interesting and exotic dishes where you do see the bugs you're eating are now being served.

57
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,480
I'm still not convinced, but maybe chef Joseph Yoon can change my mind.

58
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,159
He is a chef and an edible insect ambassador.

59
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,159
He's also trying to persuade the squeamish people easily upset by something unpleasant

60
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,920
to overcome their fears of cricket, worms and spiders,

61
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,400
and instead see them as a tasty alternative source of protein.

62
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,760
Here he is speaking on the BBC's Food Chain Program,

63
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,159
talking about changing people's attitudes.

64
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,680
We approach our work with openness, with understanding and inclusivity.

65
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,280
When people approach me and they go like,

66
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,240
oh, are they react very viscerally?

67
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,080
I don't get confrontational.

68
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,640
I go like, I understand that you can feel that way.

69
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,240
And what we need to do is start changing these perceptions from insects as being a pest that bites you

70
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:16,560
or they carry disease to edible insects, something that's sustainably farmed and harvested,

71
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,319
specifically for human consumption.

72
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,720
So Joseph is passionate about edible insects,

73
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,319
but is understanding of people who don't like the idea and maybe show this viscerally,

74
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,800
having an emotional reaction rather than one based on fact or reason.

75
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,960
But Joseph wants to change these negative emotions by explaining the insects are farmed

76
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:45,199
purely for humans to eat and they are farmed sustainably in a way that can last for a long time

77
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,959
and is good for the environment.

78
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,399
I suppose we kill animals such as cows and sheep to eat,

79
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:52,719
so why not insects or spiders?

80
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:58,319
The debate about this continues, but there's no debate about the answer to today's questions, Sam.

81
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:04,319
Earlier I asked you if you knew what type of food is sometimes known as priest choker.

82
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,719
And I was sure it was pasta.

83
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,240
For it is pasta.

84
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,960
Strots are pretty, which means priest chokers in Italian is an elongated form of cavatelli pasta.

85
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,240
Its name is thought to come from the greedy priests who are so enthralled by the pasta

86
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,800
that they eat too quickly and choke themselves.

87
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,960
No bugs were involved though.

88
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,120
That's good to know because we have been talking about entomophagy,

89
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,760
a word for the practice of eating insects.

90
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:37,360
Other vocabulary we mentioned included fusion, which means a mix of different styles,

91
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,480
and the expression an uphill struggle means needs a lot of effort to achieve.

92
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,240
Something that is ingrained is a long-lasting attitude that is difficult to change.

93
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,000
Visually describes having an emotional reaction rather than one based on fact or reason.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,599
And doing something sustainably is doing it in a way that can last for a long time

95
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,600
and is good for the environment.

96
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,760
Well that's all for this 6 Minute English.
