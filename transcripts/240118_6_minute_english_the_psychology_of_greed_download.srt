00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, this is 6-Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm writing my birthday wish list, Beth.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Listen, I want a new laptop, a gold Rolex watch and a red sports car.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Phew, that is quite a lot, Neil. Isn't that a bit greedy?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So what? Greed is good. We're genetically built to want things that increase our social status,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
power and material possessions like money, a nice house, a fast car, all that stuff.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hmm, I'm not so sure, Neil. Remember, Greed is also one of the seven deadly sins.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hmm, in this programme we'll be discussing Greed, the desire to accumulate stuff,

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
keep it for yourself and not share it with others.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And of course, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But first I have a question for you, Beth.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You reminded me of a famous quote by one of history's greatest leaders.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The world has enough for everyone's need, but not everyone's greed.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But who said it? Was it A, the Dalai Lama, B, Mahatma Gandhi, or C, Martin Luther King?

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I think it was Mahatma Gandhi.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay, Beth, I'll reveal the correct answer at the end of the programme.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
At the neurological level, greed is controlled by the reward centre of the brain.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Greedy people feel good when they choose the stuff they want,

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and this happens at the unconscious emotional level of the brain,

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
meaning there's little conscious awareness about how greedy actions might affect others or be unfair.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But what does this look like in real life?

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's what University of California psychologist, Professor Paul Piff,

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
investigated using the classic family board game, Menopoli.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The game was rigged to give one rich player an advantage by letting them roll two dice instead of one,

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and collecting twice as much money as the poor player when passing go.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So what happened when Professor Piff asked the rich players why they had inevitably won the fixed game?

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Listen to the answer he gave to BBC Radio 4 programme, seven deadly psychologies.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
They took credit for their wins.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
They talked about how they'd controlled their own outcomes.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
They talked about how it was the decisions they'd made that had led to their being ultimately victorious,

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and not that flip of a coin that randomly got them into that position of privilege in the first place.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Now I don't know that this is a perfect model for how privilege, success or wealth operates in everyday life.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Some people indeed have worked themselves up other than bootstraps and get what they have because they worked hard.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Interestingly, the rich players took credit for winning.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If you take credit for something, you accept praise and recognition for doing something,

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
whether or not that praise and recognition is deserved.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
In fact, it was the fixed game that determined who would win and lose not anything the players did.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Professor Piff uses the expression the flip of a coin to describe something which is based solely on random chance,

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
like when you flip a coin into the air.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Whether it lands on heads or tails is pure luck.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yet the winning players claimed they won thanks to their own skill and ability.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Here, Professor Piff uses another idiom to pull yourself up by your bootstraps,

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
meaning to improve your situation through your own hard work without help from anyone else.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Worryingly, the experiment showed how feeling financially better off than others can easily change into feeling better than others.

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And the reason behind these feelings could be what money buys you, especially one thing, space.

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
If you're rich, you own a big house, at work, you have your own spacious private office.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You live in your own private bubble.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Here's Professor Piff again talking with BBC Radio 4's Seven Deadly Psychologies.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
People who are well off are just more socially independent.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
They don't need others in their lives as much.

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And when you don't need others, well, your empathy might suffer as a result.

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
People who are well off and rich enough to do what they want rely on other people less.

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
As a result, they make lack empathy.

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The ability to share someone else's feelings by imagining what it would be like to be them.

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Maybe it's not greed itself that's bad, but the things were greedy for.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Being greedy for social justice or a clean environment is good, right?

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Something to be admired by the world leader in your question, Neil?

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yes, I asked you who said the world has enough for everyone's need, but not everyone's greed.

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You said it was Mahatma Gandhi, which was the correct answer, Beth.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this programme, starting with stuff,

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
an informal word for material possessions.

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
To take credit for something means to allow people to believe that something you did deserves praise or recognition.

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The phrase a flip of a coin refers to an action or decision based on luck or random chance.

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If you pull yourself up by your bootstraps, you improve your situation through your own efforts without help from anyone else.

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Someone who is well off is rich enough to be able to have most of what they want.

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And finally, empathy means experiencing someone else's feelings by putting yourself in their place.

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
