00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:12,040
Hello, this is 6-Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,559
And I'm Georgie. In this programme, we're discussing a controversial topic that often

4
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:22,080
produces strong feelings. Should animals be kept in zoos? What's your opinion on this

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,600
debate, Neil? Oh, it's a really difficult question, Georgie. I think there are good scientific

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:34,719
reasons for having animals in zoos, but also it seems to me a little bit sad and cruel

7
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,320
for wild animals to be locked up. For some, zoos are a good way to teach people about

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,240
nature and save endangered species from extinction. Others think separating animals from their natural

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:53,760
habitat is cruel and unnecessary. Either way, with an estimated 700 million visitors every year,

10
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:59,519
zoos remain popular. But, are they a good thing? We'll be debating the pros and cons as well as

11
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:04,640
learning some useful new words and phrases. And remember, you can find all the vocabulary for

12
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,439
this programme on our website, BBCLearningEnglish.com. Now, I have a question for you, Georgie.

13
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:18,400
In 2022, five animals escape from Sydney's Taronga Zoo in Australia, but were they escaped

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:27,680
animals A, elephants, B, lions or C, zebras? I can imagine zebras running away from the zoo.

15
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,040
Okay, we'll find out the answer at the end of the programme.

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,640
Reporter William Lee Adams has been investigating the arguments for and against keeping animal

17
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,120
in zoos with BBC World Service programme What in the World. Here, he gives two arguments in favour of

18
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,040
Education is the primary reason that zoos give for why they should exist. The fact is,

19
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,439
school children all over the world are often bussed to zoos. I remember myself going to see

20
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,320
lowland gorillas at zoos at land every single year. And the point of this was to introduce us to

21
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,400
conservation One argument for keeping animals in zoos is to educate people about the importance of

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,360
conservation, the protection of plants, animals and the natural world from human damage.

23
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,520
A second point is that zoos often invest in research programmes that help endangered animals.

24
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,920
Now, as we know, pandas are notoriously reluctant to mate. The female pandas have a narrow window

25
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,000
of fertility. Their solitary creatures and it takes two to tango when it comes to reproduction.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,840
But a lot of money in zoos, it goes to sort of find ways to encourage these animals to mate.

27
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,720
A second argument is that zoos protects endangered species from extinction through breeding.

28
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,120
William mentions pandas, animals which are reluctant, meaning slow and unwilling to reproduce.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,920
Male and female pandas need a little help to make babies and zoos can provide this help.

30
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,920
William uses the idiom it takes two to tango to describe an activity which needs two people,

31
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,680
or in this case two pandas, to be willing to make something a success.

32
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,800
Now, let's turn to some of the arguments against zoos with Nikita Darwin,

33
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,240
a 19-year-old animal rights activist from India, who spoke to BBC World Service Program,

34
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,160
What in the World. I don't think zoos should exist for several reasons.

35
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,719
The first one being zoos' detrimental impact on both the physical and psychological

36
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:26,080
health of animals. Many studies and research have shown that many animals in zoos and aquariums

37
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,800
display abnormal behaviors like headballing, pacing, stereotypical behaviors, signs of mental distress.

38
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:39,200
The second reason I would say is that zoos cannot mimic the natural habitat of animals in the wild.

39
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,000
Nikita argues that being enclosed in a zoo is so stressful for wild animals,

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,680
it leads to abnormal behavior, behavior that is different and worse from what would normally be

41
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,240
expected. Examples of this include animals pacing their cages in circles and rocking,

42
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,800
barbiting, and even self-harm. And they're so common in captive animals,

43
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:07,360
there's a name for it, zoocosis. Even zoos with large enclosures can not fully mimic or copy

44
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,520
the natural habitats and open spaces these animals would enjoy in the wild. And imagine how a polar bear

45
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,400
evolved for life in the frozen Arctic would feel trapped in a zoo in a much warmer country.

46
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:25,120
Some zoologists have compared zoocosis to human traumas like post-traumatic stress disorder,

47
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,879
but say it's even more damaging. For captive animals, everything, including the air they breathe,

48
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,639
is traumatic. We've heard a few arguments for and against keeping animals in zoos. What do you think,

49
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,240
Neil? Have you changed your opinion at all? Well, I think there are really strong arguments on

50
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,079
both sides, so I'm still not sure, Georgie. Well, we know how some of the animals at the Sydney zoo

51
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:53,759
felt about things because they managed to escape. But what was the answer to your question, Neil?

52
00:04:53,839 --> 00:05:00,079
Well, Georgie, I asked you which animals escaped from a zoo in Sydney, Australia in 2022.

53
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:07,439
Was it A, elephants, B, lions or sea zebras? And I said zebras. I'm afraid. That was the wrong

54
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,879
answer. It was actually lions, how scary. Okay, it's time to recap the vocabulary we've learned.

55
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:18,159
Conservation is the protection of plants, animals and the natural world from human harm.

56
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:23,519
If you are reluctant to do something, you don't want to do it, or you do it very slowly.

57
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,519
The idiom it takes to tatango refers to an activity which needs two people to willingly and

58
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:35,279
actively take part for it to succeed. The adjective abnormal means different from what would normally

59
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:42,319
be expected in a bad way. Zucosis is a term to describe the repeated purposeless behavior performed

60
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:48,480
by captive animals in response to the stress of being confined, including pacing, head bobbing

61
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,960
and swaying. And finally, if you mimic somebody or something, you imitate it or copy it.

62
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,080
Once again, our six minutes are up, but don't forget we have a worksheet and a quiz that you can

63
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,400
use to practice the vocabulary from this episode. Visit BBCLearningEnglish.com. Goodbye for now.

64
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,040
Goodbye.
