00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,720
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,679
And I'm Neil and I feel terrible.

6
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:20,800
You look terrible Neil if you don't mind me saying so.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,640
Because I had to get up really early this morning.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,199
Oh dear, what time did you have to get up?

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,320
8 o'clock.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,200
Oh Neil, that isn't early. I get up at 6 every day.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
It's so peaceful early in the morning.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,719
Hmm. Well, some people are morning people and others.

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,120
Oh dear.

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,200
Yes, well today we are talking about the biological reason for this.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,519
It's all about circadian rhythms.

16
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,600
They're produced by a so-called body clock in our brains that

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,840
regulates our body functions.

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,399
Our body temperature, sleepiness,

19
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,840
under-learness, hunger and hormone levels,

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,519
plants, animals and many microbes have circadian rhythms.

21
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,159
You know a lot about circadian rhythms.

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,040
Hmm. And I'll ask you a question related to them.

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,000
What does the word circadian mean?

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,560
Is it A around a day, B every day or C twice a day?

25
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm going to say A around a day.

26
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,879
Well, we'll find out whether you got the answer right or not later on in the show.

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,439
Now let's talk about circadian rhythms and our internal clock.

28
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,159
Why do our bodies need an internal clock to tell us where we are in the day?

29
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,439
Isn't it obvious?

30
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,640
No, it isn't. Take jet lag for example.

31
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:48,800
We rely on the predictable cycle of light or dark in a 24-hour period to synchronise

32
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,599
or adjust our body clocks to the environment.

33
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,159
And if we mess about with the light and dark cycle by flying into a new time zone,

34
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,000
it makes us feel really bad.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,200
Good point. Jet lag is the disruption of our circadian rhythms caused by high speed travel

36
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,519
across different time zones, which can cause tiredness and sleep problems.

37
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:13,280
But Alice, if we rely on day turning tonight to adjust our body clocks, what happens to blind people?

38
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,000
Because I assume their body clocks can't do this.

39
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,879
Blind people who have some light perception are able to synchronise their circadian rhythms

40
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,240
to the light dark cycle.

41
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,879
But those who have no light perception at all, well, let's listen now to Deborah Schien,

42
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,800
professor of neuroendocrinology at the University of Surrey.

43
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,319
She can explain what happens.

44
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,920
Totally blind people.

45
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,120
They've lost that connection between the light dark cycle and the clock.

46
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,480
So there isn't anything wrong with the clock, but the clock ticks and oscillates

47
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,879
at its own endogenous period.

48
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,800
Just the same as if I were to put you in a dark cave.

49
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Your biological internal clock would oscillate at your endogenous circadian period.

50
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,879
So if you're totally blind or able to see but living in a dark cave,

51
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,800
you have a ticking clock, but with no connection to the outside world.

52
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,360
The clock oscillates at its own endogenous or internal period.

53
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,560
Oscillate means to move back and forth in a regular rhythm, like the pendulum on a clock.

54
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,000
Do you think my endogenous clock ticks faster than yours, Alice?

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,560
It isn't a competition meal.

56
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,879
And actually, mine probably ticks faster than yours since I'm a morning person.

57
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,599
Anyway, the normal range in humans is between 23.8 and 24.8 hours.

58
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,280
And this is also true for totally blind people.

59
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,799
But their clocks are free running.

60
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,400
They don't get cues from the outside environment telling them when to wake up,

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,319
when to eat, when to feel sleepy.

62
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,599
So that means they might feel sleepy at the wrong time of day,

63
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,159
for example, when they're at work, or alert in the middle of the night when they should be asleep.

64
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:04,000
It's worth talking about people who do shift work, which means work that takes place

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,639
outside the traditional 9-5 day.

66
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:12,319
Shift workers may suffer similar problems to blind people because they're trying to sleep against the clock.

67
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,959
They might sleep in the day and work at night, for example,

68
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,519
which goes against the light dark pattern.

69
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,599
There are some long-term health problems associated with shift work, too.

70
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:24,560
Certain cancers, heart disease and obesity.

71
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,839
So what can people do to help adapt their circadian rhythms to a night shift schedule?

72
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,719
Well, let's hear what Professor Debra Schien has to say about it.

73
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:41,040
We do think that exercise and food caffeine may be able to modulate in some way,

74
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:48,400
so it has some influence on circadian timing, but not as strongly as the light dark cycle.

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,080
So the strongest influence over our circadian rhythm is the light dark cycle.

76
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,200
We can't alter night and day after all.

77
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:03,199
Debra Schien says that other cues such as food and exercise will modulate or adjust the body

78
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,120
clock. So eating three well-balanced meals at regular times each day can help your body clock

79
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,319
adapt to an unusual schedule. Taking naps or short sleeps just before you start a night shift

80
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:19,759
can help you feel more alert and keeping to the same sleep schedule every day will also help.

81
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,759
And don't forget caffeine, my old friend. A cup of coffee works wonders for me in the morning.

82
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:36,480
Now remember I asked what does circadian mean? Is it A around a day, B every day, or C twice a day?

83
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:44,240
I said around a day. And you were right! Well done Neil! The term circadian comes from the Latin

84
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,839
circa meaning around or approximately and DM meaning day. Now let's hear the words we learned today.

85
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:01,199
They are circadian rhythms, synchronize, jet lag, oscillate, endogenous, shift work,

86
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:09,120
modulate, naps. That's the end of today's six minute English. Don't forget to join us again soon. Bye!
