4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,599
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,719
And I'm Rob.

6
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,800
So Rob, did you get the research done that I asked you to do over the weekend?

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,960
Oh, it was at the top of my to-do list.

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,519
But Sunday night came around so quickly,

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,719
and I just, uh, you know, I didn't get round to it.

10
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,640
Rob, if I'd known you weren't going to do the research, I'd have done it myself.

11
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,000
What did you actually do at the weekend anyway?

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,600
Oh, you know this and that.

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,719
It's funny how time slipped by without you noticing.

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,399
Mmm, yes. I bet you spent the whole weekend watching cat videos on YouTube

15
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,920
and googling your own name.

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,399
What's that? That's unfair and untrue, Alice.

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,399
Well, mostly untrue anyway.

18
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,799
I did some shopping and I fixed my bike as well as watching videos and googling myself.

19
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:06,640
Well, perhaps I should say at this point that today's show is about procrastination,

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,599
which means not doing something you're supposed to do.

21
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:13,039
Well, I do feel bad about my procrastination, actually.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,519
Oh, well, that's good to hear.

23
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,319
But let's move on now and hear today's quiz question.

24
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,039
Can you tell me which American said you made a lay,

25
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,560
but time will not.

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:33,200
Was it A, John F Kennedy, B, Benjamin Franklin, or C, Franklin Roosevelt?

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,640
Mmm, okay. I think I'll go for A, John F Kennedy, because I reckon he was good at making to-do lists

28
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,000
and then getting on with him.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,480
Haha, unlike somebody I could mention.

30
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,080
Alice, I thought we were going to move on.

31
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,760
All right, then.

32
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,320
Personally, I think it's important to try and understand why we procrastinate.

33
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,000
So let's hear from Daphna Oizerman, Professor of Psychology,

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,799
Communication and Education at the University of Southern California talking about this.

35
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,679
People spend most of their time focused on the present, which makes perfect sense,

36
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:10,079
because the present is now and for sure.

37
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:15,680
Unfortunately, many things that are quite important about the future require that we start

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,719
doing things now, rather than waiting for later to happen.

39
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,719
Things like saving for retirement, studying for college entry exams,

40
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,800
revising papers, preparing for work reports,

41
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,199
unfortunately, waiting to later means that we run out of time.

42
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:40,879
So we are too focused on the present and reluctant to engage in tasks that relate to the future.

43
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,000
Why is that, Rob?

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,079
Well, like Professor Oizerman says, things in the future may never happen,

45
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,120
or seem too far off for you to take seriously.

46
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,480
For example, when you're young, sorting out a pension plan doesn't feel like a priority,

47
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,800
or something that's more important than other things.

48
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,840
But according to a new study, if you think about time in smaller units,

49
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,120
so days, for example, rather than months or years,

50
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,439
you are likely to start a task more quickly.

51
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,720
Hmm, so this weekend I wasted two days.

52
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,840
Hmm, or 2,880 minutes.

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,360
Ooh, that does sound more urgent when you put it like that.

54
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,400
Yes, and you need to minimise or reduce distractions.

55
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,199
Turn off your tech and knuckle down to your tasks, Rob.

56
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,480
To knuckle down, by the way, means to start working hard.

57
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,080
But Alice, sometimes it's hard to knuckle down to a task when you don't know how to start it,

58
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,599
or you're scared to start it, or sometimes just because you know it's going to be really tedious.

59
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,400
That means boring.

60
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,280
Hmm, yes.

61
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,039
So what's your excuse, Rob?

62
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,560
Well, it's boredom usually.

63
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,679
You should try temptation bundling.

64
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:49,599
Temptation bundling, what's that?

65
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,479
Hmm, temptation bundling means doing two activities together.

66
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:56,719
One you should do, but are avoiding,

67
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,599
and one you love doing, which isn't productive.

68
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,639
Hmm, for example, eating biscuits while I work?

69
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,919
Yes, that's right.

70
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,680
That sounds like a good one for you, Rob.

71
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,519
It might be a good idea, actually.

72
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,560
Well, let's listen to Dr. Catherine Love Day talking about

73
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,080
how we often underestimate how long things will take us.

74
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,600
There's this thing called the planning fallacy.

75
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,959
My favourite one is always the example of the Oxford English Dictionary

76
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,439
that they started in 1857, and it was supposed to take five years,

77
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,759
but five years later they'd only got to the word ant.

78
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,560
In the end, it took another 70 years, and then it was update,

79
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,079
and they had to start to get anywhere.

80
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,279
We never seem to get any better at judging time in the future,

81
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,399
and how long things will take us.

82
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,439
That's Dr. Catherine Love Day.

83
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,000
So what's a fallacy, Alice?

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,719
It's a mistaken belief or idea.

85
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,319
And for the famous Oxford English Dictionary,

86
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,319
their mistake was to think they would get the work done in five years

87
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,319
when it actually took 70.

88
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,079
Gosh, wow, what a long time.

89
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,279
And talking about time, ours is running out.

90
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,680
Let's go back to today's quiz question.

91
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,480
I asked, which American said you made a law, but time will not?

92
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:15,200
Was it A, John F. Kennedy, B, Benjamin Franklin, or C, Franklin Roosevelt?

93
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,800
And I very confidently said John F. Kennedy.

94
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,120
Yes, you did, and you were wrong today, Rob Unfraid.

95
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,680
It was Benjamin Franklin, one of the founding fathers of the United States.

96
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,680
Franklin was a leading author, printer, political theorist, politician,

97
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,560
free Mason, postmaster, scientist, inventor, civic activist,

98
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,639
statesman, and diplomat.

99
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,959
I doubt he wasted much time procrastinating.

100
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,360
No, okay, without further delay, here are the words we learned today.

101
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:58,000
Procrastination, priority, minimize, knuckle down, tedious,

102
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,800
temptation bundling, fallacy.

103
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,160
Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
