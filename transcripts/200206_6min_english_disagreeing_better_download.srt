4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,240
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,199
And I'm Rob.

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,879
In this programme, we'll be talking about disagreeing.

7
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:22,400
Er, no, we won't.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,519
I think we will, Rob. We're discussing the following.

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,519
Is it good to disagree?

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,199
I know, but I feel better for having that little disagreement.

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,840
So that proves it is good to disagree.

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,719
Well, I hate to disagree, but I think we should explore the subject a little further first

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,920
in the next 6 minutes.

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,920
Er, shouldn't that be 5 minutes?

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,719
Oh, Rob.

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,920
You're being pedantic, focusing too much on the small details or formal rules.

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,200
Maybe we should agree to disagree and move on to the quiz question.

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,560
I like to set every week.

19
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,920
Yes, a good idea.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,280
Okay, so do you know which spiritual leader is famous for saying

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,280
disagreement is something normal?

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,879
Is it a, Pope Francis, b, the Dalai Lama, or c, Ravi Shankar?

23
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:10,960
Hmm, that's tricky.

24
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,240
So I'll have a guess and say b, the Dalai Lama.

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,120
Okay, I'll let you know if that was correct at the end of the programme.

26
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,920
But whoever said disagreement is something normal is probably right.

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,719
I'm sure we all disagree with someone about something.

28
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:25,920
Don't we, Rob?

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,240
No.

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,400
Ah, just joking.

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,480
Of course, disagreeing is normal.

32
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,280
It will be boring if we agreed about everything.

33
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,159
However, I guess agreement on some things may have prevented a few wars.

34
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,040
Indeed.

35
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,840
But it is a fascinating subject and it's something the BBC Radio 4 programme

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,480
a guide to disagreeing better looked at.

37
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,719
I think we should hear about how not to disagree first.

38
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,200
This is Couples Therapist, author and speaker Esther Perel,

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,120
who knows a thing or two about that.

40
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,400
In a battle, you position yourself in a hierarchy.

41
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,560
One is on top of the other.

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,560
And then there is arguing that comes with a contempt

43
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,199
in which it's not just that I don't accept your point of view,

44
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,599
is that I actually really think you're a lesser human being.

45
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,240
Right, so Esther explains that bad disagreement is a battle.

46
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,000
One person tries to take a higher position in the hierarchy.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,320
A hierarchy is a way of organising people according to their importance.

48
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,040
So a disagreement doesn't go well if one person thinks they're more important than someone else.

49
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,600
And according to Esther, things also don't go well if someone has contempt,

50
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,160
which is a dislike or lack of respect for someone or something.

51
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,000
And contempt in a bad disagreement can be more than just not liking somebody's point of view.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,840
Their perspective on something.

53
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,120
It could be thinking someone is a lesser human being.

54
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,639
Out, that's not nice.

55
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,400
Let's think more about good disagreement.

56
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,680
The BBC podcast, seriously, has listed some tips for disagreeing better,

57
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,639
including not aiming for the middle ground.

58
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,199
Another way of saying, compromising.

59
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,680
It also suggests speaking truthfully, listening intently,

60
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,800
that means giving all your attention to what's being said,

61
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,880
and aiming for empathy, but not feeling at the end of a disagreement that you have to agree.

62
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,600
I agree, and I'm sure former British politician Douglas Alexander would too.

63
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,960
He presented the programme, a guide to disagreeing better,

64
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,680
and explained why he thought disagreeing is a good thing.

65
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,600
The couple of decades I spent as an elected politician

66
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,080
convinced me that disagreement is necessary if society is to progress.

67
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,800
And a society that values civility over justice and truth

68
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,040
would simply be a recipe for stagnation.

69
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,400
But honest conversations involve listening intently,

70
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,320
as well as speaking truthfully.

71
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,280
The thoughts of Douglas Alexander there, who through his work as a politician

72
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,760
is convinced that disagreement is a good thing.

73
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,680
He says we shouldn't just follow the values of civility,

74
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,520
that means polite behaviour.

75
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:19,599
It's important to challenge and question thoughts and ideas.

76
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:21,839
Not just be polite and accept them.

77
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,719
Yes, and if we don't challenge things and search for truth and justice,

78
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:29,199
he feels it would lead to stagnation,

79
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,360
staying the same and not developing.

80
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,759
The verb form is too stagnate.

81
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,719
But he does say that when we discuss things and disagree,

82
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:40,560
we must be honest, listen to the other person intently,

83
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,319
and speak truthfully.

84
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,759
But I would add that this should be done politely and with respect.

85
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,439
Well Sam, I've been listening to you intently,

86
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,159
and if I'm honest, I think it's about time you gave me the answer to today's question.

87
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,759
We can agree on that, Rob.

88
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,959
So earlier I asked you if you knew which spiritual leader is famous for saying

89
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,199
disagreement is something normal.

90
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,120
Is it A, Pope Francis, B, the Dalai Lama,

91
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,240
or C, Ravi Shankar, and Rob, what did you say?

92
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,399
I said it's B, the Dalai Lama.

93
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,000
And you were right, well done.

94
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,759
Now, if you'll agree, could we recap some of the vocabulary we've discussed in this program?

95
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,319
Of course. First of all, I was accused of being pedantic,

96
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,759
focusing too much on the small details or formal rules.

97
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,680
Then we mentioned hierarchy.

98
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,120
This is a way of organising people, according to their importance.

99
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,000
Contempt is a dislike or lack of respect for something or someone.

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,759
A point of view describes someone's perspective on something.

101
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,120
Your point of view might be different from my point of view.

102
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,159
Indeed. And we also mentioned civility, which means polite behaviour.

103
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:54,000
And stagnation means staying the same and not developing.

104
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,360
Would you agree, Sam?

105
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,639
You are right, Rob.

106
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,920
And that brings us to the end of our discussion about disagreeing.
