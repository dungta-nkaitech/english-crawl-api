00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,919
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:13,280
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,439
Happy Birthday to you.

5
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:17,440
Happy Birthday to you.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,400
Happy Birthday to Neil.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,640
Happy Birthday to you.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,280
Um, thank you, Beth, but it's not my birthday.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:33,840
I know, but this programme is all about birthdays or birthday cakes to be precise.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,960
Ah, yes. The highlight of any birthday party is the birthday cake,

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,840
blowing out the candles and making a wish.

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,159
Right. But things have changed a lot from the days when most birthday cakes were homemade,

13
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:54,960
made at home and not bought from a shop. Nowadays, many birthday cakes are works of art,

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:02,960
extravagant, edible creations designed and decorated to represent the person celebrating their birthday.

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,840
In this programme, we'll be hearing from two bakers, a famous TV chef who bakes simple but tasty cakes

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,400
and another who's designed personalised birthday cakes for celebrities,

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,799
including Arnold Schwarzenegger.

18
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,719
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

19
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,879
Sounds good, but first I have a question for you, Neil.

20
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,680
Everyone looks forward to their birthday, especially if there's cake.

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:37,120
But according to the UK's Office for National Statistics, which is the most common month to be born?

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,920
Is it A, March, B, July or C, September?

23
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,920
Hmm, that's an interesting question and I'm going to guess it's September.

24
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,280
Okay, Neil, I'll reveal the answer at the end of the programme.

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,400
One of Britain's best-loved cake bakers is Dame Mary Berry.

26
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,799
Here she describes her perfect birthday cake to BBC Radio 4's The Food programme.

27
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:12,879
My perfect cake would be something in lemon or orange because those are my favourite flavours.

28
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,360
I don't mind how hegelty pickled theatres don't take a long time to do

29
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,640
but beautifully fresh and beautifully flavoured simple.

30
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,200
Mary Berry thinks a simple birthday cake is best.

31
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,880
She doesn't mind if the decoration is hegelty-piggyly mixed up and in no particular order.

32
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,440
Yes, when it comes to birthday cakes, flavour is more important than decoration for Dame Mary Berry.

33
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,360
But now a new generation of bakers is making cakes in a totally different way.

34
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:53,200
The cakes Adam Cox makes in his East London bakery are truly fantastic looking creations.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,920
Here's Adam speaking to BBC Radio 4's The Food programme.

36
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:05,920
I get asked to do all sorts like my customers and clients are very generous with the leeway

37
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,720
that they give me based on the past designs that I've made that they've seen so they're happy

38
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:17,120
to just leave it with me. I really just want to create something that will last long in the memory

39
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:24,240
for the person that I do it for. It's a real pleasure to have this as a job because, as I say,

40
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:32,319
it gives me a lot of freedom to express myself creatively. So I really try and go above and beyond

41
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:39,280
to give the client something that they will be really happy with.

42
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:46,640
Adam gets asked to make all sorts, meaning many different kinds of cakes. His customers,

43
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,920
who want the cake to be a special part of a birthday party, give him lots of leeway,

44
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,920
lots of freedom to make the cake the way he wants to. Adam finds out about the person's interests

45
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:05,920
and hobbies and uses these to come up with decoration ideas. Adam loves his job. It gives him the freedom

46
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:12,719
to express himself creatively and he enjoys seeing his customers reaction when the finished cake

47
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:21,120
is revealed. Adam goes above and beyond to satisfy his customers. If you go above and beyond,

48
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,759
you do something with more effort than would normally be expected.

49
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,519
And the results of Adam's extra effort, birthday cakes which last long in the memory,

50
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:36,799
a phrase describing something which creates such a strong impression that it's remembered for a

51
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:42,959
long time. Or at least until the following year when another birthday comes around and it's time

52
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:48,879
to start baking all over again. And speaking of birthdays coming around, what was the answer to your

53
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:56,000
question, Beth? You asked me which was the most common month to be born in the UK. And you guessed it

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,680
was September, which was the correct answer. Babies born in the UK peak in September,

55
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,759
right? Let's recap the vocabulary from this programme starting with Home Made, an adjective

56
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,759
describing something which is made at home and not bought from a shop. If something is higgledy

57
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:22,560
piggledy, it's mixed up and in no particular order. The phrase all sorts means many different

58
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,920
kinds of something, like the sweets called licoriceal sorts which come in different shapes and

59
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:34,639
colours. If someone gives you leeway to do something, they give you the freedom to do it the way you

60
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:41,519
want to. The idiom to last long in the memory means to create such a strong effect that it's

61
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:47,840
remembered for a long time. And finally, when someone goes above and beyond, they do something with

62
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:54,479
much more effort than would usually be expected. Once again, our six minutes are up. If your birthdays

63
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,759
coming up, we hope you have a cake with candles and make a wish to join us again soon for more
