Hello, I'm Neil and welcome to 6 Minute English

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,839
where we bring you an interesting topic and six related items of vocabulary.

7
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,240
But there should be two of us and my co-presenter Rob hasn't arrived.

8
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,240
Rob, Rob, you're late.

9
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:29,839
Am I?

10
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:31,279
What's the time?

11
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:32,719
It's time to start the show.

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,320
Do you actually own a watch?

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,320
No, I rely on my internal clock.

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,519
It's pretty good.

15
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:39,119
Er, no, it isn't.

16
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,159
You're late.

17
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:41,359
But I'm usually on time.

18
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:46,799
Now, today we're talking about what would happen to the world if all the clocks stopped.

19
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,599
It seems like that wouldn't worry you too much, Rob.

20
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:50,560
You're right.

21
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,159
I think we're slaves to time.

22
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,159
We've got digital clocks on everything.

23
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,959
Smartphones, computers, microwaves, bus stops.

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,039
It's hard to get away from it.

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,439
Did you know the word time is the most common noun in the English language,

26
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,439
according to the Oxford English Dictionary?

27
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,439
Oh, well, I didn't know that, Rob.

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,439
But good timekeeping is extremely important.

29
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,439
There are so many things to share during a day and so many deadlines to meet.

30
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,439
Tick tock, tick tock.

31
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,640
Well, before we run out of time, Neil, and that means use it all up,

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,159
let's have a quiz question.

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,159
Can you tell me what the word clock originally referred to?

34
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,000
Is it a appendulum?

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,200
Be a bell or see a dial?

36
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,960
A pendulum is a stick with a weight on the end that swings regularly from side to side.

37
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,519
And a dial is the round part of a clock,

38
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,599
but there are dials on loads of things.

39
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,280
They aren't just on clocks.

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,680
And a bell is, well, a bell.

41
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,719
Well, hurry up, Neil.

42
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,200
You're wasting time with all these explanations.

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,799
That's cheeky coming from you, Rob.

44
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,120
I think the answer is probably bell.

45
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,600
Well, you could be right, because not all timepieces go tick tock.

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,040
In fact, mechanical clocks and watches are quite recent in the history of timekeeping.

47
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,840
Mechanical means to do with machines.

48
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,280
So in the past, before people had mechanical timepieces,

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,439
how did they know when to arrive at work, for example, or when to finish?

50
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,200
They would have looked up at the sky and observed how the position of the sun,

51
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,159
the moon and the stars changed as time passed.

52
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,840
That doesn't sound very precise.

53
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,560
Precisely.

54
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,719
It means accurate or exact.

55
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,360
It was precise enough for many people.

56
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,840
Let's listen to the director of the museum of the history of science in Oxford,

57
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,480
Dr. Silke Ackerman, talking about this.

58
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:45,520
We certainly gain precision, but we completely get devolved or divorced from where time

59
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,960
originally came from.

60
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,159
The time we use was based on the movement of the sun.

61
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:58,879
And it's roughly still in sync, but for many societies, it wasn't at all relevant to know

62
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,240
that it's four o'clock.

63
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,960
They needed to know how much daylight have I got left or when is the prayer time I need to observe

64
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,759
for completely different reasons.

65
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,879
And whilst precision is wonderful, it's also very much a straight jacket.

66
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:21,039
Everybody is dominated by looking at the watch or smartphone all the time when you observe people.

67
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:23,120
So we've basically become a slave to time.

68
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,280
So in the past, they had different reasons for wanting to know the time, is that it?

69
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,719
Yes. In ancient times, people were concerned about the changing of the seasons and how this affected them.

70
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,359
When it was time to plant crops or when to harvest them, when the rainy season was going to start.

71
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:44,479
Now you mention it in the Muslim world, the start of Ramadan is traditionally calculated

72
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,759
by the rising of the present moon, which changes every year.

73
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,840
And you can't calculate that with modern methods of timekeeping.

74
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,439
You're catching on Neil.

75
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,439
Now what does Dr. Akhamam mean when she says precision is a straight jacket?

76
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:03,359
She means that always wanting to be precise about time can limit what we do in a way that is damaging.

77
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:06,399
So we need to take our time, relax a bit.

78
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:08,319
That's my philosophy for life.

79
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,719
But we are seriously running out of time now Rob.

80
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,759
So please hurry up and tell us the answer to today's quiz question.

81
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,639
Okay, well the answer is bell, so you are right Neil.

82
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,599
The word clock is derived from the Celtic words Claggen and clocker, meaning bell.

83
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,719
A silent instrument that doesn't have a bell has traditionally been known as a timepiece.

84
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,920
But today, a clock refers to any device for measuring and displaying the time.

85
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,680
Well moving on quickly, let's go through the words we learned today.

86
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,800
First up was run out of time or use it all up.

87
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,959
You can run out of pretty much anything.

88
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:44,879
Oh no, we've run out of sugar.

89
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,560
Who's going to the shop to buy some more?

90
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,799
Number two pendulum.

91
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:54,399
A stick with a weight on the end that swings regularly from side to side controlling the movement of a clock.

92
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,199
The pendulum on my grandfather clock has stopped swinging.

93
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,159
Sorry to hear that Rob.

94
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,399
Number three, a dial is the round part of a clock.

95
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,799
But more generally refers to a round instrument that shows you the amount of something.

96
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:09,199
For example, heat, pressure or speed.

97
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,399
The hands move slowly around the clock dial.

98
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,799
Fones used to have dials that you'd turn to make a phone call.

99
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:17,680
Here's the verb.

100
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,159
I dialed his number but he didn't answer.

101
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,399
Alfred Hitchcock made a film called dial M for murder.

102
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:28,719
Okay, number four is mechanical to do with machines.

103
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:32,639
Our plane was delayed because of a mechanical problem.

104
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:36,879
Number five, precise, which means accurate and exact.

105
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,799
So what type of mechanical problem could you be more precise, Rob?

106
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,479
No, I don't have time Neil.

107
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,400
Number six is straight jacket, which means limiting what somebody can do in a way that is damaging.

108
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,160
It's also a jacket with long arms that are tied behind a person to stop them from behaving violently.

109
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,759
Oh no, not the straight jacket.

110
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,680
I promise I'll behave myself Neil.

111
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,360
Okay, if you really promise Rob.

112
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,680
Right, well we've run out of time.

113
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,360
Please check our Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages.

114
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,000
Goodbye.

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,400
Bye-bye.

116
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,720
Don't English from the BBC.
