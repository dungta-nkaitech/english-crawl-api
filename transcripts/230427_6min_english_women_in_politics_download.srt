00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:17,160
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Beth.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,640
And I'm Neil.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,240
Differences between men and women have existed forever.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,000
But in modern times,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,839
imbalances in the opportunities for men and women have widened.

8
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:32,880
One area where this imbalance is widest is politics.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,200
When we think of female politicians,

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,280
the names Margaret Thatcher, Angle and Miracle,

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,640
Indira Gandhi or Jussandr Ardern all come to mind.

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,879
But while women make up over half the world's population,

13
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,200
only 26% of the world's politicians are women.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,200
How much of this is because of misogyny,

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,840
hatred and prejudice against women?

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,680
It seems that the surprise resignation of New Zealand's Prime Minister,

17
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,120
Jussandr Ardern, was partly because of the misogynistic abuse she received online.

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,600
So in this programme, we'll be asking,

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,000
why is life so hard for women in politics?

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,800
And of course, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,080
But before that, I have a question for you, Neil.

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,680
Britain has had three female prime ministers all from the Conservative Party.

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,400
First was Margaret Thatcher, who was followed in 2016 by Theresa May,

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,400
and after that by Liz Truss,

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,120
who resigned after only a short time in office.

26
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,200
But for how long exactly was Liz Truss Prime Minister?

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,880
Was it A45 days, B1 year and 45 days,

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,880
or C2 years and 45 days?

29
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,680
I think the answer is 45 days.

30
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,320
OK, Neil, I'll reveal the answer later.

31
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,839
One of the biggest barriers for female politicians

32
00:01:56,839 --> 00:02:01,239
is that politics has traditionally been seen as a man's world.

33
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:05,119
When Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister in 1979,

34
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,239
she had to manage a group of men

35
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:10,759
who were not used to being told what to do by a woman.

36
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,799
Here, Professor Rosie Campbell,

37
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:16,359
director of the Global Institute for Women's Leadership,

38
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:20,479
explains to BBC World Service programme The Real Story,

39
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:25,199
how Mrs Thatcher's solution to this problem was to appear more masculine.

40
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,879
She was deliberately coached to change her voice

41
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:31,879
and to behave in a way that was more stereotypically masculine.

42
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:35,639
At the same time as presenting herself in terms of her attire

43
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,079
in a very feminine way,

44
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:39,879
which really showed the typework that she had to walk

45
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:42,759
in order to seem strong enough to be the leader,

46
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:46,039
but not subverting norms of what it is to be a woman.

47
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:49,199
So I think whatever you might think of Margaret Thatcher,

48
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,959
that was a very challenging typework that she had to do.

49
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,759
Margaret Thatcher was coached to behave more like a man,

50
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,319
for example, by lowering her voice.

51
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:02,239
If you are coached, you are specially trained

52
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,879
in how to improve at a particular skill.

53
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,560
At the same time, she was also advised to appear feminine,

54
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,879
especially in her attire the clothes she wore.

55
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,879
In trying to present both male and female sides of herself,

56
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:18,359
Mrs Thatcher walked a tightrope.

57
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,600
An idiom meaning to be in a difficult situation

58
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,440
that requires carefully considered behaviour.

59
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,400
The point is that none of these demands were made of the men

60
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,440
in Mrs Thatcher's government.

61
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,280
Even today, the way women in politics behave or dress

62
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,800
is commented on and criticised far more than men,

63
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,080
with the result that fewer women are willing to expose themselves

64
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,680
to public scrutiny,

65
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,400
a situation which has only got worse since the internet,

66
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,360
and with it sexist and misogynistic abuse on social media.

67
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,280
Paradoxically, it's often said that the qualities of empathy

68
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,319
and understanding, often associated with women,

69
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,759
are most needed in politics today.

70
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:01,719
According to former Prime Minister Helen Clark,

71
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,200
who was New Zealand's first female elected leader,

72
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,759
it's not just that women are more caring.

73
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,200
They also bring a different leadership style,

74
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,200
as she explained to BBC World Service programme, The Real Story.

75
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,759
I think that women are known for more collaborative styles

76
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,279
in politics, less likely to be the top-down heavy-handed,

77
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,279
you know, my way all the highway,

78
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,639
more open to evidence, debate.

79
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,759
I think it certainly informed the way that I led.

80
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:37,879
I think it also informed the priorities that I had.

81
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,599
Helen Clark believes women leaders are more collaborative.

82
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,840
They prefer working cooperatively with several people

83
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,879
to achieve a common goal.

84
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,920
She contrasts this with a stricter, more dictatorial leadership style

85
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,360
by using the expression,

86
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,520
my way or the highway,

87
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,760
an idiom used as a warning that someone will only accept their way of doing things.

88
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,760
In fact, adopting such dictatorial approaches

89
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,600
has been the end of many political leaders,

90
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,560
including Mrs. Thatcher and more recently Liz Truss,

91
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,800
which brings me back to my question, Neil,

92
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,000
how long did Liz Truss last as Prime Minister?

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,120
I guess it was 45 days. Was I right?

94
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,280
That was the correct answer.

95
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,879
Liz Truss was Prime Minister for just 45 days,

96
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:29,319
the shortest premiership of any British leader ever, male or female.

97
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,680
OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt in this programme

98
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,360
on women in politics, starting with misogyny,

99
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,959
the dislike or hatred of women.

100
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,719
If you are coached in something,

101
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:45,199
you are trained or instructed in how to improve that particular skill.

102
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,039
A tire means the clothes you are wearing.

103
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:50,279
If you have to walk a tightrope,

104
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:54,120
you're in a difficult situation that requires careful behaviour.

105
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,319
The adjective collaborative involves several people working together

106
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,759
for a particular purpose.

107
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,359
And finally, the idiom,

108
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:03,439
it's my way or the highway,

109
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:08,679
can be used as a warning that someone will only accept their own way of doing things.

110
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,400
Once again, our six minutes are up.

111
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,720
See you soon. Bye.
