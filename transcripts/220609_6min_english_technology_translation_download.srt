Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Rob.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,679
And I'm Sam. Rob, I'm writing a letter to a friend in Spain and I need some help.

5
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,560
Do you know the Spanish for its raining?

6
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:32,239
Don't worry, I have this new app. I just hold up my phone, scan the word I want translated.

7
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,320
Esther Yoviendo is the Spanish for its raining.

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,200
Amazing. In this programme, we're discussing language technologies,

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,399
computers that can translate between languages.

10
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,759
Modern software like Google Translate has transformed how we learn foreign languages.

11
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,879
Bringing us closer to a world where language is no longer a barrier to communication.

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,120
How well do these computers know what we really mean to say?

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,079
Well, later we'll find out exactly what machines can and can't translate.

14
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,040
And, as usual, we'll be learning some new vocabulary as well.

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,439
But first, I have a question for you, Sam. The translation app I use just now is very recent.

16
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,760
But there's a long history of computer mis-translations, times when computers got it badly wrong.

17
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,800
In 1987, the American airline Braniff ran television adverts promoting the all-leather seats

18
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:33,280
installed on their flights to Mexico. But how was its fly-in leather advertising slogan

19
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,800
mis-translated into Spanish? Did the adverts say,

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,560
A, fly in lava? B, fly on a cow? Or C, fly naked?

21
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,360
Hmm, I have a feeling it might be C, fly naked.

22
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,040
Okay, Sam, I'll reveal the correct answer later in the program.

23
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,680
Computer software used to rely on rules-based translation,

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,239
applying the grammar rules of one language to another.

25
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,400
That work fine for simple words and phrases, but what happens when a translator comes across

26
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,240
more complex language? For example, metaphors, expressions used to describe one thing

27
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,159
by comparing it to another.

28
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,400
Lane Green is a language journalist and the author of the book,

29
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,879
Talk on the Wild Side. Here he explains to BBC Radio 4 program, Word of Mouth,

30
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,079
how apps like Google Translate allow users to manually translate metaphors.

31
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,120
If I say it's raining cats and dogs, and it literally translates Estadio Yendo,

32
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,759
Berros Yatos in Spanish, that won't make any sense. But I think somebody at Google will have

33
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,239
inputted the phrase, yo, yo he accantaros, which is the phrase,

34
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,039
it's raining pictures or it's raining jugs of water, so that the whole chunk,

35
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:54,319
raining cats and dogs, is translated into the equivalent metaphor in Spanish.

36
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,959
Lane wants to translate the phrase, it's raining cats and dogs,

37
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,560
something that people sometimes say when it's raining heavily.

38
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,000
It wouldn't make sense to translate this phrase into another language literally, word by word.

39
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,439
One solution is to translate the whole idiom as a chunk or a large part of text or language.

40
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,960
This works for phrases and idioms that people regularly use in the same way,

41
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,000
because they can be taught to a computer. But what happens when someone like a poet

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,199
writes a completely new sentence which has never been written before?

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,159
Lane Green thinks that even the smartest software couldn't deal with that,

44
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,120
as he told Michael Rosen, poet and presenter of BBC Radio 4's Word of Mouth.

45
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:11,199
With our brief red dot, Gordexes can try to come up with phrases that will flimax the computer

46
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:17,920
and so keep our jobs. When we say machines learn a language, we really mean they have been trained

47
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:24,639
to identify patterns in millions and millions of translations. Computers can only learn by

48
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,480
wrote, by memory, in order to repeat information rather than to properly understand it.

49
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,200
This kind of wrote learning can be easily automated, done by machines instead of humans.

50
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,360
But it's completely different from human learning requiring creative thinking,

51
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,680
which would flimax or confuse even the most sophisticated machine.

52
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,480
Bad news for translation software, but good news for humans who use different languages in their jobs,

53
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,520
like us. Yes, if only Branif Airlines had relied on human translators,

54
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,560
they might have avoided an embarrassing situation. Ah, in your question, you asked how

55
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:10,000
Branif's television advertisement Fly in Leather was translated into Spanish. I guess it was

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,439
mis-translated as Fly Naked. Which was the correct answer? Branif translated its Fly in

57
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,359
Leather slogan as Fly in Quero, which sounds like Spanish slang for Fly Naked.

58
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,960
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from this program about language translations,

59
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,720
which are automated, done by machines instead of humans.

60
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,400
Often found in poetry, a metaphor is a way of describing something by reference to something else.

61
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,800
When it's raining heavily, you might use the idiom, it's raining cats and dogs.

62
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,759
A chunk is a large part of something.

63
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:54,319
Wrote learning involves memorising information which you repeat, but don't really understand.

64
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,000
And finally, if someone is flummoxed, they're so confused that they don't know what to do.
