00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,800
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish, I'm Phil.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,080
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,640
If you use the internet and nearly everyone does, you've probably read headlines like this.

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,280
You won't believe what plastic surgery this celebrity has had done.

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:31,600
Known as clickbait, headlines like these are used to grab your attention and make you read more.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,640
But now a new trend called ragebait is spreading across social media.

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,920
Ragebait is online content designed to make you angry or outraged.

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,600
In this programme we'll explore the trend of ragebaiting and as usual we'll learn some useful

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,280
new vocabulary, all of which you can find on our website, BBCLearningEnglish.com.

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,760
Great, but first it's time for my question, Beth, which is about the two terms we've been using.

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:07,359
Clickbait and ragebait. Both contain the word bait. But what is his actual meaning?

13
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,120
Is bait a strong feeling of anger?

14
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,599
Be food, put on a hook to catch fish or animals or see a piece of computer software.

15
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,760
I am fairly confident that it is bait food, put on a hook.

16
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,080
Okay, well we'll find out the correct answer later in the programme.

17
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,960
Here's how ragebait works. A creator posts a provocative piece of content online,

18
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,360
a message maybe or a video, people see it, feel outraged and comment angrily.

19
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,480
Others see it, like it and share it around. On either way the content creates interest,

20
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,680
increases internet traffic and makes money for the creator.

21
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,040
Here's marketing strategist Andrea Jones explaining more to Megan Lawton,

22
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,640
presenter of BBC World Service programme Business Daily.

23
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,200
The more content they create, the more engagement they get, the more that they get paid.

24
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,879
And so they will do anything, some creators will do anything to get more views because the more views

25
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:16,319
they get, the more that they get paid, even if those views are negative or inciting rage and anger.

26
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:22,159
Andrea, how is ragebait different to clickbait or other online tactics?

27
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:27,120
As a marketer, I'm always coaching my clients and talking to them about using hooks in their

28
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,959
marketing, right? And I think the difference between a hook and ragebait or even it's a long-lost

29
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:39,120
cousin clickbait content, when we think about a hook, to me a hook accurately reflects what's in

30
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,159
that piece of content. And it comes from a place of trust, whereas ragebaiting content is designed

31
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:54,240
to be manipulative. Andrea says the more reaction a post gets, the more money the creator makes,

32
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,400
even if the reactions are hateful. She uses the structure, the more one thing happens,

33
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,319
the more something else happens, to show that as one thing happens repeatedly, another thing

34
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:12,639
increases as a result. For example, the more you practise English, the more you'll improve.

35
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:18,319
It doesn't matter that the content is designed to incite outrage, to encourage unpleasant or violent

36
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:25,439
reactions. That's why Andrea thinks ragebait is worse than clickbait. While clickbait is more

37
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:32,479
truthful about its content, ragebait is manipulative, meaning it tries to influence something to its

38
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:39,519
own advantage. So it's not hard to see why many people think ragebait is toxic. So if you're

39
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:46,640
wondering why people react in the first place, listen as Dr. William Brady explains the psychology

40
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:54,320
behind ragebait to BBC World Services business daily. If you are an influencer and you want to

41
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:00,160
figure out, well, how do I get more eyeballs on my content? Well, you need to exploit those biases

42
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,120
we have in our psychology, because that's the content we'll pay more attention to. In turn,

43
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,000
that's the content that algorithms will amplify, which ultimately means more advertising revenue.

44
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:18,399
Influences want more eyeballs on their content, more people to view their website or social media posts,

45
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:25,680
and use human psychology to do it. Psychologically speaking, we all have biases. Feelings which are

46
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:33,280
often unconscious, either for or against a certain idea or group of people. Biasis are emotional,

47
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,639
and since listening to our emotions has been vital to the evolution of the human species,

48
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,479
creators know that provoking our emotions will grab our attention.

49
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:50,079
So what can be done to combat ragebait? Well, we could all take a moment to think before reacting,

50
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,079
and remember that by sharing something outrageous, you might be making things worse,

51
00:04:54,799 --> 00:05:00,239
while also making the creator richer. Okay, Phil, let's reveal the answer to your question. You

52
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:07,920
asked me what bait is. I did. And the correct answer is B. Food put on a hook to catch a fish or

53
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,960
an animal. Isn't that what you said, Ben? It is, yes. Right again. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary

54
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,519
we've learnt in the programme, starting with ragebait. Social media content designed to provoke

55
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:28,639
anger, thereby encouraging people to engage with it. The structure, the more, the more, describes

56
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,479
the situation when one thing happening repeatedly results in another thing happening too.

57
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:41,439
To incite someone means to encourage them to do or feel something unpleasant or violent.

58
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:47,519
The adjective manipulative describes trying to influence or control someone to your own advantage.

59
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:53,519
Eyeballs is an informal word for the number of people viewing a particular website or television

60
00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:00,879
programme. And finally, biases are feelings, often unconscious, either for or against an idea

61
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,919
or a group of people. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now. Bye.
