00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,120
Hello and welcome to 6-Minute English from BBC Learning English.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,759
I'm Neil and today I'm here with Hannah from BBC Podcast What in the World. Hello Hannah.

4
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,760
Hi Neil.

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,719
Hannah and the What in the World team have been investigating what it's like to learn multiple languages

6
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,320
and she's here to tell us more about it. Welcome to 6-Minute English.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,000
Thank you so much for having me.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,679
And it's great to have you here.

9
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:35,039
Now in this programme we help you improve your English and maybe English is the first language

10
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,519
you have ever tried to learn or maybe you know a lot of languages.

11
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:44,240
Well someone who knows multiple languages is called a polyglot.

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,239
Neil, are you a polyglot?

13
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,519
I speak a little bit of a few languages but I couldn't say that I'm a polyglot.

14
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:52,480
How about you?

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,480
I am a polyglot.

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,159
Well I feel really impressed and a bit intimidating.

17
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,159
And now Hannah we always start our programme off with a question.

18
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,159
So here it goes.

19
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,200
Which country has the most official languages recognised by their government?

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,920
So is it a Zimbabwe, B Switzerland or C Bolivia?

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,239
I would guess Zimbabwe.

22
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,280
Well we'll find out the answer at the end of the programme.

23
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,599
Now Hannah, you've been finding out about some of the benefits of being a polyglot.

24
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:31,280
Yes Neil, there's been lots of research about how knowing more than one language can change your brain.

25
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,000
And this might have some health benefits too.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,439
At What in the World we spoke to Professor Frederick Liegeau,

27
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,439
who's a cognitive neuroscientist at University College London.

28
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:47,679
Babies, even before they speak, have to tune into the languages around them to make sense out of what

29
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:48,719
people say to them.

30
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,599
And then when children start to speak several languages,

31
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,000
they have to focus on one language and ignore another one where they're speaking.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,359
They also have to be able to switch from one language to the other,

33
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,439
depending on who they're speaking to.

34
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,959
Later on in age, when adults have dementia,

35
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,280
they seem to show symptoms later when they're bilinguals as opposed to monolinguals.

36
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,719
Within that juggling, several languages has helped them really boost this brain efficiency,

37
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,560
which is a great advantage.

38
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,919
It's like a brain workout.

39
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:24,560
Frederick explains that babies who grow up learning more than one language have to tune into the

40
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,599
languages around them.

41
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,479
They have to listen to each language.

42
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:34,159
Over time, they become good at switching languages and ignoring the ones they don't need in a conversation.

43
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:38,879
Scientists think that juggling several languages is good for you.

44
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:43,599
If you juggle several things, that means you deal with all of them at the same time.

45
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,560
Frederick describes being a polyglot as a brain workout.

46
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,079
This means it's exercise for your brain that can make it stronger.

47
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,959
Now, Hannah, I don't know about you.

48
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,000
When I was younger and languages just seemed like another subject at school,

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,159
I didn't really care so much.

50
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,039
But when I worked abroad later in life, I was much more motivated and found it easier.

51
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:07,680
How about you?

52
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,400
Quite the opposite, actually.

53
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,800
I did find it easier to learn languages at school and university.

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,879
But I didn't have to learn these languages out of necessity.

55
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:25,200
But my colleague, Victoria Unmongkunda, she's a presenter and a journalist on the BBC World Service.

56
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,319
She did.

57
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,680
She speaks five languages and she understands eight.

58
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,400
And she learnt those languages because her family moved from Rwanda to Kenya and then to Norway

59
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,759
when she was a teenager.

60
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,359
Victoria says she was able to pick up Norwegian quite easily.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,039
If you pick up a skill, it means you learn it usually by being in the environment where that

62
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,359
thing happens rather than being taught.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,479
But Victoria's parents found it much harder to learn Norwegian.

64
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,199
Let's hear what Vic said on the What in the World podcast.

65
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,439
First of all, you're having them coming to a new culture completely from everything they've

66
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,400
ever known.

67
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,439
The language is new.

68
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,919
These are people in their 50s.

69
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,479
You know, but they they soldier on because if you want to work, if you want to live there,

70
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,079
you have to learn and they did.

71
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:18,720
It wasn't easy, but I think also with that kids, we picked it up quite quickly.

72
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,240
So if they were making a mistake, who were also helping them along the way.

73
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,079
So it kind of a way of paying back, you helped us get to this, you know,

74
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,959
to keep our mother tongue in here, we are going to help you.

75
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,040
Victoria's parents found it difficult to learn Norwegian in their 50s,

76
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,480
but they soldiered on.

77
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,000
They continued doing something even though it was difficult.

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,040
And I love that the family helped each other with their languages, Hannah.

79
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,439
Yes, so Vic's parents helped them keep their mother tongue in your

80
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,000
under when they had to leave Rwanda.

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,680
And then years later, the children helped their parents learn Norwegian.

82
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,080
And Hannah, Victoria picked up Norwegian quite easily, even after learning four other languages.

83
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,520
Did Victoria have any tips for learning so many languages?

84
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,639
Well, one thing she recommended is trying to immerse yourself in the language.

85
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,319
So she said go to the market or into the street,

86
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,599
a place where you can listen to people using the language.

87
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,719
Yes, and some learners might be learning English online,

88
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:21,759
and so they don't have the opportunity to go to a market or street and hear the language.

89
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,759
But there are other things that you can do.

90
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,240
For example, you can listen to six minute English,

91
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,240
or you could try other BBC podcasts like What in the World, too.

92
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,199
What in the world is the programme that I work on,

93
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,240
and we put out a new episode every weekday.

94
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,800
We look at stories from around the world covering news and trending topics

95
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,360
to try to help you make sense of the world.

96
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,480
Time now for the answer to our quiz question.

97
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,560
I asked you which country has the most officially recognised languages?

98
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,079
I said Zimbabwe.

99
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,560
And I'm afraid that was the wrong answer.

100
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,199
It was in fact Bolivia, which recognises 37 languages,

101
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,759
though of course not everyone speaks all of them.

102
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,199
Now let's recap the vocabulary that we have learnt.

103
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,680
Starting with Polyglot, which is someone who knows lots of languages like me.

104
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,839
If you tune in to something, you listen or pay attention to it.

105
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:19,839
Juggling several things like languages means doing several different things at the same time.

106
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,039
A brain workout is exercise for your brain.

107
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,039
If you pick up a skill, you learn it, usually through practice rather than being taught.

108
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,600
And if you soldier on, you continue doing something even though it's difficult.

109
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,400
Thanks for listening to 6 Minute English,

110
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,360

113
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,280
Goodbye.

114
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:47,920
Ciao.

115
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,720
Adios.

116
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,680
Atilago.

117
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,720
Sayonara.

118
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,520
Bye.
