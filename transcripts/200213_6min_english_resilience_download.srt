Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Rob.

6
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:19,120
And I'm Georgina.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,640
Now Georgina, how resilient are you?

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
Resilient? You mean able to cope with difficult situations?

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,479
I have a pile of work to do today, but I'm remaining calm and not getting stressed.

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,200
Well that's good. You are showing resilience.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,600
And today we're discussing whether we're born with resilience or we have to learn it.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,359
Okay Rob. But first I expect you're going to ask me a question.

13
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:44,239
Bring it on.

14
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:51,519
Okay. Resilience is also a word used in science to describe the characteristic of a substance or object.

15
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,359
But what does it mean?

16
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:59,679
A that it's very tough or hard, B that it can return to its original shape after being bent,

17
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,280
or C it can turn from a solid into a liquid quickly.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,840
I have a feeling it means B, an object that returns to its original shape after being bent.

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,319
Okay. I'll let you know if you were correct at the end of the programme.

20
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:16,719
But let's talk more about human resilience.

21
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:23,280
There are many self-help books and motivational speakers all promising us we can learn to be resilient.

22
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,640
Well it is a useful trait to have and it's something that can help you deal with many difficult

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,159
situations from coping with the pressures of work to handling the death of a loved one.

24
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,840
And it's more than just telling someone to toughen up or get a grip as Dr David Wesley knows.

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,319
He is head of psychology at Middlesex University and talked about levels of resilience on the BBC World

26
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,239
Service programme, the Y Factor.

27
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:55,679
First of all there's our social supports, our communities, our families, the people are important

28
00:01:55,679 --> 00:02:00,879
to us, the organisations we work for. So one way we can look at resilience is to measure that.

29
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,359
The amount of social support available to us.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,799
Another way to think about resilience is to think about how we think about the situations we're in.

31
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,319
So for example, one way to look at that would be just to look at how optimistic people are

32
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,599
as a guide to how resilient they might be when times get tough.

33
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,400
And then a third level that we can look at for resilience is a biological level.

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,319
How well we can sue ourselves, calm ourselves down, how well we can actually regulate our

35
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,680
own nervous systems at times of distress.

36
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:39,039
Right so Dr Wesley describes social supports. The people around us who we can talk to and support

37
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:45,439
us and generally make us feel better. I think he's saying with more support we'll feel more

38
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:51,120
resilient. It's interesting to note that a resilient person isn't necessarily someone quiet

39
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,840
who doesn't make a fuss and gets on with things. Some experts think it's people who ask for help

40
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,479
and use this social support network who are acting in a more resilient way.

41
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,599
It's a good point and another level of resilience is how optimistic someone is.

42
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,960
Being optimistic means having positive thoughts about the future and believing things will

43
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:17,280
turn out well. A positive mind means you can deal with situations that at first look tough.

44
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:24,079
Another level Dr Wesley mentioned was our biological level. How are bodies cope in times of distress.

45
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,639
Distress is the feeling you get when you are worried or upset by something.

46
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:34,879
So when we're distressed a resilient person is able to soothe his or her body and regulate his or

47
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:41,280
her nervous system which helps them stay calm. But Rob the big question is are we born with resilience

48
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,079
or can we learn it? Experts speaking on the Y Factor program tended to think it could be learned.

49
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:53,759
Yes one of them is Anne Maston a professor at the University of Minnesota. From her studies she

50
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:59,039
found it was something that we learn when we need to. Anne Maston talks about how some of the

51
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:05,519
children she studied manifest resilience from the start. When something manifests it shows clearly

52
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,599
and is easy to notice. They remain resilient despite adversity at difficult time in their life

53
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:18,000
that they have had to face. Other children what she calls the late bloomers started off less resilient,

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,079
struggled with adversity but turned their lives around by becoming more resilient. Maybe we can learn

55
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,120
resilience from having a bad experience. Well one thing Anne went on to say was that families

56
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,879
and friends can be a great support and help with resilience. Those that were late bloomers only

57
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:41,039
connected with adults and mentors later in life. Yes she says that teachers or parents are role models

58
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:46,560
in how to handle adversity and children are watching they're learning from the adults around them

59
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,959
by seeing how they react when they get challenged by something. Time now to find out how resilient you

60
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,239
are when you discover the correct answer to the question I asked earlier. I said that resilience

61
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:04,639
is also a word used in science to describe the characteristic of a substance or object but what does

62
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,679
that mean? Is it A it's very tough or hard B it can return to its original shape after being bent

63
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:18,479
or C it can turn from a solid into a liquid quickly and what did you say Georgina? I said it was B

64
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,879
can return to its original shape after being bent. And you are right well done. Bamboo is a good

65
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:30,640
example of a resilient material you can bend it it doesn't break and returns to its original shape.

66
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,360
Thanks to the Science lesson Rob now we need to recap the vocabulary we've mentioned today.

67
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,040
Yes we've talked about being resilient an adjective that describes someone's ability to cope

68
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:47,280
with difficult situations. When you do this you show resilience. Someone who is optimistic has

69
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:52,719
positive thoughts about the future and believes things will turn out well. Distress is the feeling

70
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:57,759
you get when you are worried or upset by something. When something manifests itself it shows clearly

71
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:04,239
and is easy to notice and adversity is a difficult time in somebody's life that they've had to face.

72
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:09,359
And that brings us to the end of this discussion about resilience. Please join us again next time.

73
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:10,879
Bye bye.
