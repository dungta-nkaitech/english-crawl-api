00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,919
Hello, this is 6-Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:13,120
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,039
Would you like some fried chicken and chips with gravy, Beth?

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,280
No, thanks, Neil. I don't really like fried chicken. It's too oily for me.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,920
Okay, no problem. But maybe you'd like some organic poulÃ© roti

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,160
in a tender meat jou with fried.

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,399
Oh, that sounds interesting. What is it?

9
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,000
Well, it's French for chicken and chips with gravy.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,399
It's a strange fact, but the same dish described using different words can make it sound

11
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,159
more delicious, more exotic and more desirable.

12
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:49,200
Restaurants think carefully about the language they use to describe the food on their menus,

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,480
trying to make it sound appealing, tasty or poetic. Instead of hamburgers, we have gourmet burgers.

14
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:02,640
It's jou, not gravy. And raspberry coulis sounds a lot tastier than raspberry sauce.

15
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:08,719
Many of the words used to describe gourmet food. That's food which is higher quality

16
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:14,799
and more sophisticated than usual are French. Coming from a country with a long tradition of high

17
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,039
level cooking called oat cuisine. But how does the language use to describe food affect our

18
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,880
psychology and help restaurants make menus which are both tempting and profitable?

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,480
That's what we'll be finding out in this programme along with some useful new vocabulary as well.

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,520
But first, I have a question for you, Neil. To train as a classical French chef takes months

21
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,000
as a full-time apprentice. But what is the name of the most famous cooking school teaching French

22
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:54,719
cuisine? Is it a, le cod om ble, b, le cod om rouge, or c, le cod om noir?

23
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,159
Well, I think it's le cod om ble. Okay, Neil. I'll reveal the correct answer later.

24
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:07,120
It's important for restaurants to describe items on the menu so diners know what to expect.

25
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:13,920
And many chefs think foreign words sound more exciting. But according to linguist Dr.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,280
Kerry Matwick, the use of French is decreasing. Here, Kerry explains why to Ruth Alexander,

27
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,119
presenter of BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain.

28
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:29,039
Yeah, there are studies that show that because it sounds fancier. You know,

29
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:35,199
the French food has long been considered the gourmet food. And it was popular, but I would say

30
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:41,439
now there's a tendency to not use French because it sounds pretentious. So it can turn a dine or off.

31
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:47,599
Many restaurants use French names in menus because they sound fancy, an adjective meaning

32
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:54,560
special or unusual with lots of decoration. Kerry disagrees. She thinks French names used to be

33
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,280
popular, but are now seen as pretentious. If something is pretentious, it tries to appear more

34
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,479
important or clever than it really is. Some diners like the French names, but it turns other diners

35
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:13,840
off. If something turns you off, it makes you stop feeling interested or excited.

36
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,079
Brazilian chef Caroline Martins agrees that using French names in menus is becoming a thing of

37
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:26,479
the past. Caroline has stopped using French names in her pop-up restaurant, Samper, in Manchester,

38
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:31,439
as she explains to Ruth Alexander for BBC World Service programme The Food Chain.

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,679
I am classically trained in a French cuisine. I was using a lot of French terms, you know.

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,120
That wasn't very welcome. People would be very confused. They would ask me,

41
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,439
what is this Bruno Mars? What is this chiffonade? They would definitely avoid the dishes or they

42
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:55,760
would be sarcastic as well about it. I had people looking at the bus sitting down and then they

43
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,840
start seeing all these French terms and they just leave. Really? Yes. I had that happening.

44
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,159
You had people walking out to the restaurant. I just think this isn't for me. This is for me.

45
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,079
This is for me. What is this? What am I eating? I want to eat food. I don't want to eat

46
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:18,480
food. Not names, posh names. Instead of feeling excited about dishes described in French,

47
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,839
Caroline's diners were sarcastic about them. They mocked and made fun of them.

48
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:29,120
Some diners even walked out. Caroline thinks French makes her cooking sound too

49
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:36,800
posh, too fashionable, expensive and not available to everyone. She's now started using English and her

50
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,399
native Brazilian Portuguese on the menu and is pleased with the results. Customers don't feel

51
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:47,840
confused and their curiosity about the Brazilian dishes starts a conversation with the waiter.

52
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,399
All this talk of food is making me hungry, Neil. Anyway, it's time to reveal the answer to my

53
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,919
question. What's the name of the famous French cooking school that teaches Oat Quazine?

54
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,919
I said it was Le Corse en Blu. Was I right? Le Corse en Blu was the correct answer.

55
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,639
The famous culinary art school, Le Corse en Blu, first opened its doors in Paris in 1895.

56
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:19,439
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt from this programme starting with gourmet food,

57
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,519
which is better quality and more sophisticated than usual and is often more expensive.

58
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:32,480
The adjective fancy means special, unusual and decorative. If someone is pretentious,

59
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,639
they try to appear more important or clever than they really are.

60
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,800
The phrase to turn someone off means to make someone stop feeling interested or excited.

61
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,959
If you say something sarcastic, you mock and insult something by saying the opposite of what you

62
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:55,199
mean. And finally, the adjective posh means fashionable, smart, expensive and exclusive.
