2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,720
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Phil.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,320
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,080
Most people have eaten some unusual food at least once in their life.

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,920
What's the most unusual thing you've ever eaten Beth?

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,920
Oh, I ate camel in Australia and I really didn't like it, to be honest.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,920
What about you?

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,240
I ate Cayman in Northern Argentina and it was delicious.

9
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,280
Oh, okay, good.

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,800
Well, in this programme we'll be discussing some very unusual food known as Forever Food.

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:48,600
Dishes like stews and soups, which can be kept going day after day, year after year.

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,120
We'll also be learning some useful new vocabulary, all of which you can download,

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,880
along with a worksheet for this programme at our website, BBCLearningEnglish.com.

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,640
But let's get back to Forever Food and a Bangkok restaurant called Watanupanik,

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,799
that's famous for a soup, which has been cooking for over 50 years.

16
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:14,920
Here's Radio listener David Shirley, who called BBC World Service programme

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,240
the food chain after tasting the soup himself.

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,320
I had never heard of a perpetual stew before,

19
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,920
but the first time I'd ever heard about it was when I was in Bangkok.

20
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,120
I found a stew that had been simmering for 50 years.

21
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:37,640
David tasted perpetual stew, a pot into which ingredients are placed and cooked continuously.

22
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:44,799
The pot is never completely emptied, instead new ingredients and water are added when necessary and left simmering.

23
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,560
Cooking at a temperature just below boiling so that the food bubbles gently.

24
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,439
A 50-year-old soup might not be to everyone's taste,

25
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,799
but Forever Foods are surprisingly common.

26
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:02,519
And Phil, I have a question for you about Watanupanik's 50-year-old soup.

27
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:05,319
What do you think is the main ingredient?

28
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:11,479
Is it A, beef, B, chicken, or C, vegetables?

29
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:15,359
Ooh, I think vegetables, I think that's probably safer.

30
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:19,599
OK, well, we'll find out the correct answer later in the programme.

31
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,360
It's not just Bangkok where people cook for Forever Foods.

32
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,320
Fuchsia Dunlop is a writer and cook specialising in Chinese food.

33
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,560
Here, she tells BBC World Service programme The Food Chain

34
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,160
about a Chinese stew that is rumoured to be 100 years old.

35
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,160
In China, they sometimes, you know, professionals talk about having a banyan lao l'ou,

36
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,640
which means like a hundred-year-old broth.

37
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,480
So I don't know if this is strictly true, but theoretically,

38
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,000
as long as you have a good practice of hygiene,

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,360
which is to say that you always skim it and boil it every day

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,240
and also replenish it as needed with more water, more salt, more spices,

41
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,000
and you keep tasting.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,879
Then it just gets richer and richer.

43
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,560
Cooks need to replenish a Forever Stew.

44
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,719
To fill it up again with fresh ingredients before it's completely eaten,

45
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:16,719
by being regularly replenished, some dishes are rumoured to last 100 years.

46
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:19,240
Wow, that is a long time.

47
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,680
Fuchsia doesn't know if it's strictly true or completely true

48
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,360
that the same stew has really lasted 100 years,

49
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,879
but she thinks it's possible in theory,

50
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,480
as long as it's kept safe and hygienic through boiling.

51
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,360
Professor Martha Carlin is a historian with a special interest in medieval cookery.

52
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,360
Here, she explains to BBC World Service programme The Food Chain

53
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,160
why long-lasting foods could have been familiar to people in the Middle Ages.

54
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,479
In theory, it would make sense to think that people who didn't have matches

55
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:57,079
or fire starters, for whom starting a fire from scratch was quite a cumbersome process,

56
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:02,159
would naturally want to keep a stew pot bubbling if they had the means to do that

57
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,400
and to avoid the labour of constantly restarting the fire,

58
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,879
and also to make sure that they had a hot meal waiting at any time.

59
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,519
Having hot food bubbling away on the fire means there is always something

60
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,959
ready to eat and avoids having to start a fire from scratch.

61
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,240
When you do something like cook food or make a fire from scratch,

62
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,599
you do it from the beginning without the help of anything that has already been made.

63
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:33,560
Starting a fire is also cumbersome,

64
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,039
an adjective meaning difficult to do, taking time and effort,

65
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:42,839
but Professor Carlin says only rich families were able to afford enough wood

66
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,839
to keep a fire going all day.

67
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:47,479
Anyway, all this talk of food has made me hungry, Beth.

68
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:50,199
So, what was the answer to your question?

69
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:56,359
Ah, I asked you what the main ingredient is in the Bangkok stew,

70
00:04:56,359 --> 00:05:02,039
and you said vegetables, and I'm afraid that's wrong, it was in fact beef.

71
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:07,239
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt in this programme about forever foods,

72
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:09,199
such as perpetual stew.

73
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,359
A pot of stew into which new ingredients are regularly added,

74
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,720
allowing the dish to be eaten over a long time.

75
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,280
When food is simmering, it's cooking at a temperature slightly below boiling

76
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,439
so that it bubbles gently.

77
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,280
The verb replenish means to fill something up again.

78
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,960
If something is not strictly true, it's not completely or entirely true.

79
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,400
When you do an activity such as cooking from scratch,

80
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,879
you do it from the beginning without using anything that has already been made.

81
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,240
And finally, if an activity is cumbersome,

82
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,519
it's difficult to do and takes a lot of time and effort.

83
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,639
