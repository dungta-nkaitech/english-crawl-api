00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,480
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Georgie.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,800
And I'm Neil. In this programme, we're talking about the immune system,

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,240
which is the body's natural defence against getting ill.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,879
Now Georgie, is there anything you do to boost your immune system?

6
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,920
Yes, I try to eat lots of oranges, which apparently have lots of vitamin C.

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,880
And there are lots of things people do to try to improve their immune system and stay healthier,

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,800
like eating certain foods, taking vitamins, or even activities like swimming in cold water.

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,040
We'll find out how useful some of these techniques are in today's programme.

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,799
But first, Georgie, a question. We all know the common cold.

11
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,439
Now, that's the illness that makes you cough and sneeze, have a sore throat and headache.

12
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,560
But how many colds does the average adult get in the UK each year?

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,600
Is it A, 2-3, B, 4-5, or C, 7-28?

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,879
Hmm. Eight would be a lot. I'm going to go with A, 2-3 colds a year.

15
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,840
Well, we'll find out at the end of the programme if you're right.

16
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,640
Now, many people can become ill over the winter, with diseases like colds, flu, and Covid-19.

17
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,840
Host of BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Health, James Gallagher,

18
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,520
gathered some experts to talk about immune systems, and he started off by asking whether they'd

19
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:37,120
had more illnesses than usual this winter. Hello. Hi. Right. How has everyone been this winter?

20
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:43,439
Because I've had a rotten one, and I have felt constantly ill since about November, John.

21
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,200
I have not had anything yet to touch with. Okay, let's see what I can

22
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,640
factor with by the end of the show, Margaret. I was pretty unwell in September.

23
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,840
I had what I presumed to be Covid, but I've been alright since my old snuffles aside.

24
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,120
Eleanor, I really need someone to back me up. No, sorry, I've been absolutely 100% tickity-boo.

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,560
Unlike James, Professor John Tregoning hasn't been ill. John uses the expression

26
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,360
touch wood, which is an informal phrase said in order to avoid bad luck.

27
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,520
Dr Margaret McCartney was unwell in September, but has only had a few snuffles since.

28
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,880
Snuffles is an informal word used to describe minor illnesses that affect your nose.

29
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,840
We can also say sniffles. Host James is surprised that nobody has been ill,

30
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,120
and says to Professor Eleanor Riley, back me up. If you ask someone to back you up,

31
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,640
you're asking for them to say something which supports your opinion.

32
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:42,959
But Eleanor has had a healthy winter too. She's been tickity-boo, which is an informal phrase,

33
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,239
meaning everything's fine or in good order. Throughout the winter, many people try different

34
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,599
techniques, like taking supplements or eating certain foods to boost their immune system,

35
00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:00,079
to improve their body's natural defenses against disease. Host of BBC Radio 4's Inside Health,

36
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:05,199
James Gallagher asks Dr Margaret McCartney whether some of these products are successful.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,719
Okay, quick fire round, Margaret, Echinacea. No. Turmeric. No. Ginger shots. No. This is a very,

38
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,759
very good quiz. What about the stuff you squirt when you're at the beginning of an infection?

39
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:24,239
Interesting, but not any better than normal ceiline spray, just saltwater.

40
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,759
In fact, according to Margaret, there isn't enough evidence that many popular health products

41
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:35,039
can actually change the way your immune system works. Another popular health trend in the UK

42
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:40,879
is cold water swimming. People who swim in cold water say it's good for their mental health,

43
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,199
and they also believe it makes them less likely to get ill during the winter months.

44
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:51,039
But scientists aren't sure about the benefits of cold water swimming for the immune system yet,

45
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,840
as Professor John Tragoning explains to BBC Radio 4's Inside Health.

46
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,519
The social element actually is really important. It probably is beneficial to do. You reduce stress

47
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,320
and cortisol dampens the immune system. So actually if you're stressed, then maybe you are more

48
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,360
prone to infection and that may be why that benefit of being with people, nice people that you

49
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,319
like in nice places is helping. But I don't think it's unique to cold water swimming. I think you

50
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,600
could probably get it from dancing or singing or going for a run. John says that cortisol,

51
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,879
a chemical associated with stress, dampens the immune system. Here dampens means makes weaker.

52
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:34,000
We also have a common expression dampens someone's spirits, which means to make them less

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,759
enthusiastic about something. John says that there is evidence that people who are stressed are more

54
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,040
prone to infection. If you're more prone to something, it's more likely to happen to you.

55
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,319
It could be that cold water swimming reduces stress, and so it helps people's immune systems work

56
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,879
well. But there are lots of other activities that could have the same effect and help people

57
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:00,319
have fewer colds over winter. Which reminds me of my question, Georgie? I asked how many colds

58
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:07,920
the average UK adult has a year? And I said two to three. And that is the correct answer, so well done.

59
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,680
Thank you. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned starting with touch wood, which is an

60
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,879
expression used often in speech to avoid bad luck. Snuffles or sniffles are minor illnesses that

61
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,399
affect your nose. If you ask someone to back you up, you want them to say something to support

62
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,079
your opinion. The expression tickety-boo means fine and in good order. If you dampen something,

63
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,719
you make it weaker. And the expression dampens someone's spirits means you make them less

64
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:42,399
enthusiastic about something. And if you're more prone to something, it's more likely to happen to you.
