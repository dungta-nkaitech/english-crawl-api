Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Rob.

4
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:18,879
And I'm Georgina.

5
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:23,920
What do Vincent Van Gogh and Galileo Galilee have in common, Georgina?

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,320
Hmm. Their first name and last names both start with the same letter.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,000
Well, that's true. But another similarity is that their amazing contributions to art and

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,359
science were only recognised after their death.

9
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:42,719
I know another person who's huge contribution to science went unrecognised during her lifetime

10
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,120
rope. But unlike Van Gogh or Galileo, you probably haven't heard of her. She's a subject of this

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,880
programme. Henrietta Lacks was a young black American mother who died of cancer in Baltimore

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,480
in 1951. Although she never consented to her tissues being used for medical research,

13
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,400
doctors at the time found her cells to have an extraordinary ability to replace themselves

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,359
endlessly.

15
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:14,000
Named healer cells after her initials, Henrietta Lacks' tissue helped make possible all sorts of

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,800
medical breakthroughs from the polio vaccine to cancer drugs to HIV and IVF treatments.

17
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,560
Born 100 years ago, in 1920, the great great-granddaughter of slaves,

18
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,599
Henrietta and her cells continue to provide medical discoveries to this day.

19
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,759
Most recently, of course, in the race for a coronavirus vaccine.

20
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,759
But before we go on Georgina, it's time for my quiz question.

21
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:46,560
I mentioned that Henrietta Lacks was born 100 years ago. But do you know what other medical breakthrough

22
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,079
happened in 1921? Was it A, the discovery of insulin, B, the discovery of penicillin,

23
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,200
or C, the discovery of vitamin E?

24
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,320
I'll say A, the discovery of insulin.

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,599
Okay Georgina, we'll find out if that's right later on.

26
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,240
Now, it was Henrietta's biography by science writer Rebecca Sglute that brought her remarkable

27
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,039
story to the world's attention a decade ago.

28
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:19,519
Here is Rebecca Sglute explaining Henrietta's importance to BBC World Service Program, the forum.

29
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:26,079
So much of science is based on growing cells and culture, which started with her cells

30
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:32,159
in vitro fertilization. That started with the ability to grow embryos and culture, which you can

31
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,599
do in part thanks to her cells. So the list just goes on and on. And right now, people are often asking

32
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,239
how are he, how are he, the cells helping with COVID? Scientists work that out very quickly using

33
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,120
her cells. They figured out what the receptor looks like. And they did the same thing with HIV.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,439
So her cells are just this incredible workhorse that is at the base of so much science.

35
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,680
Doctors used Henrietta's cells to figure out or understand how cells reproduce and divide.

36
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,560
Knowledge that was vital in developing in vitro fertilization or IVF, a technique for women

37
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,599
who cannot become pregnant naturally, in which an egg is fertilized outside the body.

38
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,479
Our bodies are made of millions and millions of cells. And to understand how they work,

39
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:24,719
we need to grow them in a lab. No one had succeeded in doing this until Henrietta's extraordinary

40
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:31,360
cells which just grew and grew. This resulted not only in fertility treatments, but later in AIDS

41
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,360
and cancer breakthroughs, which is why Rebecca refers to healer cells as a workhorse, meaning

42
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,200
someone who does a lot of work. But perhaps Henrietta's greatest legacy of all was the vaccine

43
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,680
for polio. Here's Professor of Genetics, Sir John Byrne, talking to BBC World Services,

44
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,600
the forum. Henrietta would have particularly liked the announcement this year that polio vaccine

45
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:02,320
had led to the eradication of polio in Africa. So the centenary of her birth, it seems rather symbolic

46
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:09,039
that her unwitting contribution to medicine eventually eradicated that scourge of mankind.

47
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,359
John Byrne calls polio as scourge, meaning something causing much pain and suffering.

48
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:21,199
Henrietta's role in eradicating this terrible disease is all the more remarkable as she was never

49
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,360
asked permission to use her cells for research. And it's taken decades for the Laks family to win

50
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:33,360
their grandmother the recognition she deserves. That's why John Byrne calls Henrietta's contribution

51
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,360
unwitting. It was made without her knowledge or consent. And with the eyes of the world now focused

52
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,000
on vaccines for the coronavirus, this year is a symbolic time to celebrate her centenary, the 100th

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,920
anniversary of an important event. Henrietta Laks, a remarkable woman whose name is finally making

54
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,160
its way into the history books. But something else remarkable happened 100 years ago, didn't it Rob?

55
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,400
Ah yes, you mean my quiz question. I asked you which important medical breakthrough occurred 100

56
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:12,319
years ago in 1921. I said A, the discovery of insulin. Which was the correct answer? Discovered by

57
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:19,040
Canadian doctor Frederick Banting, insulin saved the lives of millions of diabetics. And on that healthy

58
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:26,960
note, let's recap the vocabulary from this program starting with in vitro fertilization or IVF

59
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,560
a medical technique for women who cannot become pregnant naturally. Henrietta's healer cells help

60
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,759
doctors figure out or understand a lot about how cells grow and led to so many medical discoveries

61
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,840
we might call them a workhorse. Something which works extremely hard. A scourge means something

62
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:51,519
that causes much pain and suffering, like the terrible diseases which Henrietta's unwitting

63
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:58,399
or unknowing contribution helped eradicate. Making 2021 a year of hope and the perfect time to

64
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,479
celebrate the centenary of her birth, its 100th anniversary. We hope this upbeat program has

65
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,879
been just what the doctor ordered. Remember to join us again soon at 6 Minute English. Bye for now.

66
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:16,480
Goodbye!
