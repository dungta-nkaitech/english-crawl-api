Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,839
And I'm Sam.

5
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:27,039
English has many proverbs, short and well-known phrases giving a piece of useful advice or common sense.

6
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,359
For example, the proverb actions speak louder than words.

7
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,519
Means that what people do is more important than what they say.

8
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:39,600
And the proverb don't judge a book by its cover.

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,200
It advises people not to form opinions about people based on how they look.

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,079
Proverbs are found in many cultures and languages and are often passed down through the

11
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,359
generations to teach children lessons in life.

12
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,240
One famous English proverb is an apple a day keeps the doctor away.

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,840
In other words, eating fresh fruit is good for you.

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,840
But is it really true?

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,319
Can eating an apple a day actually have significant health benefits?

16
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,840
That's the question we'll be discussing in this programme.

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,680
And as usual, we'll be learning some new vocabulary as well.

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,239
But before that, I have a question for you, Sam.

19
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:25,439
Most proverbs come from a place's history and England has a long history of growing apples.

20
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,959
Over the centuries, hundreds of different apple varieties have been grown in orchards up and down

21
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,319
the country, some with quite unusual names.

22
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,519
So which of the following is the name of a real type of English apple?

23
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:46,319
Is it a, a tailor's gold, be a golden pipin or see a black wister?

24
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,759
I don't know, but I think it's be a golden pipin.

25
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,879
Okay, Sam, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

26
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:59,280
But whatever the name of the apple, new scientific research is showing that there really are

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,280
health benefits to eating apples, especially with the skins on.

28
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:11,120
Apple skins are full of good stuff, fiber, vitamins and especially flavonoids,

29
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,079
a chemical compound known to reduce blood pressure and improve brain and heart health.

30
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:22,639
No wonder then that when Dr. Michael Mosley, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme,

31
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,280
just one thing, wanted a snack to eat he reached for an apple.

32
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:34,879
It's early afternoon and I'm a bit peckish, so I'm about to grab a delicious snack that could

33
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,479
improve my blood flow, boost my brain and trim my waistline.

34
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:47,039
It's not some exotic superfood, in fact it's an apple.

35
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:53,439
Dr. Mosley wanted something to eat because he was peckish a little bit hungry.

36
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:58,719
He wanted something healthy but chose an apple instead of exotic superfoods like

37
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:04,719
blueberries or a banana smoothie. If you call something exotic, you mean it's unusual and

38
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:11,919
exciting often because it comes from an unfamiliar place. Instead he ate the least exotic fruit I

39
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:19,759
can imagine, the humble apple. But Dr. Mosley thinks apples do have health benefits and he lists them.

40
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:27,280
Apple's improved blood flow, boost the brain and trim the waistline, a phrase which means to keep

41
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,919
a healthy body weight with no extra fat. Yes, one reason apples are so good for us is that the

42
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:40,239
skin is packed with flavonoids which help people lose weight and have even been linked to a longer

43
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,599
life. But that's not all. It's the fact that there are so many different ways of cooking and

44
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:52,319
eating apples which makes them one of the nation's favourite foods. His Dr. Mosley again explaining

45
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,639
how he likes to eat his apples to just one thing on BBC Sounds.

46
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,639
What I love about apples is they are so versatile. I've been snacking on them,

47
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:08,799
grating them into my porridge and having them sliced with full fat yogurt as a dessert.

48
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,839
But baked apples are one of my favourite ways to consume them. It seems an apple a day really

49
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:19,519
does keep the doctor away and also keep your heart gut and even your waistline in good shape.

50
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:28,240
Dr. Mosley eats apples in porridge, sliced with yogurt and even baked in the oven. He describes

51
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,799
them as versatile, things which can be used for many different purposes or in many different ways.

52
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:42,479
What's more, cooking or baking apples doesn't damage those healthy flavonoids. So even the occasional

53
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:49,359
apple crumble with custard can be good for you. Apple crumble and custard. Hmm, I'm not so sure

54
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,360
that's a way to get in good shape. A phrase meaning healthy or in good condition. But Neil,

55
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,920
it seems the old proverb is true. According to the science and apple a day really does keep the

56
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,920
doctor away. Right, it's time to reveal the answer to your question. Yes, I asked you about the

57
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,000
strange sounding names given to some varieties of English apple. And I said that a golden

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
pippin was the name of a real apple. So was I right? Yes, you were. Golden pippin apples were

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,279
first grown in Arondoll near the south coast of England. Well, the other two, Black Wister and

60
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:31,519
Taylor's gold are actually types of English pear. Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned

61
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:37,360
from this programme starting with proverb, a short sentence or expression giving some well-known

62
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,279
traditional advice. If you're feeling peckish, you're slightly hungry. The adjective exotic

63
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:49,279
describes something which is unusual and exciting often because it comes from a faraway place.

64
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:55,759
The phrase trim the waistline means to keep your body weight healthy with no extra fat around your

65
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:02,399
waistline, the area of your body above the hips. Something which is versatile can be used for many

66
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:08,559
purposes or in many different ways. And finally, if someone is in good shape, they're in a good state

67
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,879
of health. Once again, our six minutes are up. Bye for now. Bye.
