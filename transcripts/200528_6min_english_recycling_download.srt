Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,080
And I'm Georgina.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,199
Sorry I was late today, Georgina. I'd forgotten to take the recycling bins out

5
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,800
before the rubbish collection this morning. I seem to have more and more plastic packaging each week.

6
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:34,240
Actually, that's the topic of our programme. With more and more household waste being either

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:41,280
incinerated, that's burned, or being buried underground, we'll be asking, is the recycling system

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,200
broken? China used to accept 55% of the world's plastic and paper scrap. Another word for unwanted

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,400
waste. Or in other words, rubbish. That included waste sent over from Britain. But in 2018,

10
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,199
it stopped taking any more. Other countries like Indonesia and Vietnam,

11
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,280
sokova, China's waste processing role, but they too are now sending much of the scrap back,

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,519
arguing it is contaminated and is harming their own environments.

13
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:17,039
This has created major problems for countries in the West, who traditionally relied on others

14
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:22,799
to process their recycling waste. And the problem isn't going away. In fact, we are creating more

15
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:29,759
household waste than ever. So here's my quiz question. On average, how many kilograms of household

16
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:39,359
waste were generated per person in the UK last year? Was it A, 280 kilograms, B, 480 kilograms,

17
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:47,359
or C, 680 kilograms? That sounds like a lot of waste. I'll say A, 280 kilograms.

18
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,359
Okay, we'll find out later if you were right. Although nowadays people are recycling more,

19
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:59,359
the use of plastic isn't decreasing at the same rate. The BBC World Services programme The

20
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:06,480
Inquiry spoke to Roland Gaia, a professor at the University of California about the current situation.

21
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:16,879
There's been a real rise in consciousness, which is fantastic. And I'm really glad that now it seems

22
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,799
the public at large is really interested in this issue and appalled and wants to do something about

23
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:29,840
it, wants to change it. But at the same time, I don't see yet any real action that would make

24
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,680
things better. Because while all of this is happening, the virgin plastic industry is actually

25
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:43,039
increasing its production capacity. Workers who process recycling are often exposed to dangerous

26
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,639
waste materials which can harm them. Professor Gaia says there's been a raise in consciousness

27
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:54,159
about this problem, meaning that people are being told about an unfair situation with the aim of

28
00:02:54,159 --> 00:03:00,879
asking them to help change it. Now, Professor Gaia is an American and he uses rays as a noun.

29
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:08,159
The main problem comes from virgin plastic, original unused plastic containers. These are made

30
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:15,039
directly from fossil fuels like crude oil or natural gas, major sources of carbon dioxide and

31
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:21,280
climate change. But consciousness raising of this issue is having an impact. The public at large,

32
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,159
meaning most people in the world, rather than just some of them, are concerned about the increase

33
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,680
in plastic waste and want to do something to help. However, it's not always easy to know what the

34
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,079
best way to help is. Another expert, Professor Monik Sun, believes that focusing only on recycling

35
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,640
may not be the best idea. She conducted psychological experiments to find out more about people's

36
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,800
attitudes to recycling. And surprisingly, found that if people know recycling is an option,

37
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,720
they tend to use more resources. They reduce any guilty feelings by telling themselves that the

38
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:04,880
material will be recycled anyway. We have this slogan of reduce, reuse and recycle, and the

39
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,400
priority should be exactly that. Reduced and reused is better than recycling. And the cost of

40
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,439
recycling is often not emphasised enough. People perceive recycling to be great, but there is

41
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,360
actually significant labour and material cost associated with recycling.

42
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:30,159
Professor Sun mentions reduce, reuse and recycle as a useful slogan. A short, easily remembered phrase

43
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,800
often used to promote an idea, in this case, that we should all do what we can to protect the environment.

44
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,480
But while protecting the planet is a common goal, recycling in itself may not be so important.

45
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:50,080
It's better to reduce and reuse than recycle. So these two objectives should be emphasised,

46
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,480
highlighted as being especially important. Do you remember my quiz question? I asked you how many

47
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:04,480
kilograms of waste the average British person generated last year. I reckon it was a 280 kilograms.

48
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,759
That would be bad enough, but the real answer is b, 480 kilograms. Multiply that by the UK

49
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,840
population of 66 million and you start to see the size of the problem. Today we've been talking

50
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,520
about the problems associated with recycling scrap, another word for rubbish. Western countries

51
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:29,120
used to send their rubbish to China for recycling, but this caused issues for the local environment.

52
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,879
Some groups raised consciousness about the problem. May people aware of the situation to encourage

53
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:40,799
them to help change it. The public at large, most people in the world, are now aware of the need to

54
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:48,399
reduce, reuse and recycle. The slogan or short memorable phrase used by environmentalists to spread

55
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:55,120
their message. A related problem is the increase of virgin plastic, original, unused plastic made

56
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,439
from fossil fuels. Recycling is unable to keep pace with virgin plastic production, so instead

57
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:07,599
reducing and reusing plastic should be emphasised, highlighted as being especially important.

58
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,560
And that's all from us. Bye for now. Bye.
