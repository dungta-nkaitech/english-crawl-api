Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,160
And I'm Georgina.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,160
How did you spend your free time during the weeks of lockdown, Georgina?

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,080
Repainting the living room or doing exercise classes in the kitchen.

6
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,399
Actually, Neil, I've been doing some online research into my family history.

7
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,280
I'm investigating my family tree. You know, a drawing showing all the relationships

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,679
between the different members of my family.

9
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:43,280
Oh, how interesting. And how appropriate, because trees are the subject of this programme.

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,879
Not family trees, but real living in the forest trees.

11
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:52,959
Well, Neil, this might surprise you, but according to some people, trees also have families.

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,799
There are mother trees who support and help feed child trees.

13
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,760
That's right. According to Suzanne Simard, one of the world's leading tree researchers,

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,560
trees should be seen as intelligent. They communicate with each other. They help each other.

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,200
And as you mentioned, Georgina, they can even tell their family members.

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,599
So a tree can have its own family tree. Amazing. Tell me more.

17
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,280
Okay, Georgina. But first, let me ask you my quiz question.

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,120
The largest trees in a wood or forest are called mother trees.

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,799
As they're the biggest, mother trees usually have the longest, most connected roots.

20
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,640
So my question is this, what is the world's largest currently living tree?

21
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:43,280
Is it a, a Bayo Bab tree, b, a giant redwood tree, or c, a sequoia tree?

22
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,079
Mmm. I've seen photos of redwood trees in California and they're huge.

23
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,719
So I'll say b, a giant redwood. Okay, Georgina. I'm sure you only chose that because it's

24
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,039
the easiest one to pronounce, but we'll find out the answer at the end of the program.

25
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,959
Now, let's get back to that tree researcher, Suzanne Simard.

26
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,719
Her big idea was the wood wide web, a way of describing the network of underground roots

27
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,680
linking trees to other trees of the same family.

28
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,319
Here's Suzanne explaining more about tree families to the BBC World Service program,

29
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,039
We found that the parent trees were fever those seedlings that were of their own kin versus

30
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,280
the strangers. That's extraordinary. And when you say they favor their own family members,

31
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,359
you mean they'll send more nutrients to their offspring than they would to, as it were,

32
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:37,759
a stranger tree. That's right. Mother trees send food and nutrients to their own seedlings,

33
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:43,120
young plants that have been grown from a seed. In this way, parent trees help their offspring.

34
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,640
Another word for their children or young. Mother trees can recognize and feed other trees of

35
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,000
their own kin, an old-fashioned word, meaning family. With the extra nutrients and carbon they

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,319
receive, the offspring can extend their own root network and suck up even more nutrients.

37
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,840
Which in turn increases their own growth, turning some of them into the giants we see growing in

38
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,360
California and other parts of the world. Amazing. With trees behaving in clever ways like this,

39
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,040
it's no wonder Suzanne thinks they have intelligence. And that's not all. Listen again as Suzanne

40
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,720
discusses the question of whether trees are alive with BBC World Services, the big idea.

41
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,480
See if you can hear her opinion. Alive in the sense of having agency in their destinies,

42
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,480
instead of being, you know, I think a lot of people think of trees as just sort of like these

43
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,360
sticks that grow out of their ground. They're kind of these inert things that don't have agency

44
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,800
in their destiny that they don't change behaviors and make decisions, but what we're finding

45
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,960
is that they do all that. And you know what? Step back and think. Trees have evolved over

46
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,320
a long, long, long time way longer than human beings and they've evolved in communities and

47
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:00,480
they have to grow and survive. I think Suzanne believes trees are alive and intelligent because she

48
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,960
says they have agency. A concept meaning having the ability to act and affect your environment.

49
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,480
Dying trees even seem to know the future. Before they die, they warn their offspring to start

50
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,000
making new root connections. Sharing that trees have some understanding of their destiny.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Everything that happens in someone's life and what will happen in the future.

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,759
So it seems that trees are much more intelligent than we thought Georgina.

53
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,840
It's certainly going to change how I feel about going for a walk in the woods,

54
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,120
surrounded by all those intelligent trees chatting to each other. I wonder if they have family

55
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,319
arguments. Well, I wouldn't argue with one of those really gigantic trees, such as,

56
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,360
well Georgina, you tell me. Ah, you mean your quiz question about the largest living tree.

57
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,680
Exactly. What did you say? I said the largest currently living tree was

58
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,439
B, a giant redwood. Was I correct, Neil? Well, you got the giant part, right Georgina,

59
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:04,319
but in fact the answer was C, a giant sequoia named General Sherman. He lives in California's

60
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:11,279
giant forest. He's a whopping 83 meters tall and measures a massive 33 meters around the trunk.

61
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:17,839
Wow, and I bet he has a huge family tree. Ha ha, right then Georgina, let's recap the vocabulary

62
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:23,600
we've used, discussing intelligent trees, starting with family tree, a diagram showing the

63
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,560
relationships between family members. Trees are intelligent enough to communicate with their

64
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,079
children or offspring. These young plants which have grown from seeds are also known

65
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:39,279
as seedlings. Another word we learned is kin, an old-fashioned way of saying family.

66
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:45,919
According to tree experts, Suzanne Simard, trees have agency, a term describing the ability to act

67
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,959
and influence your surroundings. And the fact that trees make all kinds of decisions about their

68
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,759
lives suggests they understand their destiny. Everything that happens to someone during their

69
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,240
life, including in the future. Thank you for joining our walk through the woods of English
