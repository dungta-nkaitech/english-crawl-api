00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,880
Hello, welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,080
And I'm Rob.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,160
Rob, it's good to see you keeping up with fashion

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,640
by wearing the high-vis jacket,

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,719
although I have to say it is a bit dazzling.

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,039
Neil, I'm no fashion victim.

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,640
This high-vis or high-visibility jacket is for safety.

11
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:30,719
I wear it when I'm cycling around London,

12
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:32,799
and I've just forgotten to take it off.

13
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,240
And a fashion victim, by the way, is someone who always wears

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,399
what's thought to be fashionable, even if it doesn't actually look good on them.

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,799
But wearing high-vis clothing has become the latest fashion statement

16
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,200
that's something you wear to attract attention

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,679
and people who know something about fashion.

18
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,079
Well, I can assure you I don't wear my bright jacket to look cool,

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,920
but in today's programme we'll be discussing why some people do.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,280
But first, Neil, have you got a question for us to think about?

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,760
OK, we know that fashion's come and go,

22
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,640
but in which decade were leg warmers worn as a popular fashion accessory?

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,079
Was it A, the 1970s, B, the 1980s, or C, the 1990s?

24
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,240
I do remember these, so I'll say B, the 1980s.

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,040
Well, we'll reveal the answer at the end of the programme.

26
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,640
Now, let's talk more about the oddest item of clothing

27
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,079
to hit the catwalk this year, the humble high-vis jacket.

28
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:33,200
Yes, they were designed to be worn for safety by people like cyclists and pedestrians

29
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,599
and by workers who need to be seen if, for example, they're working on the road

30
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,359
or directing traffic.

31
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,319
So it's strange to think that now people choose to wear them to be on trend.

32
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,079
That's following the latest fashion.

33
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,519
Hannah Marriott is the fashion editor of the Guardian newspaper.

34
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,719
She told the BBC Radio 4 programme, You and Yours,

35
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,959
why she thought people were turning to bright, luminous clothing.

36
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,000
What was the reason?

37
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:03,280
There's also just a trend at the moment for people wearing very bright things,

38
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,120
very eye-catching things.

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,120
It feels that with social media, you know,

40
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,719
if one's sort of scrolling down their Instagram screens at such speed

41
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,280
and anything that sort of catches the eye that seems,

42
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,439
yeah, like a bit of a talking point or something that's going to get a bit of attention,

43
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,079
those kind of trends are getting a bit more traction at the moment

44
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,840
than the sort of understated cashmere jumper kind of fashion.

45
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,760
So her reason is social media.

46
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,640
In our fast-paced lives, we're quickly scrolling through our social media feeds

47
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,800
and people want to stand out, attract our attention and be noticed.

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,640
And these attention seekers need to wear something eye-catching,

49
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,360
something that will catch your eye and be noticed.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,240
High-vis clothing certainly does that.

51
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,719
Hannah mentioned that wearing something different creates a talking point,

52
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,320
something that you or I may discuss at work or on social media,

53
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,600
even if it's to say that guy looks ridiculous.

54
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,200
And she also mentions that people are becoming interested in

55
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,600
and accepting these kinds of trends.

56
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,760
The word she used was traction.

57
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,600
Traction here means this fashion trend is starting to stick.

58
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,120
Of course, fashion comes at a price, while an ordinary high-vis vest used for workwear

59
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,640
is normally affordable.

60
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,800
When they're sold as a fashion item, they can go for much higher prices,

61
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,719
particularly if they have a designer label showing on the front.

62
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,200
This raises an important question.

63
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,120
We know that many people wearing high-vis jackets are doing important jobs,

64
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,240
so does this fashion devalue what they're doing?

65
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,360
Yes, it's something Hannah Marriott talked about.

66
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,560
Let's hear from her again.

67
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,840
What word does she use to describe a difficult issue?

68
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,360
Every time fashion borrows from workwear,

69
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,920
there are always some sort of thorny issues around it,

70
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,599
particularly when you're charging Â£2000 for something

71
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,759
that is actually very similar to a uniform that somebody might be wearing.

72
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,599
He doesn't actually make that much money.

73
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,879
You know, there's obviously some thorny class issues there.

74
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,920
So she used the word forney to describe the issue of things worn at work

75
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,759
becoming expensive fashion items.

76
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,280
Forney issues are subjects that are difficult to deal with.

77
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,479
Here she particularly mentioned the issue of class,

78
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,720
so different groups of people in society and different economic positions.

79
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,480
Some can afford clothing for fashion,

80
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,879
others can only afford clothing for work.

81
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:26,879
And the other issue is that if everyone starts wearing high-vis clothing,

82
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,079
then the people who need to stand out for their own safety

83
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,240
may not stand out as easily.

84
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,759
And we wouldn't want to miss you when you're out cycling on your bike, Rob.

85
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,040
But would be miss you if you were wearing a pair of leg warmers.

86
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,120
Earlier I asked in which decade were leg warmers worn

87
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,360
as a popular fashion accessory?

88
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,560
Was it A, the 1970s, B, the 1980s or C, the 1990s?

89
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,920
Yes, and I said B, the 1980s. It's got to be right.

90
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,600
Well, you know your fashion, Rob.

91
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,439
It was indeed the 1980s.

92
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:00,320
Leg warmers were originally worn by dancers

93
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,520
to keep their muscles from cramping after stretching.

94
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,600
But in the early 1980s, they became fashionable for teenage girls to wear.

95
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,080
Okay, let's move on and recap on some of the vocabulary we've mentioned today.

96
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,000
Starting with fashion victim.

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,200
That's someone who always wears what's thought to be fashionable,

98
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,439
even if it doesn't actually look good on them.

99
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,960
Like that pair of red jeans he used to wear a needle.

100
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,200
They, Rob, were on trend.

101
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,920
That means in keeping with the latest fashion.

102
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,800
Of course, wearing something red is very eye catching,

103
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,760
which means attracting attention and being noticed.

104
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,360
Next, we mentioned traction.

105
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,520
If something gains traction, it becomes accepted and popular.

106
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,360
And then we had understated.

107
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,639
In fashion, this describes something that does not attract attention

108
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,080
and is not that impressive.

109
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,319
And then we discuss the word thorny.

110
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,680
A tree or bush with thorns is difficult to touch and handle

111
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,720
and similarly, a thorny issue is a subject that's difficult to deal with and discuss.

112
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,080
Well, we've covered some thorny and less thorny issues today,

113
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,800
but we know that fashion's change and maybe high-vis fashion won't be here forever.

114
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,560
That's it for now, but please join us next time for 6 Minute English.

115
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,840
See you soon, goodbye.

116
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,319
Bye-bye.
