Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,480
And I'm Sam.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,719
Sam, have you ever heard the expression

6
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,359
a problem shared is a problem halved?

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,039
Yes, Neil, I have.

8
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,320
Doesn't it mean that people often feel better after talking about their problems with someone?

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,920
Right. In this programme, we'll be hearing the extraordinary story of how these ideas were taken up

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,119
by a team of community grandmothers in Zimbabwe.

11
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:46,960
Zimbabwe has over 14 million people, but fewer than 20 psychiatrists.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,200
After years of economic turmoil, unemployment and HIV,

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,519
mental health is a huge challenge.

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,359
And doctors estimate that one in four Zimbabweans suffers from depression or anxiety.

15
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,359
When it proved impossible to find free space to use in hospitals,

16
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,800
psychiatrists Dr Dixon Chibander came up with the idea of turning public park benches

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,480
into spaces for therapy.

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,000
He recruited grandmothers who have both free time and plenty of life experience

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,080
to talk with individuals struggling with mental health issues like depression,

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,920
anxiety and trauma.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The grandmothers are drawn from the local community and trained over several weeks

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,280
in a talking therapy called CBT.

23
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,120
But what does that abbreviation CBT stand for?

24
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,719
That's my quiz question.

25
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,519
Is it a, chatting based therapy?

26
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:43,200
B, conversation, brain therapy or C, cognitive behavioral therapy?

27
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,439
Well, I think I'll say C, cognitive behavioral therapy.

28
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,439
Okay, Sam, we'll find out later.

29
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,200
Now, although the recent history of Zimbabwe has left millions struggling with mental health issues,

30
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,799
at the start of his project, Dr Dixon Chibander was the only psychiatrist working in public health

31
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,319
in the whole country.

32
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:08,079
And as well as a lack of provision, many villages were suspicious of talking therapy,

33
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:12,079
preferring to rely on traditional faith healers instead.

34
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:17,280
Which is why when Kim Chakonezza of BBC World Services, the documentary podcast,

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,520
spoke to Dr Dixon Chibander, she started by asking him whether people were supportive of his idea.

36
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:30,240
Initially, there was a lot of skepticism, a lot of resistance, particularly from colleagues

37
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,240
who thought this was not evidence-based.

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,960
And it wasn't going to work.

39
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,680
The whole idea of training grandmothers, I mean, this has not been done anywhere else in the world.

40
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,520
So naturally, there was resistance.

41
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,000
Were you at all apprehensive?

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,360
I was, to be quite honest.

43
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,680
At first, Dr Dixon Chibander's ideas were met with skepticism,

44
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,920
an attitude of doubting whether something is useful or true.

45
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,440
Grammar benches were a totally new idea never seen before anywhere in the world,

46
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,600
and so his colleagues naturally felt some resistance, refusal to accept a change or new idea.

47
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:14,320
Which left Dr Dixon Chibander feeling a little apprehensive, worried that something bad

48
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,079
was going to happen to his project.

49
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:22,159
Fortunately, as it turned out, Dr Dixon Chibander's apprehensions were wrong.

50
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,879
Grammothers are highly respected in Zimbabwean society, and as they started listening,

51
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,759
people began opening up and telling their stories.

52
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,840
The grammar benches have empowered over 50,000 people to deal with their life problems,

53
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,479
and Dr Dixon Chibander even has plans to move his idea online,

54
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,840
giving the world access to a virtual friendship bench.

55
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,879
Here he is again explaining on the BBC World Services, the documentary podcast,

56
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,079
why he believes his ideas have been so successful.

57
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,159
It works because it's simple, it's cheap, and it's run by communities,

58
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,639
particularly grandmother's, who are in essence a resource in African communities.

59
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,560
You know, they are the custodians of local culture and wisdom.

60
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,000
That's why it works, and it, I guess, does away with Western concepts.

61
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,480
Which remove the stigma that is normally associated with mental illness.

62
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,360
Clients are willing to share their problems with the grandmother therapist

63
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,719
because they are respected as cultural custodians.

64
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:30,240
People with responsibility for taking care of something,

65
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,519
or trying to protect ideas or principles.

66
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,719
In this case, local customs and wisdom.

67
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:41,519
This helps do away with or remove the stigma attached to mental health.

68
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:46,399
Strong feelings of shame or disapproval, which most members of the community have towards

69
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,199
something, such as psychological illness.

70
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,639
For Zimbabwean suffering, domestic violence, and employment, and dealing with HIV,

71
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,719
having a grandmother to talk to really can change their perceptions about how problems can be managed.

72
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:06,879
So it seems true that a problem shared is a problem halved, which reminds me of our quiz questions, Am.

73
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:14,480
Yes, you asked me what the talking therapy abbreviated to CBT stands for, and I said

74
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,759
see cognitive behavior or therapy.

75
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:25,040
Which is absolutely right. CBT, a way of managing problems by changing ways of thinking and behaving.

76
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,719
So this week we've been hearing the inspiring story of Zimbabwean, Dr. Dixon Chabandas,

77
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:32,639
grandma bench therapy.

78
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,800
An idea which was initially met with skepticism, a doubtful attitude, and resistance,

79
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,680
refusal to change and accept new ideas.

80
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,959
Dr. Dixon Chabandas' feelings of apprehension worries that the project would fail.

81
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:52,639
Proof false when his team of grandmother therapists were treated as custodians or protectors

82
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:59,199
of wisdom and life experience, who really could help people suffering depression, poverty, and trauma.

83
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:06,079
The success of the project helped do away with or remove strong feelings of shame or disapproval

84
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,719
felt by many people regarding mental health, known as stigma.

85
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:15,919
To hear more inspiring, topical stories, rein us again soon here at 6 Minute English.

86
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:16,719
Bye for now.

87
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:17,360
Goodbye.
