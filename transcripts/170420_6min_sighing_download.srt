5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,040
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English,

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,280
the program where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,519
I'm Dan and today we're talking about...

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,920
Sying. I'm Catherine.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,240
Now, was that a real sigh or just one to demonstrate the meaning?

10
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,919
That one was just for educational purposes, of course, Dan.

11
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:36,479
We'll be looking at why we sigh and learn how sighing keeps us alive.

12
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,960
Yes, very interesting. And it's not just humans that sigh, is it Dan?

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,119
Indeed, most mammals sigh and that brings me to today's question.

14
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,039
How many times does a mouse sigh in an hour on average?

15
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,439
Is it a twice, b 10 times or c 40 times?

16
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,039
I'm going to say the poor little thing was sigh about 40 times an hour.

17
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,119
Okay, let's find out if you'll write later on in the program.

18
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:05,920
Now, what is a sigh exactly?

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,120
Let's hear from Dr. Lin Barker, a cognitive neuroscientist from Sheffield-Hallum University in the UK.

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,280
It's a typically cardio respiratory kind of resetting mechanism

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,280
and most mammals will engage in sying of some kind.

22
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,840
Because people who don't sigh will eventually die, but it is a survival mechanism.

23
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,599
So, sying keeps us alive.

24
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:34,400
Dr. Barker called it a survival mechanism.

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,200
To survive means to continue living, especially in difficult circumstances.

26
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,960
A mechanism here means a system of behaviour.

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:50,240
So, a survival mechanism is something the body does automatically in order to survive.

28
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,560
But, Dan, why is sying a survival mechanism?

29
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,039
It's because sying can reset the lungs.

30
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,560
To reset is to return something to its original settings.

31
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,199
We often use this verb when talking about technology.

32
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:05,359
You can reset a computer or a phone.

33
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,280
Okay, that's fine, but how does a sigh reset the lungs?

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,919
Well, scientists from UCLA, that's the University of California, Los Angeles,

35
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,759
found that a sigh is a special kind of very deep breath

36
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,039
that keeps the tiny sacks of air in our lungs,

37
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,359
called alveoli, working properly.

38
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:28,399
And without sying, these alveoli would collapse and we would die.

39
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:33,280
We need the alveoli to transfer oxygen from our lungs to our blood.

40
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,680
Thankfully, we don't have to think about this need to reset our lungs.

41
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,239
Sying is in fact a reflex.

42
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:40,719
Boo!

43
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:41,199
Ha!

44
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:42,799
Ha!

45
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:43,679
Ha!

46
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:47,759
There you jumped and that was a fabulous reflex, Dan.

47
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,479
It's something our bodies do without thinking.

48
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,359
Something you do unconsciously or automatically.

49
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,319
I meant, ah, like a man.

50
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,759
Thank you for that, Catherine.

51
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:58,479
You're welcome.

52
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,199
Do you sigh a lot?

53
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,959
Well, I sigh when I'm tired and I sigh when I'm relieved.

54
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,679
I breathe a sigh of relief.

55
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,000
To breathe a sigh of relief, that's a great expression.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,520
It means what you think it means to sigh when you feel good

57
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,760
that something bad has not happened.

58
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,840
But it's often used metaphorically.

59
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,159
It relates more to the feeling of relief than the act of sying.

60
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:24,960
That's right.

61
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,040
Now, I breathed a sigh of relief when I found my mobile phone the other day.

62
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,000
I thought I'd lost it.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,640
It was new.

64
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,960
I was so pleased when I found it.

65
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,240
What about you, Dan?

66
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,560
I tend to sigh to show frustration

67
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,319
and sometimes resignation.

68
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,240
No, frustration is what we feel when things aren't going well,

69
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,719
when things are annoying us and they don't work,

70
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,879
when things are frustrating.

71
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,840
And resignation is what we feel when we finally accept

72
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,439
that something bad has happened, that we can't change.

73
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,599
We feel resigned to something.

74
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,800
So, relief, resignation, frustration, resetting our lungs.

75
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,599
It sounds like we humans never stop sying.

76
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,239
Well, actually, we humans sigh on average 12 times an hour.

77
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,479
But what about mice?

78
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,680
Well, I said I reckon they sigh about 40 times an hour.

79
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,560
Well, in fact, it is 40 times an hour.

80
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,639
The hearts of mice beat faster,

81
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,680
so they need to regulate their lungs more than humans.

82
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,759
Let's review today's vocabulary.

83
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:28,879
We had the phrase survival mechanism,

84
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,920
something we do without thinking that keeps us alive.

85
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,759
We often use this phrase

86
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,800
and the related phrase defense mechanism

87
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,879
when talking about what people do to cope with difficulties in life.

88
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,800
Next, we had reset.

89
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,640
You can reset a computer or a machine to make it work again.

90
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,040
This usually means switching it off and on again.

91
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,520
And you can reset a password.

92
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,960
This is a little bit different.

93
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,480
It means to set or choose a new password.

94
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,480
We also had the word reflex.

95
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,040
This is a physical action or reaction

96
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,560
that you can't control.

97
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,760
For example, Catherine?

98
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,319
Yes, Dan.

99
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,080
There, you closed your eyes, another reflex.

100
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,720
And we had to breathe a sigh of relief,

101
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,960
which means to feel better after something bad doesn't happen.

102
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,360
I breathe a sigh of relief when my friend recovered from her illness.

103
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,840
But we sigh for other reasons too.

104
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,320
Two useful sying words were frustration and resignation.

105
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,160
Frustration is the state of being frustrated.

106
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,480
We can say something is frustrating.

107
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,920
It's frustrating when the boss doesn't listen to me.

108
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,800
But let's say you move beyond feeling frustrated

109
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,880
and start feeling resigned.

110
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,600
Yeah.

111
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,760
And that would be when I finally accept the boss will never listen to me.

112
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,920
And that's when I'll resign.

113
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,360
To resign also means to voluntarily leave a job.

114
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,600
Please, Catherine, tell me that's just another vocabulary example.

115
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,840
Of course it is, Dan. I love my job.

116
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,320
You.

117
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,000
I only have a sigh about what?

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,200
12 times an hour?

119
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,719
Which is perfectly average.

120
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:02,959
And that's it for today's six minute English.
