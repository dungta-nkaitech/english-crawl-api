From BBC Learning English

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,480
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,600
And I'm Rob.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,480
Rob.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,240
What generation are you?

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,039
Oh well, what are my choices?

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,640
You can't choose what generation you are, it depends on when you were born.

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,320
Oh, okay then, what are the different generations?

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,960
Well, there are baby boomers who were born in between the 1940s and the early 60s.

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,560
Then there was Generation X born between the mid 1960s and the early 1980s.

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,560
Then there's Generation Y, also known as Millennials.

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,320
Born mid 1980s to late 1990s and...

16
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,320
Okay, let me guess, Generation Z, born in the late 90s or early

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,320
90s. You're very smart.

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,240
So, which one are you?

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,600
That would give away my age, wouldn't it?

20
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,439
But, okay, I have to confess, I am Generation X.

21
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,480
And what about you, Neil?

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,159
Yes, me too, Generation X.

23
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,280
But today, we're going to focus on Generation Z, also known as Gen Z.

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,879
What marks Gen Z in particular is that they are the social media generation.

25
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,159
They have never known a time without social media.

26
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:22,960
Oh, poor them.

27
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:24,959
Well, that's one view.

28
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,559
Other opinions are available.

29
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,879
Before we look at Gen Z in more detail, a question though.

30
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,759
No one can quite agree on who first used the term social media.

31
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,719
But we do know from which decade it came.

32
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:44,159
Was it A, the 1980s, B, the 1990s, C, the naughties?

33
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,359
That is the first decade of the 21st century.

34
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,799
Rob, what's your answer?

35
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,799
Well, come on, it's quite a recent thing, so it's got to be C, the naughties.

36
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,679
Well, we'll find out the answer later in the programme.

37
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:01,120
Now we're going to hear from Hiral Patel, who is an analyst for Barclays.

38
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,640
She appeared on BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme,

39
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,039
and was asked whether there was much difference between Millennials and Generation Z.

40
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,919
Does she think they are the same or different?

41
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,919
Most people view Generation Z as many millennials.

42
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,039
And that's because there is an obsession with the word millennial.

43
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,840
Our research shows that Gen Z are different,

44
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,479
and that they have their own set of values and preferences,

45
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,039
which consumer brands need a cater for.

46
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,920
Our research found that Gen Z are techinate,

47
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,800
high-pre informed consumers, and extremely savvy.

48
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,319
This hyper-connected world that we live in today is a new norm for them.

49
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,680
So, Rob, does Hiral Patel think there's much difference between the two generations?

50
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,199
Yes, she does, but she comments that not everyone does.

51
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:51,360
Millennial is a term that is used so frequently that many people think it refers to all young people.

52
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,719
Gen Z, she says, are not mini-millennials.

53
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,000
They are quite different and have their own values and preferences.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,599
And this is important for consumer brands, for companies who want to sell to this generation.

55
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,680
They need to cater for that generation, which means they need to provide goods that Gen Z want.

56
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,199
And she describes Gen Z as being techinate, hyper-informed consumers.

57
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:17,360
It's a bit of a mouthful, but essentially,

58
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,680
it means they are extremely comfortable with modern technology and social media.

59
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,000
And as a result, have a lot of information about what's going on in the world.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,840
This makes them savvy.

61
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,080
And being savvy means being able to understand situations well

62
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,960
and make clever decisions because of this knowledge.

63
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,200
Now, I think I'm pretty savvy when it comes to modern connected technology and media,

64
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,680
but I didn't grow up with it. It's new.

65
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,960
For Gen Z, this level of technology is what is normal.

66
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,360
It's all around and always has been.

67
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,400
It's then norm as Hiral Patel put it.

68
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,280
Here she is again.

69
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,120
Most people view generation Z as many millennials.

70
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,319
And that's because there is an obsession with the word millennial.

71
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,200
Our research shows that Gen Z are different and that they have their own set of values and

72
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,319
preferences which consumer brands need to cater for.

73
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,200
Our research found that Gen Z are techinate,

74
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,080
hyper-informed consumers and extremely savvy.

75
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,599
This hyper-connected world that we live in today is a new norm for them.

76
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,879
Right, time to review this week's vocabulary,

77
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,319
but first let's have an answer to that quiz.

78
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,159
In what decade was the term social media first coined?

79
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:30,959
Was it A, the 1980s, B, the 1990s or C, the naughties?

80
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,000
What did you say, Rob?

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,159
Yeah, well I said C, the naughties.

82
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:34,959
You're wrong.

83
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:38,159
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the 1990s is the answer.

84
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,159
I'm sure most of you got that one correct.

85
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,480
Right now, the vocabulary.

86
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,519
Yes, this week we've been talking about generations.

87
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:50,399
This is a term used to describe people born in a particular period of time,

88
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,079
usually but not always a period of about 18 to 20 years.

89
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,359
And we were focusing on generation Z or Gen Z,

90
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:59,839
which includes those born in the early naughties,

91
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:05,599
which is the first decade of the 21st century from 2000 to 2009.

92
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:08,399
The next expression was 2k2 for.

93
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,120
This means to provide something that is needed or wanted for a particular group.

94
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,840
And if you're trying to sell something, you need to cater for your target market.

95
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,840
And if your market is Gen Z, you need to be aware that they are tech-inate,

96
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,280
hyper-informed.

97
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,040
They've grown up with connected technology and are very knowledgeable.

98
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,840
And this makes them extremely savvy.

99
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,639
This adjective means smart and intelligent.

100
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,040
In this context, it means they're able to make smart decisions about what to buy,

101
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,000
because they're connected to so many sources of information.

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And for Gen Z, this level of interaction and connectivity is the norm.

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,959
It's what is normal, what is usual for them.

104
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:51,920
So, where I struggle sometimes with modern life and technology, for Gen Z, it's easy.

105
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,319
Well, that may be true, but I'm savvy enough to know that it's time to end the program.
