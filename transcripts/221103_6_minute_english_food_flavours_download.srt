Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

4
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,480
And I'm Neil.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,240
In this program, we're finding out all about food flavours.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,280
Although everyone knows what food they like the taste of,

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,240
the science behind flavours is complex.

8
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:32,000
Flavour involves much more than tasting with the tongue.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,359
It's also influenced by how food looks, smells,

10
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:37,200
and even how it's described.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,920
In this program, we'll be meeting the flavourists,

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,159
scientists who combine different natural and artificial ingredients

13
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,519
to create the flavours we love to taste in our food.

14
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:50,879
And of course, we'll be learning some new vocabulary as well.

15
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,920
Sounds delicious, Neil, but first I have a question for you.

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,280
No one really knows why, but certain flavours seem to work well together.

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,200
Some scientists think classic combinations like lemon and lime,

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:10,079
or strawberries and cream are so popular because they're chemicals over lap in special ways.

19
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,079
Sometimes this creates new, interesting, and unusual flavours.

20
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,640
So what weirdly popular combination was invented by British chef,

21
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,079
Heston Blumenthal?

22
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,439
Was it a, dark chocolate and sea salt?

23
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,480
B, milk chocolate and chilli or C, white chocolate and caviar?

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,319
Well, I've tried sea salt and chocolate, I think it tastes great.

25
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,679
So I'll say A.

26
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:37,439
Okay, Neil, I'll reveal the correct answer at the end of the program.

27
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,719
Nowadays, the flavour industry is big business.

28
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,439
Flavourists work in high-tech laboratories,

29
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,439
and every new ice cream, crisp or two-paste flavour,

30
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,560
is the result of years of scientific research.

31
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,560
But it wasn't always like that.

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,760
Here's food historian Dr. Nadia Berenstein

33
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,920
describing the beginnings of the flavour industry in the 19th century

34
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,040
to Ruth Alexander, presenter of the BBC World Service Program, the food chain.

35
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,600
There's really only a handful of people,

36
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,199
and maybe a dozen or so companies that are really involved.

37
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,680
And at that point, they really are kind of working with secret recipes

38
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,680
that were kept very secure and sometimes passed down

39
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,400
within families from father to son.

40
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,920
So it really seemed like a guild structure from the middle ages at that point.

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,080
Was it seen as some kind of dark art?

42
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,640
Yes, the term black art does come up in some of the early writing

43
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,280
of people who were producing flavours at this point.

44
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,680
To begin with, there were only around a dozen, that's 12,

45
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,960
companies experimenting with food flavours.

46
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,560
The recipes they used were kept secret and only shared with family or trusted friends.

47
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,240
Dr. Berenstein compares these companies to a guild,

48
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,800
an organisation of people who do the same job, or have the same interests.

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,040
Because it was so secretive and mysterious, people saw making flavours as a dark art.

50
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,840
A method of achieving something in a clever but dishonest or wicked way.

51
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,640
But all this changed after the Second World War,

52
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:24,000
when the invention of processed food, which could be bought in supermarkets and kept fresh at home

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,919
in the fridge, increased the demand for new and exciting flavours.

54
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:34,879
Here's Dr. Berenstein again, explaining the work of present day favourists to BBC World Service

55
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:42,159
programme, The Food Chain. So essentially becoming a flavourist today is still an apprenticeship process.

56
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:49,439
There's no academic path to it, right? Your training is on the job, working alongside

57
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:56,079
a master flavourist, at a flavour and fragrance company, or at some of the bigger

58
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:58,879
food companies will have their own flavour divisions.

59
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,800
It's a scientific profession for sure. You have to know a lot about chemistry,

60
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,880
but it is a creative profession. That the very heart of this industrial food system,

61
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:19,360
there's these craft artisans who are essentially designing a molecule by molecule,

62
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,480
the flavours that shape the way that food is made to taste.

63
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,199
Today's flavourists learn their art by serving an apprenticeship.

64
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,160
A period of time spent working for a skilled master, often for low payment,

65
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,120
in order to learn their skills. Although a background in chemistry is important,

66
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,439
you can't study flavours at university. The training happens on the job, actual place of work,

67
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:52,160
while you are working. Dr. Berenstein calls favourists craft artisans, people doing skilled work

68
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,000
with their hands, and she describes their creations as the marriage of science and art.

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,840
Yes, I love the idea of the flavourist as a magician adding a pinch of this flavour or a drop of

70
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:09,119
that oil to create the perfect magical taste. I wonder if that's what British chef

71
00:05:09,119 --> 00:05:14,159
Heston Blumenthal was trying to do. In my question, I asked what popular flavour

72
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:20,799
combination was invented by chef Heston Blumenthal? And I said it was A, dark chocolate and sea salt.

73
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:26,479
So was I right? It's true that sweet and salty flavours go together well, but the correct answer was

74
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,639
white chocolate and caviar. A combination described by Swiss master flavourist,

75
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,319
Francois Benzzi, as weird but wonderful. Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned

76
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:44,800
starting with a dozen, which means twelve. Something described as a dark art refers to a method of

77
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,560
achieving something in a clever but dishonest way. A guild is an organisation of people who do the

78
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,240
same job. An apprenticeship is the period of time an apprentice spends watching and working

79
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,120
with a skilled master in order to learn their skills. When you do something on the job,

80
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,720
it happens in the workplace while you're working. And finally an artisan is a person doing

81
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,680
skilled work with their hands. Once again, our six minutes are up. Bye for now. Bye bye.
