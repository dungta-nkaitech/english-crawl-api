00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,800
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,000
And I'm Georgina.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,240
After working together at BBC Learning English for many years, Georgina,

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,199
you and I have a good working relationship, don't we?

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,600
Sure, I think we make a great team.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,960
But have you ever had a boss who you just couldn't work with?

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,880
Oh, you mean a bad boss?

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,240
Someone you just can't get on with no matter how hard you try.

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,079
Yes, I've had one or two over the years, not you of course, Neil.

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,480
Oh, glad to hear it, Georgina.

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,799
Often this happens because workers feel they aren't listened to by managers,

15
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,480
or it might be because most companies are hierarchies,

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,040
systems of organising people, according to their level of importance.

17
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:58,079
Managers on top workers down below.

18
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,159
But in this programme, we hear from companies who've got rid of managers

19
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:04,400
and say it's helped them to do a better job,

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,719
made them happier and saved money.

21
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,840
We'll meet a self-managing company which isn't hierarchical and has no boss.

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,879
And of course, we'll be learning some new vocabulary along the way.

23
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,599
But first, today's quiz question.

24
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:23,359
One of the biggest problems in hierarchies is the excess cost of management and bureaucracy.

25
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,400
But how much is that estimated to cost the US economy every year?

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,760
Is it a three million dollars, b three billion dollars, or c three trillion dollars?

27
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,280
I'll say c three trillion dollars.

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,840
That's one followed by twelve zeros.

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,879
A lot of money.

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,480
Okay, Georgina, we'll find out later if you're right.

31
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,200
Now, one of the first companies to experiment successfully with self-management

32
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,240
was Californian tomato-grower Morningstar.

33
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,960
Here's one of their employees, Doug Kirkpatrick, talking to Dean and Newman

34
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,719
for the BBC World Service programme People Fixing the World.

35
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,840
The first principle was that human beings should not use force or coercion

36
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,480
against other human beings.

37
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,640
And the second principle was that people should keep the commitments they make to each other.

38
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,719
And so we adopted them as pretty much the entire governance of the enterprise.

39
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,279
Because Morningstar has no bosses, decisions are made by all employees equally without coercion.

40
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:37,119
The use of force to persuade someone to do something they do not want to do.

41
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:42,319
As self-managers, employees can't tell other employees what to do.

42
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,239
Everything is based on requesting someone to act and then responding.

43
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,600
This motivates and empowers workers, but also means they must keep their commitments.

44
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,520
Promises or firm decisions to do something when requested.

45
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,320
This way of working is great for some.

46
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,760
They feel listened to and have a voice in how the company is run.

47
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,240
But, Deena, questions whether this is true for everybody working at Morningstar.

48
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,360
Would it be true to say that the self-managed company like yours empowers people who are already

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,200
very good and it leaves behind those who are not so good?

50
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,520
Yeah, I'm not sure except the praise left behind.

51
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,680
There are some people who take full advantage of this environment.

52
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,080
Others take less advantage, but they do benefit because their voice is respected.

53
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,600
When they do propose something, it must be listened to.

54
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,320
They are not subject to force and coercion.

55
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,120
And if they don't act according to their commitments, they can be held accountable.

56
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,000
By anyone.

57
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,039
Having no bosses sounds great, but the extra responsibility can create more work and stress.

58
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,719
Different workers respond to this in different ways and some employees may be left behind,

59
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,960
remain at a lower level than others because they're not as quick to develop.

60
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,879
However, other workers enjoy managing themselves and take full advantage of the system.

61
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,640
Make good use of the opportunity to improve and achieve their goals.

62
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:15,199
No matter whether employees are good self-managers or not,

63
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,719
ultimately they are held accountable for their work performance,

64
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:22,639
asked to accept responsibility for the consequences of their actions.

65
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,879
So, although having no boss sounds good, if things go wrong, there's no one to blame but yourself.

66
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:35,199
So maybe we do need those managers after all, which reminds me of our quiz question.

67
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:42,639
You asked me to estimate how much the US economy loses in excess bureaucracy and managerial costs every year.

68
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,399
And you said?

69
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,800
See, $3 trillion.

70
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,599
Which was absolutely right, well done.

71
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:53,439
And the cost keeps rising because of course the more managers there are,

72
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,079
the more managers you need to manage, the managers.

73
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,519
Today we've been looking at the world of self-management.

74
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,959
Companies run without bosses, which unlike most businesses are not based on a hierarchy.

75
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,719
System of organising people, according to their level of importance.

76
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,199
Instead, companies like San Francisco's Morningstar allow employees to make their own commitments,

77
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,560
promises to act rather than using coercion or forceful persuasion to get results.

78
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,959
Many employees react positively to this working environment and take full advantage of it,

79
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,279
make good use of the opportunity to progress or achieve their goals.

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,559
However, there is a risk that others who are more comfortable being managed may get left behind.

81
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,599
Remain at a lower level than others because they are not as quick to improve and adapt.

82
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,079
But whatever their job role or feelings about self-management all workers are held accountable,

83
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,279
asked to accept responsibility for their performance at work.

84
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,479
Meaning they can take the credit for when things go well.

85
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:58,799
But have nobody to hide behind when things go badly.

86
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,280
That's all from us today, but remember to join us again soon for more topical discussion
