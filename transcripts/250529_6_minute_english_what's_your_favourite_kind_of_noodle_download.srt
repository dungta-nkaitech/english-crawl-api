00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, this is 6-Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,160
And I'm Beth. Do you enjoy eating noodles, Beth?

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,920
I love noodles, yes. I think my favourite are udon, the big thick ones.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,760
Mmm, they're so good. Well, some people buy them dried in a packet. Others make them fresh from

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,520
wheat or rice, but there is little douts that noodles are popular around the world.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,840
From their origins, probably somewhere in China, noodle recipes were spread by traders on the

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,320
ancient Silk Road. At each destination, along the road, people gave noodles a twist, adding

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,920
different flavours and ingredients to create a new dish.

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,920
In this programme, we'll visit the United States and Japan, two countries which have taken noodles

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,359
and created exciting new varieties. As usual, we'll learn some useful new vocabulary.

12
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,879
And remember, you can read along with the transcript of this programme available now on our website

14
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,640
But first, Neil, I have a question for you. As well as different shapes and ingredients,

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:22,719
noodles come in many different flavours. So which region of China is famous for its spicy flavours?

16
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:23,599
Is it...

17
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:29,039
Shanghai, B, Sichuan or C, Guangzhou?

18
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,519
Well, I think actually Beth, I know the answer to this, who I've been lucky enough

19
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,199
to have been to this place. I think it's B Sichuan.

20
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:43,840
Okay, well, you sound confident. I will reveal the answer later in the programme.

21
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:51,439
BBC World Service programme The Food Chain investigated how noodles spread from Asia through Europe

22
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:58,640
to America. They uncovered a surprising story that pasta comes from noodles brought back to Italy

23
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,840
by Marco Polo in the 13th century.

24
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,759
Jen Lin Liu, author of the book On the Nudal Road, doesn't believe this story.

25
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:14,000
So noodles were very exotic in the 1920s and 30s in the United States.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,560
And there was a new post-association in America that wanted to promote the manufacturing

27
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:29,680
of dried pasta. And so they came up with a story about how Marco Polo went to China and found

28
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,039
the noodle there and brought it all the way to Italy.

29
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:39,360
In the 1920s, noodles were popular because they were exotic, meaning foreign, unusual and exciting.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,960
At that time, pasta companies were promoting a new invention, dried pasta,

31
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,120
so they came up with a story about Marco Polo to sell more pasta.

32
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,439
If you come up with something, you suggest or think up an idea.

33
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,120
And it worked. Sales have passed a jump as a result.

34
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,879
Now our second destination, Japan, also has a history of eating noodles.

35
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,800
One of the most famous Japanese noodle dishes is ramen.

36
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,599
And Frank Striegel, a blogger living in Tokyo, knows all about it.

37
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,759
He eats over 300 bowls of ramen a year.

38
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:23,280
He explained to BBC World Services the food chain how Chinese immigrants to Japan in the late 1800s

39
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,199
influenced this Japanese dish.

40
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,359
Frank says that at one point or another, chefs started to make noodle dishes more Japanese.

41
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,440
Here, the phrase at one point or another means at some unspecified time in the past.

42
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,600
By making these tweaks, adding new toppings and slices of beef or chicken,

43
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,960
Japanese chefs created the noodle dish we know today as ramen.

44
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,080
Here's Frank Striegel again talking with BBC World Services the food chain.

45
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,040
And what I find fascinating about ramen compared to perhaps other wonderful noodle dishes around

46
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,960
the world is that ramen continues to evolve. Unlike other Japanese foods, it's okay to push the

47
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,680
boundaries. Frank thinks that Japanese ramen continues to evolve to develop and change gradually

48
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,759
in response to new developments and ideas. And like other traditional foods such as sushi,

49
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,600
modern versions of ramen push the boundaries. If you push the boundaries, you act in a way which

50
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,520
challenges normal acceptable behaviour. Yes, noodles have changed so much since ancient times

51
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,200
that today you can buy them dried in a packet and simply add hot water. But the flavours and the

52
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,640
noodles themselves maintain a link to the past. Now, speaking of flavours, what was the answer to your

53
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,560
question, bet? Well, I asked you which region of China is famous for its spicy flavours.

54
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,560
You were very confident with saying Sichuan and that is the correct answer.

55
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,879
Sichuan is a place that is famous for spicy food such as the Sichuan pepper and Sichuan hot pot.

56
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:23,120
Okay, it's time to recap the vocabulary we've learnt. If you give something a twist,

57
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,680
you change it in some small way to create something new and exciting.

58
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,199
The adjective exotic means unusual and exciting because of coming from far away.

59
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:38,560
The phrase at one point or another means at some unspecified time in the past.

60
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,639
If you tweak something, you alter it slightly in order to improve it.

61
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,399
Something which evolves, develops and changes gradually.

62
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:52,079
And finally, the idiom to push the boundaries means to do things which challenge normal acceptable

63
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:58,000
behaviour. Once again, our six minutes are up. If you enjoyed the programme, why not visit our
