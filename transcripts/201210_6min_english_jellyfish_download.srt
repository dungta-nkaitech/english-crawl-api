4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,320
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,080
I'm Neil. And I'm Georgina.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,120
Of all the weird and wonderful creatures living under the sea,

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,519
perhaps the strangest are jellyfish.

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,199
Those rubbery, cone-shaped creatures found floating in the water,

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,280
their long tentacles trailing behind.

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,920
Some jellyfish species have a bad reputation for scaring away tourists,

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,079
clogging up fishing nets, and even blocking power station pipes.

12
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,679
But with more and more plastic rubbish ending up in the sea,

13
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,000
these days, you're as likely to swim into a plastic bag as a jellyfish.

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,719
Now scientific research is discovering that these rubbery sea creatures

15
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,280
might provide an answer, a sticky solution to the problem of plastic pollution.

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,200
In this programme, we'll be learning how jellyfish mucous could provide the answer

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,440
to plastic waste in the seas.

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,960
And of course, we'll be learning some related vocabulary along the way.

19
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,280
But first, it's time for my quiz question.

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,240
Georgina, you mentioned jellyfish scaring away beachgoers with their sting,

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,120
but what is the best way to treat jellyfish stings?

22
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,960
Is it A? With ice?

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,600
B? With salt or C? With vinegar?

24
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,079
Well, Neil, I have been stung by jellyfish before,

25
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,159
and I think the best way to treat them is C with vinegar.

26
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,800
Okay, Georgina, we'll find out later if that's right.

27
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,560
Now, as I mentioned, in recent years, tiny pieces of plastic,

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,759
called microplastic, have been a significant problem for the world's seas and oceans.

29
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,640
They've been found all over the world in Arctic ice,

30
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,719
at the bottom of the sea, and even inside animals, including humans.

31
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,400
Slovenian scientist Dr. Anna Rotter heads Go Jelly,

32
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,879
a European research team of jellyfish ecologists looking into the problem.

33
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:58,159
Here she is speaking to BBC World Service programme People Fixing the World.

34
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:04,159
Microplastics plastics, in general, are being an increasing problem there everywhere.

35
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,800
When I was a little girl, we were more environmentally friendly, not knowing.

36
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,519
So, we never used plastic bags to go shopping.

37
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:14,719
We always went with cloth bags.

38
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,359
We never used plastic to put our vegetables in it.

39
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:20,719
Single-use spoons or forks, knives.

40
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,519
This is for me something unheard of when I was a little girl.

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,159
Dr. Rotter says when she was a child, people were more environmentally friendly,

42
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,400
not harmful to the environment, or having the least possible impact on it.

43
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,000
At that time, there were very few single-use plastics.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,920
Plastic items like spoons and forks, designed to be used just once, then thrown away.

45
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,120
Single-use plastic bags, for example, were unheard of,

46
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,520
surprising or shocking because they were not previously known about or commonly used.

47
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,040
The situation since then has changed dramatically.

48
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,359
In fact, there's been such an increase in microplastics that today,

49
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:04,560
the UN lists plastic pollution as one of the world's top environmental threats.

50
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,039
But how do jellyfish fit into the story?

51
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,239
Well, it's the jelly part of jellyfish, and specifically,

52
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,199
there's sticky jelly-like mucus that is key.

53
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,879
Here's Dr. Rotter again explaining more to BBC World Service programme People Fixing the World.

54
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:26,240
The mucus, this is like a viscous substance that is being excreted from jellyfish,

55
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,159
might have the, they are called the absorberative properties.

56
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,359
So it means that the particles, various particles, can attach to this mucus.

57
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:43,359
So could we use jellyfish and their mucus as a magnet for the microplastic particles?

58
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:47,280
Jellyfish produce a thick sticky liquid called mucus.

59
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,400
Dr. Rotter has discovered that this mucus has strong absorbed properties.

60
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,120
It can absorb, taken liquids and other substances and hold them in.

61
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,400
One of the substances jellyfish mucus absorbs are the particles that make up microplastics.

62
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,759
By trapping these tiny pieces of floating plastic, the mucus acts like a magnet,

63
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:13,120
an object that attracts certain materials like metal, or in this case, microplastic waste.

64
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,959
As rising sea temperatures and overfishing of their natural predators

65
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,199
have boosted jellyfish numbers, this novel way of using their mucus

66
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,040
couldn't have come at a better time.

67
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,680
Dr. Rotter's research is still in the early stages,

68
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,439
but it's hoped that jellyfish mucus could hold the key to a future free of microplastic

69
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,720
polluted oceans.

70
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,480
Which is a big prize for the cost of a few jellyfish things.

71
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,560
Speaking of which, Neil, what was the correct answer to your quiz question?

72
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,360
Right, I asked you the best way to treat jellyfish stings.

73
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,720
What did you say to Regina?

74
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,519
I said it's C with vinegar.

75
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,079
Which is the right answer. Well done.

76
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,879
Vinegar inactivates the stings venom.

77
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,720
So remember to pack a bottle of vinegar the next time you head to the beach.

78
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,680
In this program, we've been hearing how scientists are using jellyfish mucus,

79
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,199
a thick sticky liquid produced in their bodies to break down microplastics in the sea.

80
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,920
Our addiction to single-use plastics, plastic items which are used only once,

81
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,439
then thrown away, and which often get washed out to sea,

82
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:20,159
has created a situation which is definitely not environmentally friendly.

83
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:23,120
That means having a minimal impact on the environment.

84
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,360
Until quite recently, the problems of micro pollution and single-use plastic were unheard of,

85
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,519
surprising or shocking because of not having been previously known about.

86
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:37,039
Scientists are hoping that the mucus' absorptive qualities,

87
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:41,680
its ability to absorb liquids and other substances and hold them,

88
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,359
will allow it to track particles of plastic floating in the sea,

89
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:48,399
making jellyfish mucus a magnet for pollution,

90
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,359
an object that attracts certain materials, usually metals,

91
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:53,519
but in this case, microplastic waste.

92
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,719
That's all for this program, but to hear more about how these amazing

93
00:05:56,719 --> 00:06:01,680
