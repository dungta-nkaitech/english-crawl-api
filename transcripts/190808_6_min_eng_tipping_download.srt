From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,719
Hello, this is 6-Mate English and I'm Catherine.

6
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:17,760
And I'm Sam.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,480
Sam, how do you feel about tipping?

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,640
Tipping. You mean giving extra money to people in certain jobs for doing their jobs?

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,320
Well, I wouldn't put it quite like that, but yes, it's giving money to waiters and waitresses,

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,640
hairdressers, taxi drivers.

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,159
Money, that's more than the actual bill.

12
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,439
It's a nightmare.

13
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:47,920
I never know who to tip, how to tip by cash or by card, how much to tip, is it 10, 12.5, 20%

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,840
or even if I should tip at all, because in some places a service charge is automatically added to the bill.

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,520
Yes, tipping is a really complicated issue, which we'll be looking at in this program.

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,880
But to start with, a question, what is the biggest tip that we know that somebody gave?

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,920
Is it a $10,000?

18
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,520
Is it B $250,000?

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,560
US dollars?

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,800
Or is it C $3 million?

21
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,760
US dollars?

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,200
What do you think Sam?

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,640
I'm going to go for $250,000.

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,320
Okay, well, we'll find out if you're right at the end of the program.

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,760
Now, back to the topic of tipping, and in particular, tipping people who work in restaurants.

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,879
William Beckett runs a number of restaurants, and he recently appeared on the BBC Food Programme.

27
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,439
He was asked about his view of tipping.

28
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,359
Now, as we hear him, listen out for this information.

29
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:52,959
In how many cities does he say he currently has restaurants?

30
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,760
It is cultural.

31
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,920
IE, it differs from place to place.

32
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,400
I mean, we have restaurants in London, with a restaurant in Manchester.

33
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,079
We're also opening a restaurant in New York.

34
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,680
And those three cities have quite different attitudes to tipping.

35
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,840
In London, the norm is...

36
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,840
Well, it's there, it's on your bill.

37
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,079
That's not the norm, for example, in Manchester.

38
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,480
And it's not the norm in New York, where we're going to open a restaurant later this year.

39
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,160
So, first, how many cities does he currently have restaurants in?

40
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,000
That would be two, London and Manchester.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,960
He's going to open one in New York later in the year, but it's not open yet.

42
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,280
And what does he say about tipping?

43
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,680
Well, he says that it's very cultural.

44
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,920
What is the norm in one city?

45
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,560
Is not necessarily the norm in another.

46
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:50,240
The norm is an expression that means, as you might guess, what is normal?

47
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,280
What is usual?

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,879
So, in London, for example, a service charge is usually added to the bill,

49
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,560
but in Manchester, it isn't.

50
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,280
So, the policy in London and Manchester differs, which means, again, as you might guess,

51
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,719
it's different.

52
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,000
There's another short expression that he used that I'd like to highlight.

53
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,360
Before he talks about how the policy is differ, he says i.e.

54
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,159
These two letters stand for the Latin phrase id-est.

55
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,520
Now, we never say id-est, but we do write and say i.e.

56
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:32,879
We use it to show that what comes next is using different words to say what we have just said or written.

57
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,879
So, he says about tipping, it's cultural.

58
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,199
i.e. it differs from place to place.

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,239
Its cultural is a more general statement and it differs from place to place

60
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,639
is a more specific definition of what he means.

61
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:52,879
So, one difference is that in some places, people prefer an automatic service charge

62
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,560
so that they don't have to think about or try to calculate a tip.

63
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,159
But in other places, people hate that.

64
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,199
They want to decide who and how much to tip themselves.

65
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,599
But do people actually make use of that freedom not to tip?

66
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,680
Here's William Bucket again and this time he's talking about New York.

67
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,000
New York, exactly the same.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,120
There's a tacit pressure to tip, but theoretically you just stand up and walk out.

69
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,759
You don't, everybody tips 20% or there is a theory of an option.

70
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,800
But people like that.

71
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,519
So, he says there is a tacit pressure to tip.

72
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,879
What does he mean by that?

73
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,040
Something that is tacit is not spoken, not said.

74
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,960
Yes, this is still understood.

75
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,160
So, in New York, no one tells you that you have to tip,

76
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,000
but everyone knows that you have to.

77
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,120
And because there's no service charge on the bill and no one tells you what to tip,

78
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,760
you could just walk out after paying.

79
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,879
He says that's theoretically possible.

80
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,360
That means although it may be possible, it's actually very unlikely because of the tacit

81
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,280
pressure and the way we behave.

82
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,199
But he does say people like that freedom not to tip, even if they don't actually use that

83
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,000
freedom.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,519
Right, nearly vocabulary time, but first let's have the answer to our question.

85
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,879
Now Sam, what is the biggest tip we know someone gave?

86
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,959
I thought 250,000.

87
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:29,439
Well, it was actually believe it or not, a whopping $3 million US dollars, yes.

88
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,799
Now, on with today's vocabulary review.

89
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,120
Right, so we've been talking about tipping,

90
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,600
the practice of giving extra money to, for example, waitresses and waiters.

91
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,319
To differ from is a verb, which means to be different from.

92
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,240
The norm is what is usual or normal.

93
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,160
IE is a short form of a Latin expression and it means in other words.

94
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,840
Something that is tacit is not said, but is nevertheless understood.

95
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:05,439
And if something is theoretically possible, it can be done, but for different reasons,

96
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,719
it probably won't be.

97
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,919
And that is where we must leave it today.

98
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,879
Goodbye.

99
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,519
Bye, everyone.
