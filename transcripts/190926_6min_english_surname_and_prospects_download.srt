5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,960
Hello, this is 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,919
And I'm Sam.

7
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,120
Now Sam, I assume that you know your alphabet.

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,240
Of course, Neil, you mean my ABCs?

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,719
We learn that at a very young age, you know.

10
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,320
Sorry to sound patronising, but you do know why the letters in the alphabet

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,240
are in that particular order.

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,880
No, I don't. That's really interesting why?

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,359
I don't know either. I was hoping you might.

14
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,600
But seriously, no one really knows how the order became established.

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,920
However, some research has shown that if your surname, your family name,

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,960
begins with a letter later in the alphabet,

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,640
you could be at a disadvantage at school and in life.

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,719
Before we get into that, though, a question.

19
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,200
Where does the alphabet come from in its earliest form?

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,760
Was it A ancient Egypt, B ancient Greece or C ancient Rome?

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,280
What do you think, Sam?

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,079
Well, we refer to the English alphabet as having Roman characters,

23
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:10,560
so I'm going with ancient Rome.

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,359
Okay, well, I'll have the answer later in the programme.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,120
In the BBC Radio programme, Fries English Delight,

26
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,719
there was a feature about the alphabet and how it can have a negative impact on your school life.

27
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,359
Can you remember all those years ago when you were at school?

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,680
What's the first thing that the teacher would do at the beginning of the day?

29
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,079
She would take the register, or that's what we call it in the UK.

30
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,560
You can also call it the roll call.

31
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes, this is when the teacher calls out the names to the students

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,519
to check that they are all there.

33
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,879
This is where the problem starts, according to,

34
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,359
ironically, Professor Jeffrey Zack's from the University of Colorado.

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,560
The further down that list your name is, the less noticed you are by the teacher.

36
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,680
Why is that?

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,960
Here's Professor Zack's.

38
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,640
When it begins, people are paying attention.

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,000
As it proceeds, first, the people who are already called,

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
they no longer have any need to take the thing seriously.

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,960
And the people who are waiting to be called,

42
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,800
their attention is wandering as well.

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,520
And so, as you make your way through the roll call,

44
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,599
somehow the intensity of the engagement diminishes.

45
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,159
So, what is the problem?

46
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,280
Well, it's a lot to do with paying attention.

47
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,400
This means concentrating on something.

48
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,799
At the beginning of the roll call, everyone is paying attention.

49
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:36,479
They are quiet and listening.

50
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,879
But after the first names are called,

51
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,439
those students don't need to pay attention anymore.

52
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,639
So, they lose a bit of interest in what comes next.

53
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,400
And the students later in the list are also now distracted.

54
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,599
And the teacher, he more herself, is not so focused.

55
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,360
And by the end of the list, the relationship between the teacher

56
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,560
and the students whose names are being called later

57
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,920
is not as strong as those at the beginning of the list.

58
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,200
Professor Zack describes this by saying that the intensity of the engagement diminishes.

59
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,680
Diminishes means gets weaker.

60
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,599
And the intensity of the engagement is the strength of the communication,

61
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,159
the level of enthusiasm for being involved.

62
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,280
So, this is the start of the disadvantage

63
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,199
which can subtly affect students throughout their school years and after.

64
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,759
This was discovered after some research in the US in the 1950s.

65
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,319
So, what were these disadvantages?

66
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,000
His Professor Zack's again.

67
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,560
They were less likely to have enjoyed their high school courses.

68
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,560
Graduated from college if they applied,

69
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
they were more likely to drop out.

70
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,680
They had first jobs in occupations that paid less.

71
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,879
They were more likely to go to the military.

72
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,879
And they were more likely to have jobs whose prestige was lower.

73
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,240
So, what disadvantages did they have?

74
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,960
Well, Professor Zack says that the research showed they enjoyed school less,

75
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:07,200
were less successful academically and more likely to drop out of college or university.

76
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,719
This means that they left the course before it was finished.

77
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,680
And he also said that they were more likely to find jobs

78
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,920
that had a lower prestige.

79
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,840
This means the jobs weren't seen as high status or desirable.

80
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,720
Let's listen again.

81
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,120
They were less likely to have enjoyed their high school courses.

82
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Graduated from college if they applied.

83
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,199
They were more likely to drop out.

84
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,240
They had first jobs in occupations that paid less.

85
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,280
They were more likely to go to the military.

86
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,280
And they were more likely to have jobs whose prestige was lower.

87
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:45,599
Well, Professor Zack seems to have done okay.

88
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:47,039
Even with that surname.

89
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:50,239
Indeed, I guess this doesn't apply to everyone.

90
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:53,519
Right, well, before we remind ourselves of our vocabulary,

91
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,599
let's get the answer to the question.

92
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:59,439
Where does the alphabet come from in its earliest form?

93
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:05,279
Was it A, Ancient Egypt, B, Ancient Greece or C, Ancient Rome? Sam, what did you say?

94
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,759
Pretty sure it's Ancient Rome.

95
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,279
What does your surname begin with?

96
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:11,439
A B, actually.

97
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,199
Well, you're wrong, I'm afraid.

98
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,279
It's actually Ancient Egypt.

99
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:17,839
So well done to everyone who got that.

100
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,639
Okay, now it's time for our vocabulary.

101
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,279
Yes. To pay attention to something

102
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,279
means to concentrate on something to not be distracted.

103
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,479
Then there was the phrase the intensity of the engagement,

104
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,839
which is another way of saying the strength of the relationship, interaction and communication.

105
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,639
And if your surname comes at the end of the alphabet,

106
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:44,159
you may find that the intensity of engagement with the teacher diminishes.

107
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,639
Diminishes means get weaker.

108
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,800
If you drop out from a course, it means that you leave it before it's finished.

109
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,800
And the prestige of a job is the respect it has.

110
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,599
If it's as seen as important or desirable, then it has higher prestige.

111
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:02,240
Okay, thank you, Sam. That's all from six minute English.

112
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
We hope you can join us again soon.
