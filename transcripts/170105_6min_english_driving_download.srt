00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,280
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,199
And I'm Neil. What do you think about autonomous cars, Alice?

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,280
Mmm, an autonomous or independent and driverless car

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,560
is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,800
and navigating without human input.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,640
I think they're a great idea.

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,359
A navigate means to find the way to get to a place.

11
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:35,600
I'm not sure I would trust a computer to drive me.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,520
It might go wrong and crash into a wall.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,679
Maybe, but actually most car accidents involve an element of human error.

14
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,519
And human error means the mistakes we make because we're human.

15
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:52,880
For example, people who are behind the wheel while tired or drunk or distracted.

16
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,159
Behind the wheel, in other words, in control of a car.

17
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,599
Yes, I often see people talking on their mobile phones or texting

18
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:01,439
instead of looking at the road.

19
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,759
They're being irresponsible drivers, Neil.

20
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,879
Driving is the subject of today's show.

21
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,560
I have a question for you.

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,759
On average, how many people around the world die each day from road accidents?

23
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:20,239
Is it A, 300, B, 3000 or C, 30,000?

24
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,719
And I'm going to say B, 3000.

25
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,319
Well, we'll see if you're right or not later on in the show.

26
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,239
Are you a petrolhead, Neil?

27
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,840
No, I'm not a petrolhead, which is someone who loves cars and driving.

28
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,719
But I know Eddie Jordan, a racing team owner, is.

29
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,680
And what does he love about driving?

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,359
He'll answer this question himself.

31
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:39,920
Let's listen.

32
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:43,840
When I get in a car, I feel a different person.

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,920
I feel that I'm now in control.

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,319
I can turn on the music or I can turn it off.

35
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,280
I can do all sorts of different things that I feel good about.

36
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,079
When I was flat out with the Jordan team, I did have a driver.

37
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,480
And that was one to be able to make calls and to be able to receive calls and to be able to work in the car.

38
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,079
Not because I didn't want to drive.

39
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,040
And I always felt cheap that there was a driver there taking the pleasure that I should be having.

40
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,680
So when I get in the car, it has to be a fun experience.

41
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:11,920
Eddie Jordan there.

42
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,520
And doing something flat out means that maximum capacity.

43
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,159
Do you feel like a different person when you're driving, Alice?

44
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:18,960
No.

45
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,960
And unlike Eddie Jordan,

46
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,560
I'd love to have a driver or a driverless car for that matter.

47
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,000
It gives you time to do other things like getting some work done.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,360
I certainly wouldn't feel cheated of the pleasure of driving.

49
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,120
I agree with Eddie Jordan.

50
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,640
I would feel a bit cheated.

51
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,520
And I have to admit, I'm a bit of a backseat driver.

52
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,040
I sit in the passenger seat and give the driver unwanted advice.

53
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,719
Well, just think, Neil.

54
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,159
In a driverless car, you wouldn't need to give the computer advice

55
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,400
because it would be making the right decisions to get you to your destination safely.

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,960
But can you override the computer, you know,

57
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,599
if you felt that it was making bad decisions?

58
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,360
Uber ride in this context means to stop an automatic action

59
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,879
by taking control yourself.

60
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,759
airline pilots do that, don't they?

61
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,560
They fly on autopilot for most of the journey,

62
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,800
but override it in order to take control of the plane for takeoff and landing.

63
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,439
I would feel happier if I could take back control of an automated car if I wanted to.

64
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,360
Well, let's listen now to Brian Fung, a technology reporter

65
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,000
who's experienced what it is to be in a driverless car that has no steering wheels,

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,440
no brake pedals, no emergency brake, no gear shifter.

67
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,160
Google is developing a car in which everything will be self-contained.

68
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,800
Well, the biggest thing you notice right off the bat is that

69
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,120
the car accelerates a little bit more aggressively than a regular car might,

70
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,880
and it breaks a little bit more aggressively than a regular car might.

71
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,320
But other than that, it takes about 10 seconds for you to get

72
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,000
pretty comfortable.

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,959
And the car knew how to stop for red lights.

74
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,599
It knew how to run through yellow lights.

75
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,359
It could detect pedestrians and navigate its way around parked cars.

76
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:06,639
All in all, it felt very similar to a regular car driving experience.

77
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:11,199
And I think that's one of the most surprising and exciting things about it is

78
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,319
just how mundane it was.

79
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,439
Brian Fung says he noticed right off the bat that the Google car

80
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,879
accelerated and brake more aggressively than a regular car,

81
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,439
and right off the bat means immediately.

82
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:29,120
But he also says it took him only 10 seconds to get used to it and feel comfortable.

83
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,839
As the car navigated appropriately and responded to different traffic situations,

84
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,800
including pedestrians and parked cars.

85
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,279
Well, that all sounds very nice, but I think I'd still prefer to be in the driving seat.

86
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,720
And that means in control of a situation, you can take the driverless car and do your work, Alice.

87
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,400
Well, the future is likely to be all about automated transport.

88
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,560
Plains, trains, buses and cars, and you simply won't have a choice, Neil.

89
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,640
Maybe you'll be allowed to hire a car.

90
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,400
You can drive yourself just for fun.

91
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,440
Maybe.

92
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,040
But I like the idea of a future with safe driverless roads.

93
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,560
I still need some convincing.

94
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,880
And that brings us back to today's quiz question.

95
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,200
Can you tell us the answer now, please, Alice?

96
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,400
Of course I can.

97
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:18,959
I asked, on average, around how many people around the world die each day from road accidents.

98
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:25,199
Is it A, 300, B, 3000 or C, 30,000?

99
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,479
And I said 3000.

100
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,000
And unfortunately, Neil, that's right.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,319
Nearly 1.3 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day.

102
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,919
That's according to annual global road crash statistics.

103
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,920
Now, here are the words we learned today.

104
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,600
Autonomous.

105
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,600
Navigate.

106
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,520
Human error.

107
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,680
Behind the wheel.

108
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,600
Petrol head.

109
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,759
Flat out.

110
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,000
Backseat driver.

111
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,000
Override.

112
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,000
Right off the bat.

113
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,160
In the driving seat.

114
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,040
And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

115
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,040
Don't forget to join us again soon.

116
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,840
Goodbye.

117
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,639
Bye.

118
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,639
6 Minute English.

119
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,839
