Hello, this is 6-Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:12,800
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,000
There are many ways of saying sorry in English and they all have a slightly different meaning.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,640
If you tell me you're ill and I say, oh, I'm sorry, that means I sympathise and I hope you get better soon.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,440
If you step on my toes by mistake and say, I'm so sorry, you mean, oops,

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,000
that was my fault and I didn't mean to do it.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,679
And if you don't really feel sorry, you might be sarcastic.

9
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:41,359
Oh, I'm so sorry, meaning exactly the opposite, that you're not sorry at all.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,079
Saying sorry for something you've done in English can be quite confusing.

11
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,799
And to make things worse, the British are world champions at apologising.

12
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,560
In this programme, we'll discuss ways of saying sorry.

13
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,480
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

14
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,599
Sorry, but I'm going to have to stop you there, Beth, because first I have a question to ask.

15
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:06,079
We know that the British love to say sorry.

16
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,759
In fact, a recent survey found that some Brits apologise up to 20 times a day.

17
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:19,120
So, according to the same survey, how many times per day does the average Brit say sorry?

18
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:26,239
Is it a four times a day, b six times a day or c eight times a day?

19
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:29,679
I'm going to guess it's six times a day.

20
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:32,640
Okay, Beth, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

21
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,959
Since the British are famous for apologising, it's no surprise that Louise Malaney started

22
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:44,000
researching the language of apologising in Britain at the University of Nottingham.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,159
Now, a professor of socio-linguistics, Louise spoke with the BBC Radio 4 programme, Word of

24
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,239
and I was really interested in looking at how people apologise, particularly public figures.

25
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:01,039
So, I did a lot of research in the workplace and looking at the media and looking at politicians

26
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:05,920
in particular. And one of the things that really interested me at the time was a lot of writers

27
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,199
were talking about as entering an age of an apology. And there's a real sense that public figures

28
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,919
in particular are called upon to apologise for multiple different things. And if they don't

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,119
apologise, then that's a big faux pas.

30
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:25,119
Saying sorry is especially important in politics, and Professor Malaney studied the apologies

31
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:31,599
of public figures, famous people, including politicians who are often discussed in newspapers

32
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:38,719
and seen on radio and television. When politicians make mistakes, they are expected to apologise,

33
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:45,519
and failing to say sorry is a faux pas, a remark made in a social situation that causes embarrassment

34
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:52,480
or offence. Most politicians hate apologising, and with good reason, saying sorry means taking

35
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,640
responsibility, and the apology needs to be sincere. A good example of this is the apology

36
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,879
Boris Johnson made to the House of Commons during the party gate scandal in the UK when he broke

37
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:11,200
Covid lockdown rules and had to pay a fine. That's a sum of money paid as a punishment for breaking

38
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:18,319
the rules. Here, Professor Louise Malaney analyses the apology for BBC Radio 4 programme, word of

39
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,000
mouth. It's very unusual in a political apology because he comes out and says, I am responsible.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,839
But there is the caveat that he wasn't certain that he was breaking the rules, he didn't realise,

41
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:36,239
which he continues to say in his apology that came out after the fine. So he repeats the apology,

42
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:43,040
and he caveats it around other political events. And he uses humility when he was in the House

43
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,439
the day after he paid his fine and was very quick to say, I've paid the fine, I've given the

44
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,560
reparation, I've paid the money, let's draw a line under the whole business now.

45
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:59,520
Boris Johnson claimed he didn't know he was breaking the rules. His apology contained a caveat,

46
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,960
a warning that what he said was limited or not completely true. Eventually,

47
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:11,040
Boris Johnson did apologise, but many people didn't trust him, and he couldn't draw a line

48
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,040
under the party gate scandal. If you draw a line under something, you try to move on from a bad

49
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,199
situation and make a fresh start. Apologising is hard work, the apology must be sincere and often

50
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,800
the person does something to show they mean it. Which reminds me that it's time to reveal the

51
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:35,520
answer to my question, Beth. Yes, you asked me how many times a day the average Brit says sorry,

52
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,840
and I guessed it was six, was I right? Well, I'm very sorry, but that was the wrong answer.

53
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,840
The average Brit says sorry around eight times a day, making it probably the most overused word

54
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,199
in the English language. Sorry about that. Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from

55
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,439
this programme about saying sorry, starting with sarcastic, doing or saying the opposite of what

56
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:06,319
you really mean. For example, saying I'm really sorry when you aren't. A public figure is a famous

57
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:12,639
person whose life and behaviour is often discussed in the media and in public. A faux pas is a socially

58
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,639
embarrassing remark or action. A fine is a sum of money paid as a punishment for doing something

59
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:24,639
illegal or breaking a rule. If you say something with a caveat, it contains a warning that what

60
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,800
you have said may not be completely true or is limited in some way. And finally, if you draw a

61
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,599
line under something you consider it finished in order to move on and make a fresh start.

62
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:41,039
I'm sorry to say that once again our six minutes are up and it's time to draw a line under this

63
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:47,039
programme. Goodbye for now. Bye. Sorry everyone, we haven't finished yet. Oh yeah, sorry, we want to

64
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,600
tell you about some of our other podcasts. Actually, we shouldn't have to apologise because the other

65
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,560
podcasts are brilliant. True. You can learn vocabulary from news headlines and news review.
