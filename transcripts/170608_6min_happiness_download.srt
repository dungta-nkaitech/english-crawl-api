6-Nate English from the BBC.

4
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:11,919
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English,

5
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:13,839
the show that brings you an interesting topic,

6
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,519
authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary.

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,160
I'm Dan.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,199
And I'm Neil.

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,359
In this episode, we'll be discussing if happiness is genetic.

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,359
How happy would you say you are, Neil?

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,080
I'm pretty happy, I think. Why do you ask?

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,879
Well, in March this year, the UN published its fifth World Happiness Report.

13
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:36,719
Is that the one that ranks all the countries based on how happy they are?

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,399
Oh, you've heard of it then.

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,280
Overall, there are 155 countries included,

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,719
and Norway came top of them all, overtaking Denmark,

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,480
which was the leader for the year's 2012 to 2016.

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,000
Well, what about the UK then?

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,079
Ah, well, that's this week's question, isn't it?

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,480
Where did the UK place?

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,920
Is it A in the top 10, B between 11th

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,280
and 20th, or C after 21st?

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,280
Well, I'm going to say C after 21st.

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,040
Okay, you know the drill, no answers until the end of the show.

25
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,480
So Norway, eh?

26
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,120
And Denmark the previous year, their neighbours.

27
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,520
Yes, in fact, for the last five years,

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,920
the results have been pretty much the same.

29
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,040
Nordic countries tend to dominate the top of the table.

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,799
Dominate, meaning control.

31
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,560
Okay, well, how are the results decided?

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,920
It's very simple.

33
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,719
They ask 1,000 people in each country a single subjective question.

34
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,760
Subjective means based on personal experience,

35
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,439
beliefs or feelings.

36
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,879
Well, what's the question?

37
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,400
Imagine a ladder with steps numbered from zero at the bottom

38
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,240
to 10 at the top.

39
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,680
The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you,

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,680
and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you.

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,560
On which step of the ladder would you say

42
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,600
you personally feel you stand at this time?

43
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,000
That's actually quite simple.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,200
Yep, the Nordic countries all score an average close to 7.5 out of 10.

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,600
So we have a number of neighbouring countries

46
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,840
which all claim to be extremely happy.

47
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,360
There must be a connection.

48
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,400
Is it the weather?

49
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,319
Well, that's a logical conclusion,

50
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,240
but there is another idea.

51
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,400
I'll let Professor Andrew Oswald from the University of Warwick explain.

52
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,319
We think that there's a genetic component in part

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,159
to why the Danes do so well,

54
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,919
coming so regularly at the head of happiness,

55
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,519
international league tables.

56
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,039
It does appear from the data that the Danes have

57
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,000
the smallest amount of the, you might say,

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,879
dangerous, short kind of genetic pattern.

59
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,680
So they may have a kind of inoculation against the possibility of depression.

60
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,919
So Professor Oswald mentioned there's a genetic component

61
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,159
or part to Danish DNA,

62
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,240
which gives them an inoculation

63
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,360
or illness protection against depression and sadness.

64
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,800
Yep, all of the Nordic countries have a similar makeup,

65
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,960
but he said in part, that means it doesn't explain everything.

66
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,400
So there's something missing.

67
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,480
There's no fooling you.

68
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,600
Michael Booth has written a book about Nordic happiness.

69
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,360
He has another theory.

70
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,680
There are so many reasons why the Danes are happy,

71
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,480
why they're content,

72
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,240
that have nothing to do with DNA.

73
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,360
Of course they're happy.

74
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,080
They're rich, they're sexy, they're funny,

75
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,280
they don't work that much.

76
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,600
So being rich, funny, sexy and not working much

77
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,000
is why they're content, meaning satisfied.

78
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,000
That sounds a bit like you, Dan.

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,680
Oh, I can't publicly comment on that,

80
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,640
me, and I'm sorry,

81
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,120
but there is one more piece that we're missing.

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,480
Hugga.

83
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,000
It's a lone word,

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,719
and it only just appeared in the British dictionaries.

85
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,640
We don't have a direct translation,

86
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,680
but it basically means cosiness.

87
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,120
Cosiness, meaning warm, comfortable and safe.

88
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,080
Yes, Danes love simple comforts.

89
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,920
A warm, cozy room,

90
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,879
some drinks, some candles, a fire,

91
00:03:58,879 --> 00:03:59,520
and they're happy.

92
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,520
Maybe that's the secret.

93
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,600
Well, the secret to my happiness right now

94
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,840
is finding out if I was right in the quiz.

95
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,400
Oh, yes.

96
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,000
I asked,

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,840
where did the UK place

98
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,719
in the World Happiness Report 2017?

99
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,080
A in the top 10,

100
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,319
B between 11th and 20th,

101
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,800
or C after 21st.

102
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,560
I said C after 21st.

103
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,560
And I'm afraid you're wrong, my friend.

104
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,120
We placed B between 11th and 20th.

105
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,120
We were actually 19th.

106
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
Well, let's make our listeners happy

107
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,040
by going through the vocabulary.

108
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,519
Okay.

109
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,160
First, we had dominate.

110
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,000
If you dominate something or someone,

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,040
you control it.

112
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,800
It's quite an aggressive word.

113
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,120
You wouldn't use it for people much,

114
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,720
but give us an example, Neil.

115
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,480
You can talk about a team dominating play in a sport.

116
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,480
Next, we had subjective.

117
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,759
If something is subjective,

118
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,599
it is based on personal experience,

119
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:53,039
beliefs or feelings,

120
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:54,399
rather than facts,

121
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,920
which are objective.

122
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,399
What type of things are subjective, Dan?

123
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,800
Oh, it's our opinions of art,

124
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
music, jokes, food.

125
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,199
Oh, you know, I like sausages and ice cream,

126
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,159
but no one else does.

127
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:07,839
Yes, because it's disgusting.

128
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,680
Then we had component.

129
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,360
A component is part of something

130
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,519
that makes up a larger whole.

131
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,319
Television's and computers have many components in them.

132
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,800
And a person can be an essential component

133
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,040
in a team like a goalkeeper in football.

134
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,520
After that was inoculation.

135
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,560
An inoculation is a form of disease protection.

136
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,960
It is a synonym of Dan.

137
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,759
Vaccination.

138
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,759
I went on holiday last year

139
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,480
and I had to have my inoculations updated.

140
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,199
Then we had content.

141
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,480
If you are content, you are satisfied and want nothing.

142
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,319
What makes you content, Neil?

143
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,240
Oh, a warm, sunny day in my garden with a good book.

144
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,560
And finally we had cosiness.

145
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,960
Cosiness comes from cosy, which means warm, comfortable and safe.

146
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,400
Where's cosy for you, Dan?

147
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,280
Oh, that's easy.

148
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,879
On a freezing cold day,

149
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,199
it's tucked up in bed with a nice cup of tea.

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,280
Please join us again soon.

152
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,199
And we're on social media too, of course.

153
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,759
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.

154
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,400
See you there.

155
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,120
Bye-bye.

156
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,600
Bye.
