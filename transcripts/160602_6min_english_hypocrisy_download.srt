5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,679
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:16,719
And I'm Rob.

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,400
Did I see you arriving in a huge red pickup truck this morning?

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,559
Oh yes, it's great, isn't it?

9
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,480
It's very big and red.

10
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:31,039
But Rob, aren't you a supporter of the movement to preserve the environment?

11
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,079
Uh, yes.

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,039
A gas-guzzling car for an environmentalist, Rob.

13
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,480
Isn't that a contradiction? Aren't you being hypocrite?

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,399
Well, it's very fuel-efficient, Alice.

15
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,519
It's quite eco-friendly, actually.

16
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:48,880
Oh, that's ridiculous. And you know it.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,079
Hypocrisy is the subject of today's show.

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,760
And maybe we should start by exploring the meaning of hypocrite.

19
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,239
Can you tell me what did the ancient Greek word hypocrite originally mean?

20
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,920
Was it A, actor, B, politician or C, horse?

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,200
Okay, that's easy. I think it's B, politician.

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,599
Well, we'll find out whether you got the answer right or not later in the show.

23
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:23,199
Now, these days, the meaning has changed and hypocrite means somebody who says one thing and does another.

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,680
Like you telling me not to bite my nails because it's a disgusting habit,

25
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,320
and then I see you doing it later the same day.

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,240
Well, sometimes it's hard to be consistent.

27
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,879
I do think nail biting is disgusting, but then when I'm a bit nervous,

28
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,320
I do it without thinking.

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,159
Yes, we're often inconsistent in what we say or do though, aren't we?

30
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:44,640
Yes.

31
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,040
Inconsistent means changeable.

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,760
There is an explanation for us sometimes saying one thing and behaving in a very different way.

33
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,200
Let's listen to Professor Clancy Martin at the University of Missouri in the US.

34
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,439
He teaches philosophy so he knows a thing or two about the way we think.

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:10,319
So while you might be enormously compassionate in your role as a teacher or a parent,

36
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:17,680
you might find yourself being quite harsh and direct when it comes to your role as a brother or

37
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:24,000
a sister. So then you see that now wait a second, if I've got all these inconsistencies all over

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,400
the place in my character, can I really say that I am a sincere and authentic individual or am I

39
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,280
just kind of blowing with whichever way my relationship wins kind of incline me?

40
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,439
Professor Clancy Martin, so we play different roles in life and these roles may seem contradictory,

41
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,400
but they're just part of being the same person. Sometimes you're a bit harsh and direct with me,

42
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Alice, aren't you? Do you see yourself as my sister? She used to pick on me.

43
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,599
Harsh means stern and unkind. I don't mean to be unkind to you, Rob.

44
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,479
Or maybe I could try and be more compassionate towards you. It means show a bit of sympathy and

45
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,599
concern now and then.

46
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,520
Hmm, offer me good words. At least promise you'll be nice to me. That you'll bring me tea and biscuits.

47
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:16,400
Oh, well that's what politicians do. They promise they will do what people want and often they don't.

48
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,760
And it's a big problem for them. Let's talk about politicians and hypocrisy.

49
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,920
They have to express opinions about so many things that it's easy to catch them out being hypocritical.

50
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,360
And then we, the public, get morally indignant about it.

51
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes, to catch somebody out means to discover they have made a mistake.

52
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,319
And morally indignant means being angry about something,

53
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,719
according to the principles of right and wrong.

54
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,240
Let's listen to Professor Martin again talking about the difficulties of being a politician.

55
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:58,400
I think in our contemporary democracy it's become obvious to most of us that the views that we

56
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,280
expect from our politicians and the kinds of views that get our politicians elected

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,759
are maybe completely incongruous with the way they lead their personal lives and what they

58
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:17,680
personally believe. And this is how it can become very morally pernicious, very morally dangerous.

59
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:26,399
Okay, so we elect politicians based on their views. For example, on the environment, on education,

60
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:33,759
foreign policy, but their public views may be incongruous or not in agreement with their personal

61
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,399
views. And the difference between their public and personal views can be pernicious.

62
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,239
It means deadly or destructive.

63
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:46,560
Hmm, politicians are under scrutiny all the time. Their personal lives, their public statements.

64
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,560
Now with social media, a thoughtless comment goes viral or spreads very quickly via the internet.

65
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,040
That's true. And actually, I posted a photo of my red pickup truck earlier.

66
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,879
Oh, has it gone viral, Rob?

67
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,439
No, but there is a negative comment from the local conservationists.

68
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:08,879
Oh dear. Well, Rob, I think it's time I told you the answer to today's quiz question.

69
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:16,720
I asked, what did the ancient Greek word hypocrite originally describe? Was it a actor,

70
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,400
be politician or see horse? And I said be politician.

71
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:29,680
And you were wrong, I'm afraid. Hypocrites was a technical term for a stage actor and was not

72
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,680
considered an appropriate role for a public figure. In Athens, in the fourth century BC,

73
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,160
the great Orator de Mocenese ridiculed a rival politician who had been a successful actor.

74
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,880
Well, we're running out of time, so can we hear the words we learned today?

75
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:58,800
They are hypocrite, inconsistent, harsh, compassionate, catch somebody out, morally indignant,

76
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,720
incongruous, pernicious, go viral.

77
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,200
Well, that's the end of today's six minute English. Don't forget to join us again soon.

78
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,840
Bye-bye.

79
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,320
Bye-bye.

80
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
Let's go to English from the BBC.
