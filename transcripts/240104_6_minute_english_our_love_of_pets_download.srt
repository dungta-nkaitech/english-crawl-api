00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
6 Minute English from the BBC.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,320
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,600
And I'm Georgie. It's said that your personality is reflected in your pet,

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,120
an animal that you keep in your home as a companion and treat kindly.

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,640
Dog people are supposed to be friendly, enthusiastic and loyal,

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,960
whereas cat people are introverted, proud and sensitive.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,600
Are you a dog person or a cat person, Neil?

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,560
Oh, I'm definitely a dog person, Georgie.

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:42,400
I want a pet that's friendly and loves me, not a lazy cat that sits around all day waiting for food.

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,320
Whether you're a dog person, a cat person, or have a goldfish, hamster or parrot for a pet,

11
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,920
the British are well known as a nation of animal lovers.

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,320
In the UK, 52% of owners describe their pet as their best friend,

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,160
and in 2021, 18 million homes had at least one pet,

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,079
meaning that for the first time, there were more households with a pet than without.

15
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:12,599
In this programme, we'll be hearing how our relationship with pets has changed over the centuries,

16
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:17,359
and, as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

17
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,960
But first, I have a question for you, Georgie.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,919
Nowadays, thanks to the internet, modern pets are getting online.

19
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:32,199
So, what percent of dogs and cats in the UK do you think have their own social media profile?

20
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:38,599
Is it A, 7%, B, 17%, or C, 70%.

21
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:45,000
It sounds crazy, but I'll guess 17% of British pets have their own social media account.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,919
OK, Georgie, we'll find out the answer later in the programme.

23
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,200
Cats using Instagram and dogs on TikTok may be a strange new development,

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,480
but our relationship with pets has continually changed throughout history.

25
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,079
In the 1800s, people started using the word pet

26
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:06,960
to describe the emotional connection they felt to a special animal,

27
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,520
and gradually it became normal to keep pets indoors.

28
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,599
Here, Jane Hamlet, Professor of History and author of a new book, The Pet Revolution,

29
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:20,359
explains to BBC Radio 4 programme, thinking aloud,

30
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:24,840
how early British attitudes to pets were based on economics.

31
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:31,479
First of all, on a very practical level, living standards are gradually increasing across that period,

32
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:36,919
and it becomes more possible to keep pets if you have more disposable income.

33
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:40,919
But I think in British culture, in the 19th century, in particular,

34
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:47,719
human family are increasingly celebrated, and keeping a pet becomes a way of bringing animals

35
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:52,759
into your home life, and also really expressing what it means to be part of a family.

36
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,759
Animals become part of that.

37
00:02:55,799 --> 00:03:00,919
Family pets became more popular as people's living standards increased.

38
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:05,239
Living standards, which are also known as the standard of living,

39
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:09,399
refer to the level of material comfort people live in.

40
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,200
It's connected to their disposable income,

41
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:18,200
the money left over to spend on things you want after paying tax and other living expenses.

42
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:24,680
In other words, as people got richer, they had more money to spend on luxury items, including pets.

43
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,599
And by the Victorian era, this included new and exotic pets,

44
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:32,520
such as tigers, lions, monkeys, and elephants,

45
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,879
which were shipped back from around the British Empire.

46
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,359
Even the famous Victorian writer, Charles Dickens, owned a pet raven.

47
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:45,479
It was also the Victorians who first described Britain as a nation of dog lovers,

48
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,639
a phrase they used to reflect the idea they had of themselves,

49
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:54,359
as Professor Jane Hamlet explained to BBC Radio 4 programme, thinking aloud.

50
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:58,759
In the Victorian era, dogs were very much the top pet,

51
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:03,479
and you can see that the values that were often associated with dogs,

52
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:09,560
so loyalty, trustfulness, steadfastness, all of these qualities were also celebrated by the

53
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,719
Victorians as key parts of the Victorian manly character. So dogs really fitted the bill.

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,519
The Victorians admired the qualities associated with dogs,

55
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,599
qualities like self-confidence and loyalty, being strong and unchanging in support of your friends.

56
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,439
While dogs were considered strong and manly, cats were feminine and weak.

57
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,199
So for the Victorians, dogs really fitted the bill,

58
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:39,959
an idiom meaning they were suitable for a particular purpose.

59
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:43,959
Britain's relationship with pets really has changed over the years.

60
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:49,399
From the manly British Bulldog to funny cat videos on YouTube, it's been quite a journey.

61
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:53,480
Maybe it's time to reveal the answer to my question, Georgie.

62
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:59,639
Right. You asked me how many dogs and cats in the UK had their own social media profile,

63
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:02,040
and I guessed it was 17%.

64
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:09,240
Which was the correct answer? What I still don't understand is how they get their paws on the

65
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,760
keypad. Anyway, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this program about the love the

66
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:20,439
British have for their pets, animals you keep in your home as a companion and treat kindly.

67
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:26,280
A cat person is someone who likes or prefers cats, unlike a dog person who prefers dogs.

68
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:33,319
Living standards or standard of living refers to the level of material comfort in which people live.

69
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:39,319
Your disposable income is the money left over to spend on things you want after paying taxes

70
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:45,479
and your living expenses. Loyalty means having strong and unchanging support for your friends.

71
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:50,679
And finally, if something fits the bill, it's suitable to serve a particular purpose.
