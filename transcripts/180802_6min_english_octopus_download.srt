6 Minute English from the BBC.

4
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:14,320
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,919
Hello and I'm Catherine.

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,719
Now, Catherine, how do you feel about cephalopods?

7
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:22,640
Cephalopods.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,440
Yeah, you do know what cephalopods are, don't you?

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,560
Yes, of course I do. It's a new kind of iPod, isn't it?

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,039
Not exactly, no.

11
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,799
A cephalopod is a kind of sea creature, like a squid or octopus.

12
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:36,159
Oh!

13
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,519
Cephalopods, yes of course I know what a cephalopod is.

14
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,519
Of course you do.

15
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:44,959
Well, today's programme is all about one of these squishy creatures,

16
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:48,799
the octopus, which apparently is a pretty clever animal.

17
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,439
To start, here's today's quiz question.

18
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,840
What is the correct plural form of octopus?

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,320
Is it A, octopuses, B, octopodes,

20
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,039
or C, octopi? What do you think, Catherine?

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,840
Okay, I think this is a trick question.

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,719
I think people think that it's octopi,

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,359
but it's actually there's a technical term for it, which is the correct term,

24
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,200
and that's octopodes.

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,120
But some people think like children and stuff,

26
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,560
they just put the plural S on, so they say octopuses.

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,359
So I'm going for answer B, octopodes.

28
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,200
Well, listen out for the answer at the end of the programme,

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,680
just to see how right or wrong you are.

30
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,080
Now, apparently, the octopus is a remarkably intelligent creature.

31
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,640
They have the ability to solve some complex problems,

32
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,600
and in one famous case, one was even able to predict the results of World Cup football matches.

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,640
Oh, yes, Paul the psychic octopus.

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,040
I don't think he was really psychic, though.

35
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,840
It was just a publicity stunt by the zoo that had him as a way to promote their zoo.

36
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,680
It may have been a publicity stunt, but he was actually quite accurate.

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,840
In fact, he correctly predicted the result of 12 matches at a 14.

38
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,600
That's 86 percent, not bad, hey.

39
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,480
That's amazing. I didn't know he was that good.

40
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,080
Anyway, Neil, tell us some more about the octopus.

41
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,040
Well, I'll leave that to Peter Godfrey Smith,

42
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,560
philosopher of science and author of other minds,

43
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,400
the octopus, the sea, and the deep origins of consciousness.

44
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,680
He is quite a fan of our eight tentacle friends.

45
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,560
On the BBC Radio 4 programmes start the week,

46
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,159
he said that humans and the octopus have a common ancestor.

47
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:31,199
This is a term in science, which means a creature from which both species evolved,

48
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,120
like a very distant relative.

49
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,479
How long ago does he say this common ancestor lived?

50
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:43,120
We got the octopus as a very special evolutionary product.

51
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,640
It's an animal that's removed from us by a lot of evolutionary distance.

52
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,679
The common ancestor that we share with an octopus lived about 600 million years ago,

53
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:55,279
or actually even a bit longer than that,

54
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,959
but it has a large nervous system in a range comparable to vertebrates.

55
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:07,919
So, our common ancestor lived about 600 million years ago,

56
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,079
or maybe a little bit longer than that.

57
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:14,879
And he says that the octopus has a nervous system that is comparable to vertebrates.

58
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,359
Comparable means similar to like,

59
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,240
and vertebrates is the term for the group of animals that have a spinal backbone.

60
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,640
We humans are examples of vertebrates.

61
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,320
So, what Godfrey Smith is saying is that the squishy octopus has a nervous system,

62
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,440
which has some similarities to our own, in that it's quite large.

63
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,000
And a large nervous system is a sign of intelligence.

64
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,040
He goes on to talk a bit more about how we might be able to relate to the octopus.

65
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,080
He talks about the protean nature of its body.

66
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,600
Protean is an adjective which means adaptable or changeable,

67
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,920
and the octopus's body is certainly that.

68
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,640
Why might that be a problem for us?

69
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,200
The sensory world of an octopus has, in some ways it's recognisable.

70
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,920
They're very visual animals, they're very taste-oriented animals, and those things make sense to us.

71
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,560
But the absence of hard parts, the protean nature of the body, and the sort of extent of

72
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,920
the sensitivity makes it hard thing to think about.

73
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,199
This is interesting, isn't it?

74
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,759
So, the octopus uses its senses of vision and taste, like we do, and this is something we can

75
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:35,199
recognise. But what's tricky for us is that its form is so completely different from ours.

76
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,120
The octopus isn't a vertebrate, so it can change its form and its shape very easily.

77
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,000
Yes, we're not used to thinking of soft squishy things having intelligence.

78
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,959
And speaking of intelligence, we've been very careful not to use the plural of octopus,

79
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,399
so as not to give away the answer to today's quiz question, which was,

80
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,800
what is the correct plural form?

81
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:02,959
A, octopuses, B, octopodes, or C, octopi? Catherine, you said.

82
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:09,600
Well, I said that some people think it's octopuses. A lot of people think it's octopi,

83
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,240
but the actual answer is octopodes.

84
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,600
And you are completely right, congratulations.

85
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,120
Yeah, thank you. So, let's review today's vocabulary.

86
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,080
Cephalopod is the name of the group of animals to which the octopus belongs.

87
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:30,240
A publicity stunt is something a company might do to grab your attention and promote its products,

88
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,160
like claiming an octopus can predict the winner of football matches.

89
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,320
A common ancestor is a distant relative from which two different species evolved.

90
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,560
Comparable to means similar to and vertebrates are animals that have a spine.

91
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,440
And then finally we had protean. This adjective means adaptable and changeable.

92
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,680
