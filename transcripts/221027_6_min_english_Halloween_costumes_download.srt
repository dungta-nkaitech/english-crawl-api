Hello, this is 6 minutes English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

3
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,640
And I'm Neil.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,280
Woo! Trick or treat.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,240
For listeners at home, Neil is dressed up as a ghost. He's wearing a white bedsheet over his head

6
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,839
with two holes, cussed out for his eyes, which must mean...

7
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:37,839
It's Halloween! The start of autumn, when the days get shorter and leaves fall from the trees,

8
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:43,599
marks Halloween, a festival which is celebrated all over the world at this time of year.

9
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:49,039
In Britain, people carve scary faces into pumpkins and children go trick or treating,

10
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,759
dressing up in fancy dress costumes and visiting people's homes, shouting,

11
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:59,359
trick or treat for sweets and candy. Halloween comes from an ancient festival called

12
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,439
Sauwen, which celebrated the changing of the seasons, a time when it was believed the dead

13
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,840
could make contact with the living, which is why children dress up as ghosts,

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,120
which is an other scary monsters. But recently, online shops have removed

15
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,680
several Halloween costumes, including creepy clown masks and real-life serial killer costumes.

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,800
After parents complained, they were too frightening. In this programme, we'll be discussing whether

17
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Halloween is no longer harmless fun, and as usual, we'll be learning some new vocabulary as well.

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,600
But before that, and since you're all dressed up as a ghost, Neil, my question is this,

19
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,560
why did people traditionally dress up in costumes on Halloween? Was it A, to scare their

20
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,640
neighbours as a joke? B, to use up their old clothes or C to hide from ghosts?

21
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,520
Hmm, I think it was to hide from ghosts.

22
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,799
Okay, Neil, we'll find out the answer later in the programme. In recent years, Halloween has become

23
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,120
more influenced by American horror movies like Friday the 13th or Scream. Some parents now think

24
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:11,920
Halloween costumes are too scary and over the top, a phrase meaning too extreme and unsuitable.

25
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:17,199
Mother of two, Joanna Connell, was shocked when she took her 10-year-old dorsus shopping for

26
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:23,279
Halloween costumes. Here she explains what she saw to BBC Radio 4 programme, You and Yours.

27
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:29,679
They've seen decorations of small children holding a teddy bear covered in blood. They've seen

28
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:36,879
what's described as a standing animated decoration, which looks like a dead girl carrying a knife.

29
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:44,960
And various grim reapers, creepy clowns and stuff that kids are now finding, frightening and even

30
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,719
to turn a head off they look pretty vial actually. And I think it feels like retailers, it's a some kind

31
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:58,000
of race to the bottom for the grimest most vial sickening outfit so that they can just make money out of.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,159
Joanna was horrified by Halloween costumes of the grim reaper, an imaginary skeleton who wears a

33
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,800
long black cloak, carries a sharp cutting tool and represents death. She's worried that costumes

34
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,079
like this are too frightening for little children. Nowadays, Halloween is big business and Joanna

35
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:22,159
thinks that the focus on money encourages shops in a race to the bottom, a phrase which describes a

36
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,840
situation where companies compete with each other to sell as many products as cheaply as possible.

37
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,079
The phrase is connected to the idea of standards getting worse and worse.

38
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,920
But come on, Sam. Isn't this going too far? I mean, Halloween is supposed to be scary.

39
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,240
Yeah, parents don't want to stop people having fun, but over the top costumes are too scary for younger

40
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,520
children. And some mums say they will no longer open the door to trick or treat us because the

41
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,920
costumes are giving children nightmares. Shavorn Freigard, founder of the Parenting website channel Mum,

42
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,600
thinks a compromise is needed. Here she is, talking to BBC Radio 4's, you and yours.

43
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,039
There's a sort of a halfway house, isn't there? I mean, I know everyone refers to the new

44
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,879
generation. There's a snowflake generation and we shouldn't be so worried about our little

45
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,879
darlings, but there's a point beyond which it becomes tasteful or appropriate.

46
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:22,639
Shavorn thinks that scary costumes are okay for teenagers, but she also wants to protect younger

47
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,879
children. She thinks we need to find a halfway house, a compromise or arrangement which includes

48
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:35,279
features of two opposing ideas. She also uses the expression, the snowflake generation, a phrase

49
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:41,040
which is sometimes used to describe the generation of young people who became adults in or after

50
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,600
the 2010s and who are considered by some to be easily upset and offended. Now I can see how some

51
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,680
costumes are over the top and I don't want to spoil Halloween for anyone, so I'll stick with my

52
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,400
bed sheet ghost. Anyway, isn't it time for you to reveal the answer to your question, Sam?

53
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,840
Yes, I asked why people started dressing up at Halloween in the first place and you said it was

54
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,319
to hide from ghosts, which was the correct answer. Hundreds of years ago, people thought that ghosts

55
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,840
would try to return to their old homes at Halloween. People wore masks so that the ghosts would

56
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,600
mistake them for other spirits. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned starting with

57
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,040
trick-or-treating, the Halloween tradition of dressing up in creepy costumes and knocking on

58
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,560
neighbor's doors, shouting, trick-or-treat for sweets and candy. Over the top, describe something

59
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,680
which is too extreme, unsuitable or unacceptable. The grim reaper is an imagined representation of

60
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,600
debt and looks like a skeleton in a long black cloak. A race to the bottom happens when companies

61
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,960
compete with each other in order to sell as many products as cheaply as possible. A halfway

62
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:57,680
house is a compromise which includes features of two contrasting ideas. And finally, the Snowflake

63
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,799
generation is used by some people to refer to the present generation of young people who they

64
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:10,399
think lack resilience and are easily upset. Enjoy Halloween and don't get too scared. Bye for now. Bye.
