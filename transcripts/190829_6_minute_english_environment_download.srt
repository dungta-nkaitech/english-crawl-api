Hello, this is 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,919
And I'm Sam.

5
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,440
Now, tell me about your teeth cleaning routine.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,640
Huh, okay, well it's pretty good.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,600
I think I brush twice a day and change my brush every couple of months.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,560
And what kind of brush do you use?

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,760
Nothing fancy, just a regular cheap plastic one.

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,960
Oh dear.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,320
Hmm, what do you mean?

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,160
Well, imagine all the toothbrushes you've used in your life

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,079
from your first brush as a child to the one you currently have.

14
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,680
You do realise that probably they all still exist in the environment somewhere.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,280
We use them for a couple of months,

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,480
yet they were lost for hundreds of years.

17
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh dear, and I thought I was actually quite environmentally aware.

18
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,319
But that's quite shocking.

19
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:01,759
I hadn't thought of that.

20
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,079
Well, it's just one of the problems we're facing with our use of plastics.

21
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,719
A marvellous invention that has given us so much,

22
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:15,199
but we are beginning to realise it's causing many long-lasting environmental problems.

23
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:17,920
More on this topic shortly, but first a question.

24
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,239
Plastic has many natural variations,

25
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,199
but where was the first artificial plastic developed?

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,120
Was it A, England, B, Germany, or C, Switzerland?

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,640
What do you think Sam?

28
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,359
I'm going to have a guess at Switzerland.

29
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,480
Okay, we'll find out if you're right at the end of the programme.

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,240
Environmental issues are of course a big story at the moment.

31
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,879
The topic was featured on the BBC Woman's Hour Radio programme recently.

32
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:48,240
Madeleine Murray is from an Irish organisation that gives advice to businesses and communities

33
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,840
on how to operate in an environmentally responsible way.

34
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,960
She was asked about what she does in her daily life

35
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,040
that other people could do too.

36
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,280
What food items does she mention?

37
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,040
My personal, like, pet peeve is multipax and mini-pax.

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,640
I buy them bulk now. I buy the biggest yogurt I can buy.

39
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,719
I buy big cereal boxes.

40
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,560
I buy big shampoo bottles.

41
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,640
We can decant stuff into lunch boxes and we can, you know, refill our pasta and our rice.

42
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,159
So what food does she mention, Sam?

43
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,919
She talks about yogurt, cereal, pasta and rice.

44
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,719
And what was she saying about those foods?

45
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,439
She was saying that she buys the biggest containers for those that she can.

46
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,079
And not just food, things like shampoo as well.

47
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,759
And what's the benefit of that?

48
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:42,159
Well, she says that her pet peeve is small packs of things.

49
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,000
A pet peeve is something that you find particularly annoying.

50
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,520
She doesn't like small packs because they use a lot of packaging for a small amount of product.

51
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,439
So she buys in bulk.

52
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,240
Buying in bulk means buying a lot of something.

53
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,360
And if you have a lot of something like rice or pasta,

54
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,759
you can always transfer it to different smaller reusable containers.

55
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,840
She uses the word decant for this.

56
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,560
So that's one area where we can all be a bit more environmentally friendly.

57
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,240
Another area is reusing things that are perfectly good,

58
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,159
but which we don't need anymore.

59
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,280
Dr Tara Shine is a colleague of Madeline Murray,

60
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,920
and she talked about how new parents often buy a lot of new things for their babies,

61
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,520
which they then throw away when the child gets too big or too old.

62
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,879
She suggests that it's better to pass these things on to give them to other people.

63
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
Then pass things on.

64
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,000
The hand me down passing on culture is really, really important in the world of kids.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,080
And there are lots of things that can be passed down, whether it's toys or

66
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,560
the equipment or the high chair, whatever it is, all of that can be passed on.

67
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,680
And that's really important.

68
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,360
It's saving someone else money.

69
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,000
Most of these things are in good nick when we need to pass them on.

70
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,560
She used another expression for passing things on, didn't she?

71
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,600
Yes, she talked about the hand me down culture.

72
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,360
When I was growing up, I had a lot of hand me downs.

73
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,320
These were toys and clothes from my older cousins,

74
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,040
which saved us a lot of money, and they were then passed on to someone else.

75
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,199
And the thing is children grow up quickly, so often everything is in good condition.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,199
Dr. Schein used an interesting expression for that, didn't she?

77
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,279
She said most of these things are in good nick.

78
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,599
That expression means in good condition.

79
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:30,639
Now, before we recycle today's vocabulary...

80
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,159
Ah, very good.

81
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,279
See what you did there.

82
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,680
It's time for the answer to today's question.

83
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,199
Where was the first artificial plastic developed?

84
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,519
Was it A, England, B, Germany, or C, Switzerland?

85
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,519
What did you think, Sam?

86
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,719
I guess Switzerland.

87
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,319
Well, I'm afraid you are wrong.

88
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,480
The correct answer is actually England.

89
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,800
Well done if you got that right.

90
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,639
Extra bonus points if you knew that in 1856, Alexander Parks,

91
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,959
patented, Parkinson, the first artificial plastic.

92
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,839
Now, let's recap today's words and expressions.

93
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,319
Yes, a pet peeve is something that someone finds particularly annoying.

94
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,159
Buying in bulk means buying many of the same things

95
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,000
or a large quantity of something.

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,399
Buying in bulk is usually cheaper and can be better environmentally.

97
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:27,199
And if you have a lot of something, you can decant it to smaller containers.

98
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,639
That is, you can transfer it to those other containers to make it easier to use.

99
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,319
For example, I buy huge bottles of liquid soap

100
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,399
and decant it into smaller dispenses for the kitchen and bathrooms.

101
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,959
You can pass on clothes, toys, and other kids stuff to family and friends.

102
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,920
This means giving them to other people to use.

103
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,800
And those things can be described as hand-me-downs.

104
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,800
But, of course, you'd only want to pass on things in good nick.

105
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,560
That is, in good condition.

106
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,159
Right, that's all we have time for.

107
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,639
We hope you will join us again soon, though.

108
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,680
And you can always find us on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, online, and on our app.

109
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,280
We are BBC Learning English.

110
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,000
See you soon.

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,720
Goodbye.

112
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,439
Bye.
