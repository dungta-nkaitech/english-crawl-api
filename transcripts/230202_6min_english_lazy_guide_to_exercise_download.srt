3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And I'm Sam. Did you make any new years resolutions this year, Neil?

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
They're promises that you make to yourself to do something positive in the coming year.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And now that we're in February, it's getting harder to keep those promises.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yes, the same promises I make every year, Sam, to exercise more and get fit.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But I'm too lazy to go running on cold winter mornings. I'd rather stay in bed.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Are you feeling out of shape after Christmas, like Neil? Maybe you want to be more active,

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
but can't find the time. If so, this programme is for you.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes, in this lazy person's guide to exercise, we'll be asking, what is the least amount of exercise someone can get away with doing while still staying healthy?

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And of course, we'll be learning some useful vocabulary as well.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Of course, any exercise is better than none. Structured exercise, activities like going to a fitness class or swimming are great.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But if that's not possible, we'll be hearing about small changes you can make that will help as well.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Which is good news because fewer and fewer of us are doing what the UK government recommends.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:39,000
30 minutes of moderate exercise a day. In fact, the government recently downgraded its recommendations because so few brits were following it.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So, Sam, according to new government advice, what is the minimum number of steps we should walk every day to stay healthy?

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Is it A, 5,000 steps, B, 10,000 steps or C, 20,000 steps?

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll say A, 5,000 steps per day.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay, Sam, we'll find out the answer at the end of the programme.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Someone else who's interested in how little exercise he can do is BBC reporter James Gallagher.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Here's James speaking with sports physiologist Dr Zoe Sainer. After Zoe had been monitoring James's fitness while running on a treadmill for BBC Radio 4 programme Inside Science.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But I also know you do regularly try and do structured exercise.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So, just so we can make structured exercise training is going for a swim once a week.

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Generally, that's fantastic. I guess my question to you would be how hard do you push yourself when you go swimming?

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Not as hard as the treadmill.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Well, I think the big thing if we come back to this question of what is the least I can do.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There's clear evidence that if you want to do shorter exercise sessions, they need to be of a higher intensity, right?

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It said there's a trade-off.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Zoe says that if you don't have much time to exercise, it's okay to do shorter sessions as long as you push yourself.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Try harder and put more effort into what you're doing.

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If you can swim a length in 40 seconds, push yourself to swim it in 35.

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That means exercising harder, of course, but for a shorter time. In other words, there's a trade-off.

34
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You accept the disadvantages of something in order to get the benefit it brings.

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Another problem for many people is that their job is sedentary. It involves little exercise or physical activity.

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Zoe thinks it's important that office workers who sit down all day also find time to exercise.

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Here she shares her tips with BBC Radio 4 programme inside health.

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Especially people who have office jobs are sat down all day. We then look at some of the easy wins.

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So active travel. And even if that's parking a little bit further away, one of the exciting areas in the literature that's coming out at the moment is actually walking faster.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So if you have no time to suddenly do 10,000 steps a day, can we get you to do 5,000 steps faster?

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Will we see an improvement on your health? Yes, we will see an improvement on your health, especially over a longer period of time.

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The big focus around short, sharp exercise sessions is you get more bang for your buck.

43
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Zoe suggestions for active travel, things like walking from the car and using the stairs instead of the lift are easy wins, tasks that are both easy to accomplish and bring benefits.

44
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Easy wins like short but intensive bursts of exercise. Increase fitness and give you more bang for your buck.

45
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
An idiom which means that you get better results for the same amount of effort you put in.

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's something everyone can appreciate, even you, Neil.

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Well, I'll definitely try to walk more, but remember Sam the body needs rest too.

48
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And speaking of walking, isn't it time to reveal the answer to your question? How many steps does the UK government recommend we should walk a day?

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I guess it was 5,000, so was I right?

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You were close, Sam, but in fact the correct answer is 10,000 steps a day.

51
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Although as Zoe mentioned, walking fewer steps faster has benefits too.

52
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from our lazy guide to exercise, starting with New Year's resolution.

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
A promise you make to yourself to do positive things in the coming year.

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
When you push yourself, you put more effort into what you're doing.

55
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
In a trade-off, you accept the disadvantages of something in order to get the benefits as well.

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Trade-off can also be used as a verb.

57
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The adjective said in tree describes something which involves little exercise or physical activity.

58
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
An easy win is a task that is both easy to accomplish and brings positive results.

59
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And finally, the idiom more bang for your buck means you get a better outcome for the same amount of effort you put into something.

60
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We hope your New Year's resolutions have made it into February.

61
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If there's just one you keep, make it joining us again soon for more topical chat.

62
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Here at 6 Minute English. Bye for now.
