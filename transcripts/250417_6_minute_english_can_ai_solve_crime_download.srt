00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:13,599
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Beth.

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,879
And I'm Neil. Don't forget that you can find a transcript and a quiz for this episode on our website

4
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:25,679
BBCLearningEnglish.com. Now, today Neil, we're talking all about solving crime.

5
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,920
Do you think you'd be a good detective?

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,520
Actually, no, Beth, I think. My brain's not very good with details.

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,439
Today we'll be talking about how artificial intelligence might help detectives and the police

8
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:45,840
investigate crimes. But first, I have a question for you, Beth. In the UK, lots of people enjoy

9
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,000
watching fictional detectives on TV. These programs are called murder mysteries and tell the story

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,799
of a detective solving a crime. In 2020, a magazine called The Radio Times asked readers

11
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:05,920
who their favourite TV detective was. So, who do you think was the most popular? Was it A, Sherlock

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,840
Holmes, B, Aircule Poirot or C, Miss Marple? Surely it's Sherlock Holmes. Well, you sound

13
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,319
very sure, but I will reveal the answer at the end of the program. Now, when the police are investigating

14
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:26,079
crimes in the real world, their techniques are often quite different from what we see on television.

15
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:32,239
Yes, solving crimes involves collecting and reviewing lots of evidence, like DNA,

16
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:40,799
fingerprints or CCTV. All of this work takes a lot of time, so can AI help police speed up the work

17
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,639
and even solve crimes? That's the question listener Alistair had for the BBC Radio 4 program,

18
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,760
The Artificial Human, and host Alex Krotowski wanted to know more.

19
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,960
So, Alistair, why are you asking this question? Tell us a little bit about yourself and where

20
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,960
you're coming from. So, my name is Alistair and I'm a serving police officer. My background is

21
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,639
with investigation. I'm looking at artificial intelligence and thinking, what can it do for me?

22
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:16,240
Alex asks Alistair to explain where he's coming from. This means explain his perspective or point

23
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,400
of view. In informal English, we'll often ask someone, do you get where I'm coming from?

24
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,080
And we're asking whether they understand our opinion or perspective.

25
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,159
Alistair explains that he's interested in how artificial intelligence could help solve crimes,

26
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,439
because he's a police officer with a background in investigations. If you have a background in

27
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:43,280
something, it means most of your previous work or experience was related to something. For example,

28
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,520
I work as a producer at BBC Learning English Now Making Programs, but my background is in

29
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:56,479
classroom teaching. Alistair talks about using artificial intelligence for training and asks,

30
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:02,719
what can it do for me? This means how can artificial intelligence help or improve something?

31
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:08,080
When a crime happens, police officers have to collect and review a lot of information to find

32
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,280
evidence. When you have a lot of information to review, it can be difficult to know what's

33
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,680
important and find patterns which might be relevant to the crime. But Professor Roof Morgan,

34
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,320
an expert in crime and forensic science, thinks AI could help speed up police work,

35
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:32,800
as she told BBC Radio 4's The Artificial Human. I think we're seeing a renaissance in the pattern

36
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,600
recognition forms of evidence, so finger marks, footwear marks. There's been lots of challenges with

37
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,759
those forms of evidence over the last 10 years, probably go a little bit out of favour. And yet,

38
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,159
what we're beginning to see now with AI is that you can take a photo of a mark with your phone,

39
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,240
compare that mark to the database and get real time insight.

40
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:56,319
Roof says there's a renaissance in looking at patterns in evidence, such as finger marks or

41
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:02,719
footwear marks. Renaissance means new interest or activity in a particular topic or area.

42
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:08,240
This kind of evidence went a little bit out of favour over recent years because of the

43
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:15,039
excitement around DNA evidence. If something is out of favour, it's less popular or appealing.

44
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:21,759
But AI could mean that patterns in finger marks or footwear marks are useful in solving crimes again.

45
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,000
This is because AI can be used to compare a picture of a mark with a database of pictures from

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,720
other crimes and get real time insight. The adjective real time means the information is presented

47
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,839
at the same time that it's happening. Yes, AI can compare lots of information very quickly,

48
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:47,279
which makes finding patterns in evidence much easier and more reliable.

49
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:52,480
There are some problems with using AI to solve crimes, though. To find these patterns,

50
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,759
lots of private information would need to be collected. And police usually have to give

51
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,120
clear reasons why they need access to certain information in their investigations.

52
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,720
It's unlikely an AI-powered robot would ever replace a detective anytime soon.

53
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,520
Yes, and that reminds me of your question, Neil. I said that Sherlock Holmes was maybe the most

54
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,920
popular detective. Was I right? You were absolutely right. And I think people should try the quiz

55
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,280
on our website to find out how much they know as well. It's at BBCLearningEnglish.com.

56
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,720
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned starting with the expression where you're coming from,

57
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,000
which means you're opinion or perspective on something. Your background is the area that you have

58
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,400
the most work experience in. The question, what can this do for me? Means how can this help or

59
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,400
improve things? Renaissance means new interest or activity in something. If something is out of

60
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:56,560
favour, it has become less popular or appealing. And the adjective real-time means information is

61
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,079
presented as it is happening. Once again, our six minutes are up. Head to our website to find more
