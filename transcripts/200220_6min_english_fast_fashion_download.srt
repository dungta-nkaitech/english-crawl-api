00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,559
Hello, this is 6M8English from BBC Learning English. I'm Georgina.

6
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:17,359
And I'm Neil.

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,839
In this programme we're talking about buying clothes

8
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,280
and only wearing them a few times before buying more clothes.

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,199
This is something known as fast fashion.

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,679
It's popular. It might make us feel good,

11
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,679
but it's not great for the environment.

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,560
Which is why lots of people this year are pledging

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,159
or promising publicly to buy no new clothes.

14
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:39,679
I for one, I'm wearing the same shirt, I bought seven years ago.

15
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,480
You're certainly not a fashion victim, Neil.

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,480
But first, let's test your knowledge of fast fashion with a question.

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,159
Do you know how many items of clothing were sent to landfill

18
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:52,799
in the UK in 2017?

19
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,840
Was it A, 23 million items,

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,200
B, 234 million items,

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,400
or C, 2.3 billion items?

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,440
What do you think, Neil?

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,920
I'm sure it's lots, but not billions.

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,640
So I'm going to say 23 million items.

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,439
I shall tell you if you're right at the end of the programme.

26
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,840
Let's talk more about fast fashion,

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,359
which is being blamed for contributing to global warming.

28
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,560
And discarded clothes, that means ones that are thrown away,

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,800
are also piling up in landfill sites

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,520
and fiber fragments are flowing into the sea

31
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:26,959
when clothes are washed.

32
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:32,079
It's not great, and I've heard the average time someone wears something is just seven.

33
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,119
So why is this?

34
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,560
And what is driving our desire to keep buying more clothes?

35
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,759
I think we should hear it from fashion journalist Lauren Bravo,

36
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,759
who's been speaking on the BBC Radio 4 programme You and Yours.

37
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,159
She explained that clothes today are relatively cheaper than those from her parents days.

38
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:51,439
A lot of clothing production got outsourced

39
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,439
off-shored over to the developing world.

40
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,519
So countries like Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, China,

41
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,599
and our responsible for making the vast bulk of all the clothes that are sold in the UK.

42
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,439
And with that we've seen what we call chasing the cheapest needle around the world.

43
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,400
So the fashion industry constantly looking to undercut competitors

44
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,120
and with that clothes getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper.

45
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,400
Right, so clothes in the developed world at least have become cheaper

46
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,360
because they are produced in developing countries.

47
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,920
These are countries which are trying to become more advanced economically and socially.

48
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,240
So production is outsourced, that means work usually done in one company

49
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,160
is given to another company to do.

50
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,040
Often because that company has the skills to do it.

51
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,800
And in the case of fashion production, it can be done cheaper by another company based in a developing country.

52
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,040
Lauren used an interesting expression chasing the cheapest needle.

53
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,040
So the fashion industry is always looking to find the company which can make clothes cheaper.

54
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,919
A company that can undercut another one means they can do the same job cheaper.

55
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,879
Therefore the price of clothes gets cheaper for us.

56
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,399
Okay, so it might be good to be able to buy cheaper clothes.

57
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:04,799
But why do we have to buy more and only wear items a few times?

58
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:07,359
It's all about our obsession with shopping and fashion.

59
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:12,079
It's something Lauren Bravo goes on to explain on the UNIORS radio program.

60
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:14,879
See if you can hear what she blames for this obsession.

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,240
Buying new things has almost become a trend in itself for certain generations.

62
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,359
I think that feeling that you can't be seen in the same thing twice.

63
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:25,759
It really stems from social media particularly.

64
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,719
And quite often people are buying those outfits to take a photo to put on Instagram.

65
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:33,519
It sounds illogical but I think when all of your friends are doing it,

66
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,280
there is this invisible pressure there.

67
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:38,079
Lauren makes some interesting points.

68
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:42,240
Firstly, for some generations there is just a trend for buying things.

69
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,120
It does seem very wasteful but as Lauren says,

70
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,560
some people don't like to be seen wearing the same thing twice.

71
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,200
And this idea is caused by social media.

72
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,760
She uses the expression stems from.

73
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,800
She describes the social pressure of needing to be seen wearing new clothes on Instagram.

74
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:06,400
And the availability of cheap clothes means it's possible to post new images of yourself wearing new clothes very regularly.

75
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,439
Hmm, it sounds very wasteful and to me illogical,

76
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,719
not reasonable or sensible and more driven by emotions rather than any practical reason.

77
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,120
But there is a bit of a backlash now.

78
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,399
That's a strong negative reaction toward what is happening.

79
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,639
Some people are now promising to buy second-hand clothes or vintage clothes

80
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,319
or make do with the clothes they have and men the ones they need.

81
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:30,800
It could be the start of a new fashion trend.

82
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,199
Yes and for once I will be on trend and it could reduce the amount of clothes sent to landfill that you mentioned earlier.

83
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,479
Yes, I asked you if you knew how many items are clothing

84
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,079
were sent to landfill in the UK in 2017.

85
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:53,759
Was it A, 23 million items, B, 234 million items or C, 2.3 billion items?

86
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,039
What did you say Neil?

87
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:57,759
I said A, 23 million items.

88
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,199
And you're wrong.

89
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,039
It's actually 234 million items.

90
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,399
That's according to the Envaro Audit Committee.

91
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,639
It also found that 1.2 billion tonnes of carbon emissions

92
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,199
is released by the global fashion industry.

93
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,679
Well, we're clearly throwing away too many clothes but perhaps we can recycle some of the vocabulary we've mentioned today.

94
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:22,959
I think we can. Starting with pledging.

95
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,599
That means publicly promising to do something.

96
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:27,759
You can make a pledge to do something.

97
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,439
When something is outsourced, it's given to another company to do.

98
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,599
Often because that company has the skills to do it or it can be done cheaper.

99
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,439
And if one company undercuts another, it charges less to do that job than its competitor.

100
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:46,000
The expression stems from means is caused by or a result of

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,200
we mentioned that the rise in fast fashion stems from sharing images on Instagram.

102
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,000
And we mentioned this being illogical.

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,240
So it seems unreasonable, not sensible and more driven by emotions

104
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,560
rather than any practical reason.

105
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,560
And a backlash is a strong negative reaction to what is happening.

106
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,160
And that brings us to the end of our discussion about fast fashion.

107
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,240
Please join us again next time. Bye.

108
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,439
Bye.
