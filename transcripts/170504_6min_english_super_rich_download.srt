00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,160
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English,

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,559
the program where we bring you an interesting topic

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,120
and six items of vocabulary. I'm Neil.

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,400
And I'm Catherine.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,920
Today we're taking a look into the lives of the super rich

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,960
and we're going to look at one of their favourite pastimes.

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,839
The super rich are people with over 30 million US dollars of assets.

12
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,359
Oh, now assets are things that we can own and sell,

13
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,399
like property, boats and private planes.

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,000
Expensive toys.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,719
First things first, let's do our question, Catherine,

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,760
in which country is the percentage of super rich

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,679
expected to grow fastest over the next 10 years?

18
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,000
Is it a, China, B, Brazil or C, Vietnam?

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,600
I'm going to go for Vietnam, I think that's an upper-coming country

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,200
and I think there's going to be a lot of growth in wealth in the future.

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,920
Okay, well, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later.

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,960
The number of super rich are expected to increase by 43% over the next decade.

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,200
Now this doesn't mean income is rising at the same speed for everyone.

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,120
You might remember a report last year, which said the world's richest 62 individuals

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,160
owned as much as the poorest 50% of people in the whole world.

26
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,960
So, my question is, what on earth the people with so much money spend it on?

27
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,719
One academic in the UK has been researching just that

28
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,719
and her answer is Neil.

29
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,960
Yots. A yacht, a luxury boat used for pleasure,

30
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,680
the ultimate status symbol, that is an item which allows you to show off your wealth

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,360
and position in society.

32
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,280
Let's listen to Emma Spence from Cardiff University of the UK.

33
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,599
What's so unusual about yachts?

34
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:59,439
If you have an exclusive wine collection or art collection or even the purchase of a business jet,

35
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,319
these are investor assets, some of them you can retain value or accrue value on.

36
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:10,800
A business jet, a private jet, can cut costs and make businesses more convenient

37
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,479
by running faster, more comfortably than commercial airlines.

38
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,479
So, these purchases make good sound business sense,

39
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,439
whereas a super yacht is essentially a black hole.

40
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,319
Before we get to the yacht, Emma talked about certain assets like planes and wine that made

41
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,879
business sense. Now, to make sense is a phrase you'll be familiar with,

42
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,599
so if we say something makes business sense, it means it's good for business.

43
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,719
But yachts are different.

44
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,840
Yots and especially what she calls super yachts actually lose money.

45
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,079
So much so, she calls a super yacht a black hole of wealth.

46
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:56,400
Now, a black hole in scientific terms is a place where gravity is so strong

47
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,280
that nothing can escape, not even light.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,039
So, in business terms, a black hole eats all your money.

49
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,599
It's also used, conversationaly, to mean a place where things go missing.

50
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:16,079
These super yachts are big. The world's longest is 180 meters in length,

51
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:20,560
and they require a professional crew, which is how Emma began her study.

52
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,799
She used to work on the yachts.

53
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,359
She's now spent six years studying the world of super yachts and the super rich.

54
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:29,039
So, what else did she learn?

55
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,959
She says that in the world of the super rich, the size of your yacht

56
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,039
shows your place in the pecking order.

57
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:41,039
And the pecking order means the social system from most powerful to least powerful.

58
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,759
If you're higher up in the yachting pecking order,

59
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,479
you get the best place in the harbour, which is very important to yacht owners apparently.

60
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,639
Apparently so. It's all about seeing and being seen.

61
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:58,479
You could actually say that yachts are the ultimate form of conspicuous consumption.

62
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,159
Now, that's another great term.

63
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,840
Conspicuous means visible or noticeable.

64
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,400
And consumption means spending.

65
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,280
So, the phrase conspicuous consumption refers to the kind of buying you do

66
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,960
so that other people notice your money.

67
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,600
Before we sail off into the sunset, Catherine, how about we answer today's question?

68
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,160
I said that Vietnam is the country in which the percentage of super rich is expected to grow fastest

69
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,600
over the next 10 years.

70
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,079
Well, I'm very pleased to say that you were right.

71
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,560
Yay!

72
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,480
Well, in fact, Vietnam.

73
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,120
According to this same report by Night Frank,

74
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,759
the population of ultra-wealthy is expected to grow by a staggering 170% in the next decade.

75
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,840
Now, how about we have another look at the wealth of vocabulary in this programme?

76
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,920
Very good. We started with assets.

77
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,639
Here, it means things we can buy or sell.

78
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,920
What are your assets?

79
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,600
Oh, you know, my diamond rings, my bike, my laptop.

80
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,199
I'm not like you, those Neil.

81
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,279
I don't live in an expensive mansion.

82
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:01,519
That would be a real status symbol.

83
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,199
And if only that were true.

84
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,639
But it's a good example.

85
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,159
A status symbol is a possession that shows off our wealth and our place in society.

86
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:13,439
Yep, and we have the phrase to make business sense.

87
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,680
In other words, to be good for business.

88
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,680
We could also say that a particular policy makes economic sense.

89
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,839
Or, I could say, investing wisely makes financial sense.

90
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,480
Not like yachts which are expensive to buy and run.

91
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,600
In fact, there are black hole for our money.

92
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,640
Now, did you know that our next phrase, pecking order,

93
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,439
actually comes from chicken behaviour.

94
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,319
And finally, the phrase conspicuous consumption.

95
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,080
For example, you could say that dining at the finest restaurants,

96
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,280
wearing expensive clothes is conspicuous consumption.

97
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,319
And to clear up two similar phrases.

98
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,759
A status symbol refers to the object itself, like a luxury car.

99
00:05:54,399 --> 00:06:01,360
Whereas conspicuous consumption refers to the act of spending money on things like expensive cars.

100
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,399
But you're spending money so that other people notice.

101
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,159
Do check us out on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.

102
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,039
Goodbye.
