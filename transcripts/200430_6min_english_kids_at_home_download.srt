00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,719
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,160
And I'm Georgina.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,440
Do you remember the school holidays when you were a kid, Georgina?

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,440
Ah yes, I remember six whole weeks without school.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,039
I used to go to the seaside on holiday with my family.

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,479
Sometimes to the coast in England, and sometimes abroad to France or Spain.

11
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,840
Yes, I remember my dad driving us down to the seaside,

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,920
looking out of the car window and playing eye-spy with my sister.

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,200
But with the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic,

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,480
many children are having to take an extended and unplanned break from school.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,759
And with schools now shut for the foreseeable future,

16
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,399
this is creating challenges, both for children who can no longer meet their friends

17
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,839
to play outdoors.

18
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:04,159
And for parents who want to keep their children occupied and focused

19
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,879
without spending hours watching TV or playing on mobile phones.

20
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,560
In this programme, we'll be discussing some advice for parents trying to keep

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,599
their children educated and entertained at home in these unusual times.

22
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,200
But first, today's quiz question.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,439
Under normal circumstances, which country has the longest school summer holidays?

24
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,439
Is it A, Australia?

25
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,879
B, Argentina?

26
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,640
Or C, Italy?

27
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,840
Mmm.

28
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,120
They have really hot summers in Australia, right?

29
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,159
I think maybe they also have long holidays,

30
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,799
so I'll say A, Australia.

31
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,319
Okay, Georgina, we'll find out later whether you were right.

32
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:49,359
Of course, what's happening right now is very different from normal school holidays.

33
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,759
Parents and children may be living together under lockdown for weeks on end,

34
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,200
and this can be stressful.

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,160
As BBC Radio 4's You and Yours discovered,

36
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,359
when they spoke to parenting expert Elizabeth O'Shea.

37
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,520
The most important thing is to see this as an opportunity.

38
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,080
It's unprecedented what's going on,

39
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,840
but you may have a chance to have two or more weeks with your children,

40
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,360
and if you can change gratitude towards that,

41
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,560
you can actually enjoy this time and teach your children amazing coping skills

42
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,879
for dealing with difficulties in the future.

43
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:27,039
Elizabeth thinks that having a positive attitude

44
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:33,280
by seeing the lockdown as an opportunity will help in this unprecedented situation,

45
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,159
a situation which has never happened before.

46
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,759
Adults of full of life experience and parents can teach their children things

47
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,439
they wouldn't get to learn at school.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,039
Being able to spend time at home with your children can be a great opportunity to teach them

49
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,879
coping skills. Skills they can use to cope or deal with stressful situations.

50
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,879
One of Elizabeth's main ideas is that parents shouldn't try to recreate a school classroom at home.

51
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,599
Instead, it might be better to work with your children as a team

52
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,000
and decide together what you'd like to do.

53
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,079
Here she is talking about keeping kids entertained at home.

54
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,359
I would brainstorm ideas and then draw up timetables

55
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,120
of what you're going to do each day.

56
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,680
Includes a nice chunk of time, normally after lunch for a bit of downtime,

57
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,040
quiet reading or quiet play, but then the rest of the time, building activity.

58
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,240
So playing with your children is wonderful.

59
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:38,000
Ball games, board games, card games, word games, anything, doing a family disco,

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,800
anything that is fun and entertaining for them.

61
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,960
If you lack ideas for what to do during the day,

62
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,960
Elizabeth recommends brainstorming, talking to your children to produce ideas and suggestions

63
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,400
that things to do.

64
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,200
Of course, games and activities are fun ways of keeping children entertained

65
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,439
and she suggests spending a chunk or a large part of time on those.

66
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,000
But it's difficult to find the energy to keep playing games all day long.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,920
It's also important to timetable in downtime, time when you relax and do not do much,

68
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,519
for example, quiet reading.

69
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,479
And if it all starts going wrong, here's Elizabeth again with a final tip.

70
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,759
Pillow fights are also a great made-led off steam.

71
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:26,719
If the situation becomes stressful, then it's good to let off steam.

72
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:31,199
Do something to get rid of strong feelings by expressing them without harming anyone.

73
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,800
You could let off steam in many ways, anything from going for a run to having a pillow fight.

74
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,000
I think I'm going to need a holiday to get over this lockdown.

75
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,439
Which reminds me, it's time to reveal the correct answer to this week's quiz question.

76
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,920
I asked you which countries schools usually have the longest summer holidays.

77
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,639
I said A, Australia.

78
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,560
Good try, Georgina, but the correct answer was C, Italy.

79
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,439
They have up to 13 weeks holiday in the summer.

80
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,279
Imagine how much fun you could have.

81
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,720
Or how much English vocabulary you could learn.

82
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,519
Today we've been giving some tips to parents for surviving the coronavirus lockdown.

83
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:14,159
An unprecedented situation, meaning a situation which has never happened before.

84
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:21,279
One parenting expert recommends keeping a positive attitude by focusing on the useful things

85
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:27,759
parents can teach their children at home, like coping skills. Skills to cope with stressful situations

86
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,359
like being locked down.

87
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:33,199
A good way to generate ideas for things to do is brainstorming,

88
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,719
talking with your children to come up with ideas and suggestions for fun learning activities.

89
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,040
A large chunk or part of the day could be spent in fun ways,

90
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,560
like playing games or finding things out together on the internet.

91
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,120
But don't forget to schedule in some downtime,

92
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,680
quiet time to relax and do nothing.

93
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,000
And when it all gets too much, find healthy ways to let off steam.

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,880
Get rid of strong emotions by doing something energetic, like going for a run.

95
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,480
Or having a pillow fight.

96
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,880
Come on Neil, I always have a pillow handy, just in case.

97
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,240
Well, unfortunately we've run out of time.

98
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,439
Search BBC Learning English for more language learning programs,

99
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,800
as well as English activities for your children during the lockdown.

100
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,519
Bye for now.
