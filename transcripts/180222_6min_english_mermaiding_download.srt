5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,760
Welcome to 6 Minute English, the programme where we explore an interesting topic

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,320
and bring you some useful items of vocabulary.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,080
I'm Rob. And I'm Neil.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,480
Now, Neil, I know you're a keen swimmer.

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,440
I am. I try to get to the pool once a week

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,960
and do a few links, yes.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,759
That's good to hear because swimming is one of the best sports for keeping fit.

12
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,359
It's an aerobic exercise.

13
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,719
Aerobic means a very active type of exercise

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,039
that makes your heart and lungs stronger.

15
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,280
The opposite of this is anaerobic.

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,200
And for my question today, Neil,

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,519
I wonder if you know which of these activities

18
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:50,640
is an example of anaerobic exercise.

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,320
A. Weightlifting.

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,600
B. Kickboxing.

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,040
Or C. Dancing.

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,079
I don't have a clue, but I'll pick my favourite sport.

23
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,920
A. Weightlifting.

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,159
Right. Is that really your favourite sport?

25
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,000
Right. Anyway, we'll find out the answer at the end of the programme.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,519
So, what about you, Rob? Do you visit the swimming pool very often?

27
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:11,280
Oh, only to use the cafe.

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,439
I don't like anything aquatic.

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,200
I mean connected to water.

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,000
I just don't like getting wet and swimming up and down a pool is just boring.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,799
Well, there are alternative to plain swimming.

32
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,719
There's synchronised swimming.

33
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,920
Right. Synchronised.

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,000
That's moving together at the same time or speed as someone else.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,760
Like dancing in water, I suppose.

36
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,319
Hmm. I'm not a good dancer either.

37
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:36,959
How about the new craze of mermaiding,

38
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,120
which is making a splash at the moment?

39
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,039
In other words, becoming very popular.

40
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,960
The idea originated in America,

41
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,439
but is now popular in the UK and Europe.

42
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,039
OK, well, tell me more.

43
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:49,280
Let's hear from an expert, Emma Longdon,

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,120
who's the founder of Fintofit,

45
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,319
which runs classes teaching the skills of swimming safely,

46
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,079
like a mermaid.

47
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,679
Mermaiding is putting a monofin on your feet,

48
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:03,119
putting a beautiful tail on and getting in the water,

49
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,439
and swimming like a mermaid.

50
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,560
OK, so I would need to wear a monofin.

51
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,359
The prefix mono means only one or single,

52
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:15,039
so a single fin, that's like a mermaid's tail.

53
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,639
And then I just get in the water and swim around like a mermaid.

54
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,159
I'm not so sure about that, Neil.

55
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,479
I don't really know how mermaid swim.

56
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,919
There's more to it than that, Rob.

57
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,679
It's actually good for your fitness, as Emma can explain.

58
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:31,519
It gives children's confidence in water's abuse.

59
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,839
It improves their water strength.

60
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:36,879
It gives you an entire body workout.

61
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,519
It works your cardiovascular system.

62
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,719
It works your legs, your core.

63
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,799
It improves the children's swimming technique,

64
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:48,560
flexibility, balance, coordination.

65
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,359
You get the reward, you get the social aspect,

66
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,600
and alongside all of that, they're learning vital life skills along the way.

67
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,400
So there are many benefits to mermaiding, Rob,

68
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,880
improving confidence, strength, technique,

69
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,920
and it's good for your cardiovascular system.

70
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,920
Cardiovascular relates to your heart and blood vessels.

71
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,320
Well, I like the sound of the social aspect,

72
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,160
and by that, Emma means being with other people and having fun.

73
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,480
It's an activity that's sociable,

74
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,560
and it teaches life skills, useful skills,

75
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,120
that help you deal with everyday challenges.

76
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,920
Well, that's great for kids, and that's the problem.

77
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,800
What's that?

78
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,520
Mermaiding is for kids, so I can't get involved, even if I wanted to.

79
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,400
Can I?

80
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,520
You can, Rob.

81
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,120
According to Emma, it's growing in popularity with adults, too.

82
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,520
Any excuse to live out your fantasies, eh?

83
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,840
There are so many adults that actually kind of want to live out their childhood dreams.

84
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,000
They wanted to be mermaid when they were children,

85
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,759
and they didn't get the opportunity, and now it's here, and now it's available.

86
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:53,879
And so yes, we do a lot of adult classes as well.

87
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,960
There you go, Rob, living out your childhood dreams.

88
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,919
That's doing things you wanted to do when you were a child.

89
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,280
Like being a mermaid.

90
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,520
Sorry, Neil, that wasn't a dream for me,

91
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,840
although I did dream of swimming like a shark once.

92
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,840
Anyway, mermaiding is a good form of aerobic exercise,

93
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,159
but earlier, I asked you what an example of anaerobic exercises.

94
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,719
Is it a weightlifting, b.

95
00:04:17,719 --> 00:04:19,800
kickboxing, or c. dancing?

96
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,719
I said weightlifting. Was I right?

97
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,159
You were, Neil, well done.

98
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:25,959
Any exercise that consists of short exertion,

99
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:29,159
high-intensity movement is an anaerobic exercise,

100
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:31,800
such as weightlifting, sprinting, and jumping.

101
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,560
I won't go into scientific detail, but aerobic exercise

102
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,560
is done over a longer period of time and strengthens the heart and lungs,

103
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,000
thereby improving the body's utilization of oxygen.

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,240
Thanks for that, Rob. Now, I think we should sprint through our recap of some of the words we've

105
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,680
talked about today, starting with aerobic, which you just explained.

106
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,639
Mermaiding is a good aerobic workout.

107
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,879
Assuming you don't mind dressing up, of course.

108
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:00,199
Next, we had a quatic, which refers to something connected with water.

109
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,399
Synchronized swimming is an example of an aquatic sport.

110
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:06,680
You slipped in another of our words there, synchronized,

111
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,720
which means moving together at the same time or speed as someone or something else.

112
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,480
We synchronized our watches so that we all arrived at the same time.

113
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,480
Good idea. You're always late, Neil.

114
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,000
Then we mentioned mono, which means one or single,

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,920
and is used as a prefix on words such as monochrome, one color,

116
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,040
or mono-rail, a train running on a single track.

117
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:34,200
Then we heard the word cardiovascular, a word that relates to the effect on your heart and lungs.

118
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:40,440
Experts say those who quit smoking could also quickly reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease.

119
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,839
Finally, we also mentioned social.

120
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:47,639
This adjective relates to activities that you do with other people and are usually fun.

121
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,279
Now I live in London, I have a great social life.

122
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,920
Well, you never invite me out, Rob.

123
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,560
Sorry.

124
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,800
Anyway, that's it for this edition of 6 Minute English.

125
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,000
