5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,560
Hello and welcome to 6Mine at English. I'm Alice.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,440
And I'm Neil. Can you pass me my drink, Alice?

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,160
Cola, Neil. That's very unhealthy.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,120
You told me to stop drinking coffee because it's unhealthy.

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,039
Now you're telling me cola's bad too.

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,519
Cola is full of sugar.

11
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,679
There are about 60 spoons in each can.

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,000
At least that's pretty sugary, I admit.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,119
Well, we're talking about diabetes today.

14
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,280
Diabetes is a condition where the body can't control the amount of glucose

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,280
or sugar in the blood.

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,719
If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications,

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,640
including heart attacks, stroke, kidney failure and blindness.

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,120
I'm not diabetic, though, Alice. So what's the problem?

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,760
Well, diabetes is on the rise or increasing all over the world.

20
00:00:55,839 --> 00:01:00,399
And particularly type two diabetes where risk factors include obesity

21
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,959
or being very overweight, unhealthy diet and lack of physical exercise.

22
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,679
I see. Well, when I think about that, maybe you could ask me today's quiz question.

23
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:14,799
Okay. Can you tell me how many people in the world suffer from diabetes?

24
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:24,640
Is it a 4.15 million, b 41.5 million, or c 415 million?

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,320
I'll take a guess and say b 41.5 million.

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,159
Well, we'll find out if you got the right answer later on, Neil.

27
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,319
Now, why do you think people are eating less healthily than they used to?

28
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,040
Well, processed food has become very popular,

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,680
and whilst it often tastes really good, it isn't always a healthy choice.

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,840
Do you eat a lot of processed food, Neil?

31
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,960
Of course not, Alice.

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,200
Processed food, by the way, is food that's been changed from its natural state,

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,520
for example, by freezing or rehydrating it, or by adding ingredients to it,

34
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,000
such as sugar, salt or fat?

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,040
But let's move on now and talk about exercise.

36
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,600
Okay. But I hope you aren't planning to have fried chicken again for lunch today

37
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,000
from that dodgy fast food joint around the corner.

38
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,879
One reason that people are taking less exercise than they used to

39
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,719
is because of lifestyle changes.

40
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,879
With increasing urbanisation, people are no longer doing jobs that involve

41
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,479
as much physical activity.

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,359
Yes, it's true, and urbanisation means the growth of towns and cities

43
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:30,159
as people move there from the countryside to live and work.

44
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,039
We're all sitting in cars and offices, or on our sofas in front of the TV.

45
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,039
But it's also true that children are less active than they used to be.

46
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:41,759
I remember running around all the time outdoors when I was a kid.

47
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,599
Nowadays, they're all in front of screens, playing computer games,

48
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,359
or watching videos on YouTube.

49
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,560
So adults and children are at higher risk of developing diabetes if they're overweight,

50
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,760
because they're likely to have higher levels of sugar in their blood.

51
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,560
Let's hear more about this from Dr. Etienne Krueg from the World Health Organization.

52
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,080
Well, diabetes can have a continuum,

53
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,600
gradually the levels of sugar in the blood increase,

54
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,440
until reaching the level of being diagnosed with diabetes.

55
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,400
But people before reaching diabetes have too high level of sugar as well sometimes,

56
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,560
and that can be dangerous too, particularly causing cardiovascular diseases,

57
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,240
which contributes to mortality too.

58
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,040
What's a continuum, Alice?

59
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,240
It's something that changes slowly over time.

60
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,120
So in this case, as people increasingly eat food that's high in sugar and fat,

61
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,840
the amount of sugar in their blood increases.

62
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,920
And having a high blood sugar level may reach a tipping point,

63
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,080
or a point when small changes become significant enough to cause a big change,

64
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,840
and you develop diabetes.

65
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,280
But even if you don't develop diabetes, high blood sugar can be damaging to your health.

66
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,000
It isn't only damaging to the individual though.

67
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,039
Diabetes has a huge cost to society.

68
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,560
$827 billion is currently being spent every year to treat the disease.

69
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,520
That's big bucks.

70
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,879
What can we do?

71
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,480
What can governments do to tackle this health crisis, Alice?

72
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,159
Well, a key approach is to tackle the global rise in obesity,

73
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,400
because this address is not only diabetes,

74
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,480
but other diseases too, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.

75
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,759
Let's hear more from Dr. Krug about ways to do this.

76
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,399
We need a combination of approaches to promote physical activity

77
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,240
and to improve the ways we eat.

78
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:35,360
And that goes from breastfeeding or even working with young kids to increase healthy eating.

79
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,680
But the sugar tax is a good example that has contributed in Mexico to a decrease in sales of sugar-y drinks.

80
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,959
Sugar-y drinks just one drink and sometimes represent more sugar than a person needs for the whole day.

81
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,840
Government schemes to encourage healthy eating sound like a good plan,

82
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,960
but trying to get kids to eat vegetables might be tough.

83
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,480
I will stop you from drinking sugary drinks, Neil, for that matter.

84
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,280
Leave me alone.

85
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,319
Oh, all right then.

86
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,079
But the government tax on sugary drinks has worked in Mexico,

87
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,560
and the UK government is also planning to do this.

88
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,840
Okay.

89
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,959
Now, remember I asked you, Neil, how many people in the world suffer from diabetes?

90
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:21,759
Is it a 4.15 million, b 41.5 million, or c 415 million?

91
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,279
Had I said 41.5 million?

92
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,079
Mmm, sorry, that's the wrong answer, Neil.

93
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,599
Of course it's the wrong answer.

94
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:30,879
Yes, I'm afraid so.

95
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,479
According to the Diabetes International Federation based in Belgium,

96
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:40,080
as of 2015, an estimated 415 million people have diabetes worldwide.

97
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,560
This represents 8.3% of the adult population,

98
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,800
with equal rates in both women and men.

99
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,680
Okay, I'll be drinking herbal tea from now on.

100
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,439
Let's listen to the words we learned today.

101
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:59,360
They were diabetes, glucose, on the rise, obesity, processed food,

102
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,200
urbanisation,

103
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,319
continuum, tipping point.

104
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,360
Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

105
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,560
Please join us again soon.

106
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,199
Goodbye.

107
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:09,680
Bye.
