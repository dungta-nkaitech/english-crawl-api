00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,080
Welcome to 6 Minute English, where we bring you an intelligent topic and six related items of vocabulary.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:25,120
I'm Neil and I'm Tim and today we are talking about AI or artificial intelligence.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,960
Artificial intelligence is the ability of machines to copy human intelligent behaviour.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,240
For example, an intelligent machine can learn from its own mistakes and make decisions based

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,000
on what's happened in the past.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,960
There's a lot of talk about AI these days, Neil, but it's still just science fiction, isn't it?

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,079
That's not true. AI is everywhere.

11
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,719
Machine thinking is in our homes, offices, schools and hospitals.

12
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,000
Computer algorithms are helping us drive our cars.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,200
They're diagnosing what's wrong with us in hospitals.

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,039
They're marking student essays.

15
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,520
They're telling us what to read on our smartphones.

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,640
Well, that really does sound like science fiction.

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,719
But it's happening already, you say, Neil.

18
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,560
It's definitely happening, Tim.

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,480
And an algorithm, by the way, is a set of steps a computer follows in order to solve a problem.

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,240
So can you tell me what was the name of the computer

21
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,479
which famously beat world chess champion Gary Kasparov using algorithms in 1997?

22
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,839
Was it A, how? B, alpha 60 or C, deep blue?

23
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:33,839
I'll say deep blue, although I'm just guessing.

24
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:35,759
Was it an educated guess, Tim?

25
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,280
I know a bit about chess.

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,879
An educated guess is based on knowledge and experience and is therefore likely to be correct.

27
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,959
Well, we'll find out later on how educated your guess was in this case, Tim.

28
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,039
Indeed. But getting back to AI and what machines can do.

29
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:55,519
Are they any good at solving real-life problems?

30
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,479
Computers think in zeros and ones, don't they?

31
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,319
That sounds like a pretty limited language when it comes to life experience.

32
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,079
You would be surprised at what those zeros and ones can do, Tim.

33
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,919
Although you're right that AI does have its limitations at the moment.

34
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,879
And if something has its limitations, there's a limit on what it can do or how good it can be.

35
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,680
Okay. Well, now it might be a good time to listen to Zubin Bachramani,

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,439
professor of information engineering at the University of Cambridge,

37
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,159
and Deputy Director of the Leverhulmer Center for the Future of Intelligence.

38
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:32,560
He's talking about what limitations AI has at the moment.

39
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:39,599
I think it's very interesting how many of the things that we take for granted,

40
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,680
we humans take for granted as being sort of things we don't even think about, like,

41
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,080
how do we walk, how do we reach, how do we recognize our mother, all these things.

42
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,840
When you start to think about how to implement them on a computer,

43
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:01,280
you realize that it's those things that are incredibly difficult to get computers to do,

44
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,680
and that's where the current cutting edge of research is.

45
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,360
If we take something for granted, we don't realize how important something is.

46
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,920
You sometimes take me for granted, I think Neil.

47
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,160
No, I never take you for granted, Tim, you're far too important for that.

48
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:24,560
Good to hear. So things we take for granted are doing everyday tasks,

49
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,240
like walking, picking something up, or recognizing somebody.

50
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,880
We implement or perform these things without thinking,

51
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,000
whereas it's cutting edge research to try and program a machine to do them.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,879
Cutting edge means very new and advanced.

53
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,520
It's interesting, isn't it, that over 10 years ago, a computer beat a chess grandmaster,

54
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,080
but the same computer would find it incredibly difficult to pick up a chess piece.

55
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,840
I know, it's very strange, but now you've reminded me that we need the answer to today's question,

56
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:03,759
which was, what was the name of the computer which famously beat world chess champion Gary Kasparov in 1997?

57
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,679
Now you said deep blue Tim, and that was the right answer.

58
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:12,159
You see, my educated guess was based on knowledge and experience.

59
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,560
Oh, maybe you were just lucky.

60
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,519
So the IBM Supercomputer deep blue played against US World Chess champion Gary Kasparov in two

61
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,360
chess matches. The first match was played in Philadelphia in 1996 and was won by Kasparov.

62
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,080
The second was played in New York City in 1997 and won by deep blue.

63
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,639
The 1997 match was the first defeat of a reigning world chess champion by a computer under tournament

64
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:46,400
conditions. Let's go through the words we learned today. First up was artificial intelligence or AI,

65
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,400
the ability of machines to copy human intelligent behavior.

66
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,439
There are AI programs that can write poetry.

67
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,080
Do you have any examples you can recite?

68
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,519
Afraid I don't.

69
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,560
Number two, an algorithm is a set of steps a computer follows in order to solve a problem.

70
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,680
For example, Google changes its search algorithm hundreds of times every year.

71
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,240
The adjective is algorithmic. For example, Google has made many algorithmic changes.

72
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,839
Number three, if something has limitations, there's a limit on what it can do or how good it can be.

73
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,279
Our show has certain limitations. For example, it's only six minutes long.

74
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:32,079
That's right, there's only time to present six vocabulary items, short but sweet and very intelligent too.

75
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,759
Okay, the next item is take something for granted, which is when we don't realise how important

76
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:45,439
something is. We take our smartphones for granted these days, but before 1995, hardly anyone owned one.

77
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,000
Number five, to implement means to perform a task or take action.

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,639
Neil implemented some changes to the show.

79
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,240
The final item is cutting edge, new and advanced.

80
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,079
This software is cutting edge.

81
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,120
The software uses cutting edge technology.

82
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,120
Okay, that's all we have time for in today's cutting edge show,

83
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,439
but please check out our Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages.

84
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,639
Bye bye, goodbye.
