5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,759
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English,

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,240
the programme where we bring you an interesting topic

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,960
and six items of vocabulary. I'm Neil.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,920
And I'm Catherine.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,640
Now this programme is 6 minutes long.

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,039
Yes, it's a 6 minute English.

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,879
And we have a challenge for everyone.

12
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,879
Can you stay focused for the full 6 minutes?

13
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:35,119
Sounds easy. Maybe not.

14
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,240
Because today we're talking about our attention spans.

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,280
Are they shrinking?

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,200
That's right. So we're asking today,

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,159
is the length of time we can focus on something?

18
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,399
That's our attention span, actually getting shorter.

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,079
Now one study says, yes.

20
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:56,560
In fact, it claims the human attention span is now shorter than that of a goldfish.

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,080
Can that be true?

22
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,800
Smartphones, the internet, social media.

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,760
These all certainly do take up a lot of our attention,

24
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,120
but how much?

25
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,960
How long do we look at our mobile phones for in a day, on average?

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,280
Is it A, around 30 minutes?

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,359
B, around 2 and a half hours, or 3 over 3 hours?

28
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,280
I tend to be quite busy,

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,920
but I know some people have really addicted to the mobile phones,

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,320
so I'm going to say around 2 and a half hours, that's answer B.

31
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:29,359
So a report released by Microsoft said the average human attention span

32
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,839
in 2000 was 12 seconds, since then it's fallen to just 8 seconds.

33
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:37,119
Right, and that's a massive change in a very short time.

34
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,000
Now the year 2000 was just before the boom in digital media and smartphones,

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,919
so many people think that they're to blame for all these distractions.

36
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:50,000
Now, distractions are things which take away our focus or attention.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,639
Yes, and we mentioned goldfish earlier.

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,879
Goldfish reportedly have an attention span of 9 seconds.

39
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,120
That's one more than phone obsessed humans with a mere 8 seconds.

40
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,000
And there's a phrase in English we say to have the attention span of a goldfish

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,240
or the memory of a goldfish.

42
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,240
So these poor goldfish near?

43
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,879
Yes, they get a bad press, don't they?

44
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,120
That's a phrase which means criticism, especially criticism in the media

45
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,560
and especially in newspapers or the press as we call it.

46
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,840
So is it really true that humans are now even more easily distracted than fish?

47
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,719
Well, BBC Radio Programme more or less recently investigated this claim.

48
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,280
That's right, and they found out a couple of things.

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,680
Firstly, they couldn't find evidence of the research that Microsoft quoted in their report.

50
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,199
In other words, the programme couldn't find scientific evidence

51
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,159
that our attention spans are in fact shrinking.

52
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:53,359
And secondly, the psychologists they spoke to said there are problems with the idea of

53
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:56,079
measuring attention spans in the first place.

54
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:59,359
It's a term that's widely used, but it's not very scientific.

55
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:01,120
Hmm, sounds fishy.

56
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,240
Yes, fishy means suspicious, by the way.

57
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,479
Sorry, goldfish, again.

58
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,800
So are we humans, in fact, more easily distracted than before?

59
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:15,759
More or less, us Dr. Gemma Briggs, a psychologist at the Open University,

60
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,959
if human beings are less able to focus these days.

61
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,159
It's all down to the individual.

62
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,199
It's all down to how you choose to apply your attention.

63
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:31,359
So attention switching ability may well have developed in recent years in the age of the

64
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:33,120
smartphone and the internet.

65
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,599
But because someone's distracted by their smartphone or wanting to quickly google something,

66
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,120
doesn't mean that they then don't have the ability to control and sustain their attention

67
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,479
when they carry out another task.

68
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,519
So she says we're not necessarily more easily distracted.

69
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,719
Instead, we may actually be better at switching our attention quickly between different tasks.

70
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,120
That's right, she's really saying we can multitask better than before.

71
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,319
And that means we can focus on many different tasks,

72
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,639
each for a shorter period of time.

73
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,959
She said, it's all down to how you choose to apply your attention.

74
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,519
Let's just highlight that phrase down to.

75
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,280
Here it means depends on.

76
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,879
It all depends on how you choose to apply your attention.

77
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,079
So maybe our attention spans aren't getting shorter.

78
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,959
We just choose to look at our phones a lot more.

79
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:24,800
Which reminds me today's question.

80
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,319
I asked you how long on average we spend looking at our phones.

81
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,759
And you said, well my attention span isn't that short that I can't remember.

82
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,680
I said two and a half hours.

83
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,399
And the answer, if you believe the research, is 2.42 hours per day.

84
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,480
So pretty good guess there, Catherine.

85
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,199
Thank you.

86
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,879
That comes from Chicago-based research firm Deskout.

87
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,560
And what about this?

88
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,639
The group they survey touched their mobiles over 2,600 times a day.

89
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,920
Do you touch your phone 2,600 times a day, Catherine?

90
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,919
I try not to. What about you?

91
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,879
It's probably more than that to be honest.

92
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,000
Now, I'm sure everyone wants to get back to touching their phones.

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,959
Or maybe they're even touching them now as they listen.

94
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,319
But either way, let's have a review of today's phrases.

95
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,279
Okay, so first we have attention span.

96
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,159
That's the length of time we can focus on something.

97
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,599
And mine is definitely a fair bit shorter than it used to be.

98
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:20,240
Neil.

99
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,759
Neil?

100
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,680
Oh, sorry.

101
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,800
I just got distracted there by a message on my phone.

102
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,600
Apologies.

103
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,039
That's all right.

104
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,079
So next up we have a bad press.

105
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,159
Goldfish get a bad press.

106
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,480
Social media gets a bad press.

107
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,839
And this means they all get criticism in the media.

108
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,199
And we had fishy.

109
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,759
If something's fishy, it's suspicious.

110
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,359
And we had multitask.

111
00:05:45,359 --> 00:05:48,399
To multitask is to do several things at once.

112
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,159
Then we had down to.

113
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,679
Here it means depends on,

114
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:54,319
though it can mean other things in other context.

115
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,639
You could say it's all down to the context.

116
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,839
And that's our quick review and our programme for today.

117
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,719
So did you stay focused all the way through?

118
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:04,799
Or were you distracted?

119
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,159
If you're looking for distractions,

120
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,160
may I recommend our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages.

121
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,040
Goodbye for now.

122
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,439
Goodbye.
