4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,320
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,160
I'm Sam and I'm Rob.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,120
So, we're well into 2020 now.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,519
How are your new years resolutions going, Rob?

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,359
Ah, resolutions.

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,920
You mean promises people make to themselves to stop or start doing something?

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,760
I promised to start running and to stop eating biscuits

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,600
and to give up alcohol for a month, but I failed on all of them.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,560
Oh, dear.

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,320
Yes, I lasted a few days and then I started to crumble.

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,240
Yeah, well, you're not alone.

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,640
Many people try to kick bad habits and get healthy when a new year begins.

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,560
Their intentions, their plans to do something, are good.

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,840
Yes, giving up drinking is particularly good to do,

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,760
if only for the health benefits.

19
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,159
Well, we'll be talking more about that as soon as I set up today's question.

20
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,719
According to historians, which people were thought to be the first group

21
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,879
to make new years resolutions?

22
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:16,159
Was it the A, Romans, B, Native Americans, or C, Babylonians?

23
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,719
I haven't got a clue, so I'm going to guess A, the Romans.

24
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,719
OK, Rob, I'll let you know if that was a good guess at the end of the programme.

25
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,760
Now let's talk more about giving things up for new year

26
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,560
and specifically giving up alcohol.

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,680
It's a time often called dry January.

28
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,079
Dry refers to not drinking alcohol.

29
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,439
It's not about the weather.

30
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,120
And the beginning of the year seems like a good time to start doing something

31
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,319
to improve your health.

32
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,439
But it's easy to give in to temptation, isn't it, Rob?

33
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,079
Oh, yes.

34
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,280
And it's tough to give up drinking in the first place,

35
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,519
as Millie Gooch, founder of the Sober Girl Society, knows.

36
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,799
She spoke to BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme

37
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,000
and explained why it was hard to quit in the first place.

38
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,079
I think it's the peer pressure and, you know, it's just so expected of us.

39
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,079
It's so ingrained in us.

40
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:10,719
Alcohol is everywhere and it's not just alcohol itself.

41
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,319
It's like alcohol merchandise.

42
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,319
So, you know, you've got Christmas Dumpers

43
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,240
that've been saying, Prosecco, Ho, Ho, Ho,

44
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,319
and you can't buy a birthday card without it saying, let the fun be gin.

45
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,199
It's just absolutely everywhere. It's so hard to avoid.

46
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,719
So that's Millie, who's right when she says that in the UK at least,

47
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,319
we sometimes drink because we give in to peer pressure.

48
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,039
That's the influence a group of similar people have on you to behave like them.

49
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,479
We want to be part of the group, so we copy what they do.

50
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,599
And we are expected to do so because, as Millie said,

51
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,079
drinking alcohol is ingrained in us.

52
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,159
Well, in some cultures anyway.

53
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,199
And when an attitude is ingrained, it means it's been that way for a long time.

54
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,199
It's difficult to change.

55
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,960
And although it may be harmful, we see jokes about drinking

56
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,199
through things like merchandise, a word for goods we buy in cell.

57
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,759
And Millie goes on to say we can buy jumpers

58
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,359
that joke about the Italian sparkling wine called Prosecco,

59
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:12,319
which say Prosecco Ho, Ho, Ho.

60
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,159
And birthday cards have the message, let the fun be gin.

61
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,000
A play on the word begin.

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,120
With all this social pressure, it's hard not to give in.

63
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,599
And that's even worse when you're trying to fulfill your resolution not to drink.

64
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,120
Millie, enough was enough when drinking started to have a negative effect.

65
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,639
And she had to do something about it. Let's hear from her again.

66
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,599
I started realizing that alcohol was actually really effective in my mental health.

67
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,960
So I was getting that really bad hangover anxiety,

68
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,199
that like hangover fear and dread.

69
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,560
And I kind of noticed that that was permeating my everyday life.

70
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,919
I was a mainstream curve rather than like an everyday drinker.

71
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,839
So I just decided that yeah, it wasn't soothing my life anymore.

72
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:57,119
And I wanted to give it up.

73
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,719
So Millie there described the negative effects of a hangover.

74
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,199
That's the sick and tired feeling you get after drinking too much alcohol.

75
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,280
She also said she felt anxiety.

76
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,959
And this feeling was permeating her everyday life.

77
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,000
When something permeates, it spreads through something and influences every part of it.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,680
So drinking was affecting her everyday life and it didn't help that she was a binge drinker.

79
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,319
When you binge, you do something occasionally but too extreme.

80
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,560
Well, Millie managed to quit drinking and hasn't touched a drop since.

81
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,800
There are many benefits to remaining sober.

82
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,560
That means not being drunk.

83
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,519
And one of them is hearing the answer to today's question.

84
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:45,359
Earlier I asked you, according to historians, which people were thought to be the first group

85
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:49,439
to make New Year's resolutions? Was it the A, Romans?

86
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,319
B, Native Americans? Or C, Babylonians? And Rob, what did you say?

87
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:57,199
I had a well guess and said it was the Romans.

88
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,120
Ah, sorry Rob, you are wrong.

89
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,000
Many historians think it was the Babylonians who made the first ever New Year's resolutions

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,240
about 4,000 years ago.

91
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:12,319
According to the history.com website at New Year, which they celebrated in mid-March,

92
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:18,879
Babylonians made promises to the gods to pay their debts and return any objects they had borrowed.

93
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,160
I wonder if they managed to keep their resolutions for longer than I did.

94
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:28,400
Anyway, let's keep one of our regular promises to recap the vocabulary we've discussed today,

95
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,160
starting with resolution.

96
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,800
Which in the context of New Year's resolution is a promise to yourself to stop

97
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,400
or start doing something?

98
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,000
Peer pressure is the influence a group of similar people have on you to behave like them.

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,080
In grain, describes an attitude or idea that has been done in a certain way for a long time

100
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,280
and is difficult to change. And merchandise is a word for goods we buy and sell.

101
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,160
We also mentioned a hangover. That's the sick, tired and sometimes anxious feeling you get

102
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,519
after drinking too much alcohol. And permeating describes spreading through something and

103
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,839
influencing every part of it. Like the vocabulary in this programme, Sam.

104
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,399
Hmm, thanks, Rob. And that's all for now.

105
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:10,879
Bye-bye.
