00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,279
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish.

3
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:16,320
I'm Georgie and we're ready to start, Phil. Phil?

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,640
Oh, sorry, Georgie. I was just catching 40 winks, you know,

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,679
getting some shut-eye, dozing, taking a nap. I was sleeping.

6
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:34,320
Sleeping at work, Phil, how could you? I know, I know, sorry. I didn't sleep well last night.

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,560
I'll forgive you this time, but make sure you go to bed early tonight because

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,920
getting a good night's sleep is incredibly important. For example, did you know that people who

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,640
get enough sleep live about five years longer than people who don't?

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,000
Wow, so a good night's sleep can lengthen your life. In this programme we'll be finding out more

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,439
about the benefits of sleep and its usual learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

12
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:05,439
But first, now that you've woken up, I have a question for you. Do you know how much of the

13
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:13,200
average person's life is spent asleep? Is it A, a half, B, a quarter or C, a third?

14
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,920
I think we spend about a third of our life sleeping.

15
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,159
Okay, well, I'll reveal the correct answer at the end of the programme.

16
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,519
The question of why humans sleep is not easy to answer. In terms of evolution,

17
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:33,200
why would it make sense to go unconscious every night, leaving yourself vulnerable to danger?

18
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,079
It can only mean that the benefits gained from sleep are huge. Here,

19
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:44,319
science journalist Ginny Smith explains some of these benefits to BBC Radio 4 programme inside

20
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,640
science. So we've probably all experienced this that if you've had a bad night's sleep and then

21
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,640
you try and do some work, you just can't concentrate. Your brain isn't in the right state to

22
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,560
take in new information. But we also need to sleep after we've learnt new things because that's when

23
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,439
our brain consolidates the information, takes it from short-term storage to long-term storage,

24
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,000
fits it in with other things we already know. That old adage of if you've got a problem

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,479
sleep on it, your brain does actually work on things during the night and you can often wake up and

26
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:18,080
have solved the problem in your sleep. When we sleep, our brain's refresh, leaving us feeling

27
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,680
rested in the morning. But after a bad night's sleep, it's more difficult to concentrate. We

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,920
can't take in or understand new information. We also have the saying, if you've got a problem,

29
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,920
sleep on it. To sleep on it means to delay making a decision until you've had time to think about it.

30
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,080
But that also turns out to be true scientifically speaking. During sleep, your brain really can work out

31
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,240
problems and find solutions. But what about the other side of the story? What happens when you get

32
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:55,439
too little sleep on none at all? Here's Ginny Smith again talking to BBC Radio 4 program inside

33
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:01,280
science. Sleep deprivation is a form of stress and we know that when you are stressed, your

34
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,760
sort of fight or flight response is activated and that causes all these changes in your body that

35
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:11,519
focus on immediate survival over long term health. But if we are chronically stressed,

36
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,799
money worries or a stressful job or something that's going to lie forever or life,

37
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:20,719
life, life in general. Chronic sleep deprivation that's causing that level of stress,

38
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:25,759
then you might constantly have a damped down immune system which can then lead to all these knock-on

39
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:33,120
problems. Having none or too little of something important is known as deprivation. Sleep deprivation

40
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,560
is stressful for the body. So stressful that it activates a fight or flight response.

41
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,200
Changes in the human body in response to a life threatening situation, which make us either stay

42
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,759
and fight the threat or run away from it. As well as a fight or flight response, the stress of not

43
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:57,680
getting enough sleep over a longer period also creates problems including heart disease and a

44
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,760
weakened immune system. Lack of sleep has these knock-on effects. It causes other things to happen

45
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,920
but not directly. Now do you see why it's so important to get a good night's sleep fill? Plus,

46
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,480
it will stop you sleeping at work again. Right, I think it's time to reveal the answer to my question.

47
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:23,040
Yes, you asked me how much of the average person's life is spent asleep, but I said it was about

48
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:30,480
a third. Which was the correct answer. Assuming you sleep eight hours a day, the average person will

49
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:40,800
sleep for 229,961 hours in their lifetime or around one third of their life. Okay, let's recap the

50
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,000
vocabulary we've learned. Starting with the phrases catch 40 winks, get some shut-eye, dose and take

51
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,480
up all of which mean to sleep. When someone takes in information, they understand it.

52
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,600
If you have a problem and you sleep on it, you delay making your decision until you've had time

53
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,920
to think about it. Depravation is an absence or too little of something important such as food or

54
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,759
sleep. The fight or flight response describes changes in the human body in response to a dangerous

55
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:18,240
situation, which make us either stay and fight threat or run away from it. And finally,

56
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,279
if something has a knock on effect, it causes other results indirectly. Once again, our six minutes
