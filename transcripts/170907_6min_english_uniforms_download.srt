00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,320
Welcome to 6 Minute English, where we introduce a colourful topic and six suitable items of vocabulary.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,320
I'm Tim and I'm Neil.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,920
Why are you wearing a policeman's hat, Tim?

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,640
To get me in the mood for our topic today, uniforms.

8
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:30,719
Well, the hat certainly suits you.

9
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,000
And if something suits you, it looks good on you.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,759
Well, thanks, Neil.

11
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,799
And, funnily enough, I have a question for you on the subject of police hats.

12
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:47,519
In the 19th century, police officers' top hats could be used, A, to stand on,

13
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:53,840
B, as a weapon, or C, to protect their heads from the sun.

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,720
Hmm, well, they're kind of pointy, so I'm going to say as a weapon.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,520
Okay.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,920
Let's consider what the point of a uniform is.

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,280
Why do some jobs have them while others don't?

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,400
Well, the police and other emergency services, like the Fibregate and ambulance service,

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,359
they need practical clothes to help them do their job.

20
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,680
People need to recognise them too, don't they?

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,560
Yeah, that's right.

22
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,600
A uniform makes people stand out from the crowd.

23
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:25,839
If something stands out, it's noticeable or easy to see.

24
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:29,039
But uniforms also allow you to fit in.

25
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:32,399
It shows you belong to a particular group or organisation,

26
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:36,000
and people often enjoy that sense of community at work.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,840
Do you think we should get some six-minute English t-shirts, Maid, Neil?

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,840
Well, we share a sense of community without team t-shirts, Tim.

29
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,799
Let's listen to cultural historian Joe Moran talking about why wearing a uniform

30
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,879
can also allow you to behave differently to the way you normally behave.

31
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,879
It's a role and a genre that you adopt, and it's kind of,

32
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,799
it's something that's not quite you.

33
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,519
It's a kind of persona that you can put on.

34
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,159
In Germany, they call it mask and fry height, which is the freedom conferred by masks.

35
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:14,240
There's something about taking on a, what is very clearly a persona or professional role

36
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,560
that can be liberating, I think.

37
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,200
So when you put on a uniform, you are adopting a role or genre.

38
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,840
Genre means a particular style, and a persona is a character that you present to the outside world,

39
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,400
as opposed to the person you feel like inside.

40
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,280
Joe Moran compares putting on a persona to putting on a mask,

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,320
and he says this can be very liberating.

42
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:47,840
But do you really think putting on a uniform liberates or frees us from the person we really are?

43
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,120
Maybe. If you're shy, for example, a uniform might feel liberating because it allows you to behave more confidently.

44
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,920
So if you could choose a uniform and a new persona, what would it be, Tim?

45
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,719
An airline pilot, I think. I'd look great in a blazer with brass buttons,

46
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,039
or with the cap and the mirror sunglasses.

47
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,759
Hello, this is your captain speaking.

48
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,679
Will shortly be arriving at LAX Airport in sunny Los Angeles.

49
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:20,639
Local time is 12.55, and it's hot, hot, hot outside. So I hope you've backed.

50
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,120
Okay, Tim. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

51
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,919
I can see you'd love to be a pilot, or at least you'd love talking to your passengers.

52
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,359
Well, what about you, Neil? What would you like to try on for size?

53
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:34,719
A surgeon scrubs? Ooh, a nun's habit.

54
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:39,439
To try something on for size means to decide whether it's what you want or not.

55
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,719
No, Tim, I'd go for a chef's apron. Check trousers, a tall hat.

56
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,719
I think the uniform would see you.

57
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,719
But are you good at cooking, Neil?

58
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,400
I'm an excellent cook.

59
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,639
Now, I think we should have the answer to today's quiz question, Tim.

60
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:00,319
Yes, I asked what a police officer's hat could be used for in the 19th century,

61
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,599
and I said as a weapon.

62
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,239
Wrong, I'm afraid.

63
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:13,039
From 1829 to 1839, metropolitan police officers wore a cane reinforced top hat,

64
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,519
which could be used as a step to climb or see over walls.

65
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,519
I wonder if modern police hats are strong enough to stand on.

66
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,639
And we'll try yours later and find out.

67
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,319
But now, let's go over the other key words we learned today.

68
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,319
Okay, if something suits you, it looks good on you.

69
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,920
For example, does this pilot's uniform suit mean Neil?

70
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,399
It suits you down to the ground, Tim.

71
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,560
And that means it suits you very well.

72
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,839
Number two, if something stands out, it's noticeable or easy to see.

73
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,120
My colourful suit really stood out at the party.

74
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,879
In a good way, I hope.

75
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:57,120
Okay, next item to fit in means you belong to a particular group and are accepted by them.

76
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,319
I never fitted in with the cool kids at school.

77
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,079
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Tim.

78
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,079
Maybe you weren't wearing the right uniform.

79
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,319
Number four is Persona.

80
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,959
The character you present to the outside world,

81
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,840
as opposed to the person you feel like inside.

82
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,199
My work Persona is confident and chatty,

83
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,120
but I'm actually rather shy.

84
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,199
I'm learning a lot about you today, Tim.

85
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,879
They're just examples, Neil.

86
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,399
I don't have a work Persona.

87
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,399
That's the nice thing about our job.

88
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,279
There's no need to put on masks or Persona's.

89
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,679
Just the occasional hat, indeed.

90
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,479
And a very nice hat, this is too.

91
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,439
I think I'll keep it.

92
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,359
Now, let's finish the vocabulary.

93
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:40,879
Number five, liberating means feeling you can behave however you like.

94
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:46,079
For example, talking openly about your problems can be very liberating.

95
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,120
And finally, to try something on for size means to test something,

96
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,679
to decide whether you want it or not.

97
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,199
Our listeners can try these new vocabulary items on for size

98
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,680
and decide whether they'll be useful or not.

99
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:07,360
And if not, then please let us know by visiting our Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages

100
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,639
and telling us what you think.

101
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,600
Goodbye.

102
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,079
Bye.
