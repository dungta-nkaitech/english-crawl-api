5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,519
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

6
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:17,359
I'm Sam.

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,400
And I'm Neil.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,679
In this programme, we're discussing low emission zones

9
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,080
and explaining some useful items of vocabulary along the way.

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,320
Well, that's good, Sam.

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,039
But what exactly is a low emission zone?

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,119
Well, the noun emission is an amount of, usually, gas,

13
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:37,079
that is sent out into the air and harms the environment.

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,320
It's pollution.

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,759
And a low emission zone is an area of a city

16
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:43,920
where the amount of pollution is controlled.

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,799
Of course, and cities like London have them.

18
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,399
Most vehicles, including cars and vans,

19
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:52,000
need to meet certain emissions standards.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,840
All their drivers must pay a daily charge to drive within the zone,

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,000
or they might even be banned altogether.

22
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,000
Exactly.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,079
It's all about making the air we breathe cleaner.

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,120
And my question today is about one UK city,

25
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,599
which recently announced it wants to be the country's first net zero city,

26
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:14,439
placing the greenhouse gas emissions at a neutral level.

27
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,079
But which one is it?

28
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:22,879
Is it A, Glasgow, B, Manchester, or C, Cardiff?

29
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,640
Yes, I've heard about this, and I'm sure it's A, Glasgow.

30
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,799
OK, I'll let you know if that was correct at the end of the programme.

31
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:34,680
Now, Neil mentioned that London already has an ultra low emission zone.

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,680
But this year, other UK cities, including Bath, Leeds, and Birmingham,

33
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,439
are also bringing in clean air zones.

34
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:46,960
And around the world, many other cities like Beijing, Paris, and Madrid

35
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,319
have these zones.

36
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,079
Although there are many types of emissions, such as from factories,

37
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,079
these zones predominantly target exhaust fumes from vehicles,

38
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,519
poisonous gases called nitrogen dioxide.

39
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,679
Let's hear from an expert on this, Alistair Lewis,

40
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:07,280
who is a professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of York.

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,879
He spoke to BBC Radio 4's Inside Science programme

42
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,240
and explained why we should be trying to reduce these pollutants,

43
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,759
a word for the substances that cause pollution.

44
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:21,000
Most of the evidence we have now on air pollution

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,599
is that we continue to see health benefits by reducing pollution

46
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,479
even when you're below the target value.

47
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,599
So just because a city meets a particular value,

48
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,879
there is still an incentive to continue to improve air quality

49
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,359
because the health benefits continue to build up as you do that.

50
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:41,199
So targets are very, very good at focusing the mind,

51
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,599
but they shouldn't be the only thing that we're considering.

52
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,079
Alistair Lewis mentions targets.

53
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:49,680
These are official levels of something that need to be achieved.

54
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,599
They give us something to aim for, in this case, reducing air pollution.

55
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,879
He uses the phrase, focusing the mind.

56
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:01,120
That means to concentrate on one idea or thought.

57
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,439
But while setting a target to cut air pollution is good,

58
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:05,959
it has health benefits.

59
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,759
We shouldn't just focus on meeting the target.

60
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,240
Even if the target is met, we shouldn't stop trying to improve.

61
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,079
The incentive should be that we are improving people's health.

62
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:20,879
And an incentive is something that encourages someone to do something.

63
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,159
So I think it's accepted that creating lower mission zones

64
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:29,120
is an incentive because it encourages people to either not drive into cities

65
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,199
or to at least drive low-polluting vehicles.

66
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:37,000
And, of course, changing to electric powered cars is one way to do this.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,599
There's more of an incentive to do this now, at least in the UK,

68
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:43,879
because the government has said new diesel and petrol cars and vans

69
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:46,879
will be banned from 2040.

70
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,960
But pollution from vehicles is just part of the problem,

71
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,000
as Alistair Lewis points out.

72
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:56,960
One has to accept that air pollution is an enormously complex problem

73
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,199
with a very, very large number of contributing sources.

74
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:07,039
And there will never be any one single action that will cure the problem for us.

75
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,800
And so low-emission zones are one way to reduce concentrations.

76
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,039
But they are not in isolation going to be the solution.

77
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:17,360
So Alistair points out that air pollution is a complex problem.

78
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,519
It's complicated, difficult, and involves many parts.

79
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes, there are many sources, things that create these emissions.

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,359
So it's not possible to solve or cure the problem by doing one thing.

81
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:34,560
Low-emission zones are only one part of the solution to the problem.

82
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,199
He said it was one way to reduce concentrations.

83
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,240
He means amounts of substances, pollutants, found in something.

84
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,839
Which here is the air.

85
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:45,719
Well, early in the year, you had to concentrate your mind

86
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:48,319
and answer a question about emissions.

87
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:54,719
I asked which UK city recently announced it wants to be the country's first net zero city,

88
00:04:54,719 --> 00:04:57,560
placing their greenhouse emissions at a neutral level.

89
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:03,120
Was it A, Glasgow, B, Manchester, or C, Cardiff, and Neil, what did you say?

90
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,800
I said it's Glasgow.

91
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,240
And it is Glasgow, well done, Neil.

92
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,639
It wants to become the UK's first net zero city.

93
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,560
And later this year, it is hosting a major United Nations climate change summit.

94
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,800
OK, Sam, I think we need a recap of the vocabulary we've discussed, starting with emissions.

95
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,240
Emissions are amounts of, usually, gas that is sent out into the air from things like cars.

96
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,560
They hunt the environment.

97
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,240
And pollutants are the actual substances that cause pollution.

98
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,639
To focus the mind means to concentrate on one idea or thought.

99
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,840
And we mentioned an incentive, which is something that encourages someone to do something.

100
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,879
Complex describes something that's complicated, difficult, and involves many parts.

101
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,319
And when talking about pollution, we sometimes talk about concentrations.

102
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,599
These are amounts of substances or pollutants within something.

103
00:05:55,599 --> 00:06:01,599
So in a polluted city, we might find high concentrations of nitrogen dioxide because of all the traffic.

104
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:03,199
It's not great for our health, Sam.

105
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,639
Indeed, Neil. That's why we need lower emissions zones.

106
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,919
And that brings us to the end of this six-minute English programme.

107
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,519
See you soon. Bye.
