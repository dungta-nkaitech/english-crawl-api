00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,919
Hello, this is 6-Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:17,120
And I'm Beth. As an adult, when I need to tell somebody something, it's easy.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,039
I just open my mouth and speak. Neil, I'm hungry.

5
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,160
Ah, you better get something to eat then. And when I want something, it's the same.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,000
I just ask, can you pass me that pen please, Beth?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,920
There you go. But imagine a situation where you can't speak.

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,280
You can only communicate with your body. What's more, you're totally help this and can't

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,920
close, feed or wash yourself. It doesn't so much fun, does it, Neil?

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,439
But that's exactly what happened to us all as babies.

11
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:53,840
We've all been one, but how do newborn babies tell mum and dad what's going on before they can speak?

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,800
That's what we'll be investigating in this episode, along with some useful new vocabulary,

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,400
all of which you can find on our website, BBCLearningEnglish.com.

14
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,240
Baby communication is a topic child psychotherapist, Marie D'Aurome, writes about in her new book,

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:18,240
what your baby wants you to know. So what do newborn babies want us to know? Well, here's Marie's answer.

16
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:27,039
I think they want us to know that they need us 100% because without us, they won't survive.

17
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:33,519
Without someone caring for them, babies wouldn't survive. So, on a basic level, every baby is saying,

18
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:41,280
take care of me. Marie says babies need us 100%. She uses the phrase 100% to emphasise that what

19
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,679
she said is completely true. And we'll hear more soon, but first I have a question for you, Neil.

20
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,400
Although they look small and helpless, babies are born with some amazing abilities. So which of

21
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:02,240
the following statements about newborn babies is true? A, babies are born with a full set of teeth.

22
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:10,560
B, babies eyes change colour. Or C, babies have the same number of bones as an adult.

23
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,920
Oh, that's an interesting question. I think I know the answer though, I'm going to go with B,

24
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:22,319
babies eyes change colour. Okay, well, we'll find out if that's right at the end of the programme.

25
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,599
Now, if you've spent time with a baby, you've probably noticed how much they move their little

26
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:34,560
arms and legs. Here, Marie de Rome explains the meaning of these movements to BBC Radio 4 programme,

27
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:44,239
Woman's Hour. 75% of their movement are intentional, synchronised. They're not jerky, we know,

28
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:50,960
to the naked eyes they appear very jerky. But they're not. They're there to bring us

29
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,960
in the parents, you know, they need us to, they all those movements are there to say, look,

30
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,040
come, look at me, I need you, I want you, you know, to play with you.

31
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,400
Babies move their arms and legs to create a bond with their parents. To the naked eye,

32
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,080
these movements look jerky, an adjective meaning sudden and quick, not smooth flowing.

33
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,120
The phrase to the naked eye means in a way that can be seen without special instruments like a

34
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,680
microscope or is seen in the way an ordinary person would. In reality, these jerky movements are

35
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,800
intentional, meaning that they're planned and done for a particular purpose, to catch their

36
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,240
parents' attention so they will be noticed and cared for. Marie's book is aimed at new parents

37
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,200
who are learning to understand their baby's body language. But she also has advice for parents

38
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,080
who are finding it difficult to bond with their newborn, as she explains here to BBC Radio 4

39
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,240
programme Woman's Hour. Parenting is really hard, falling in love with this little baby is not,

40
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,080
you know, this idea that's love at first sight. I think it's such a,

41
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,360
unhelpful cliché. It will take time to love that baby, to get to know that baby.

42
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,840
Many new parents dream about falling in love with their baby at first sight. The idiom

43
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,600
love first sight means being in love with someone as soon as you see them for the first time.

44
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:22,560
But Marie thinks this ideal dream can cause problems. She calls it an unhelpful cliché. A cliché

45
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,920
is an overused phrase or comment that has been said so much that it's become unoriginal and

46
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:34,319
uninteresting. And in some cases unhelpful. For example, by creating unrealistic expectations or

47
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:40,160
by making parents feel guilty, they're not doing enough. Marie says it takes time to get to know

48
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:47,280
a newborn baby and to fall in love. But for most parents, all the misunderstandings, sleepless nights,

49
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,200
and dirty nappies are worth it for their amazing baby. And speaking of amazing babies,

50
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,800
what was the correct answer to your question, Beth? Well, the correct statement was that baby's

51
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,920
eyes changed colour. I think you got that right, Neil. I did. It's an amazing fact, but apparently

52
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:10,480
true. Yes, indeed. Okay, so let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt in this episode, starting with

53
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,959
the phrase 100%, which can be used to emphasise that you completely agree with something,

54
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:23,120
or that you consider something to be completely right or wrong. If you describe a movement as jerky,

55
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,600
you mean it moves suddenly and stops and starts rather than flowing smoothly.

56
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,759
The adjective intentional means planned and purposeful. The phrase to the naked eye means in a way

57
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,480
that can be seen without special instruments or to someone without special knowledge.

58
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:44,240
The idiom love at first sight describes the experience of starting to love someone as soon as

59
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,480
you see them for the first time. And finally, an unhelpful cliche is an overused phrase or comment,

60
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:56,160
a cliche, which has the effect of creating unhelpful or unrealistic attitudes.

61
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,960
Once again, our six minutes are up, but remember you can find many more episodes, plus a quiz
