00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,519
Hello, this is 6MIT English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,039
And I'm Sam.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,679
Have you seen my lottery tickets, Sam? I seem to have lost it somewhere.

8
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,480
This is another one of your get rich quick schemes, Neil.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,159
People invent all kinds of ways to make a loss of money quickly and with little effort.

10
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:40,880
Well, if you really want to get rich quick, maybe you should copy technology Tycoon Elon Musk.

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,039
Recently, he invested $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.

12
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,159
Bitcoin has made some people very rich very quickly, but as we'll be hearing in this program,

13
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,840
it's not without its critics.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,880
Creating Bitcoins, a process known as mining, uses huge amounts of electricity

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,000
and green campaigners and are questioning Bitcoin's impact on global energy use.

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,240
But before we find out more, it's time for my quiz question.

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,359
What year was Bitcoin first released?

18
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:23,280
Was it A 2009, B 2015 or C 2019?

19
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,359
I'll go for B 2015.

20
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,599
Okay, we'll find out the answer later in the program.

21
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:37,439
In this program, we are going to talk about Bitcoin, the use of the virtual currency.

22
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,439
It's all very well for billionaires like Elon Musk, but what about the ordinary average person?

23
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,079
Is Bitcoin a good option for them?

24
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,799
Well, that's exactly what BBC World Service Programme tech tent wanted to find out.

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,560
By interviewing people in the street, here's what one Bitcoin fan, Heather Delaney, had to say.

26
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,560
I invested in Bitcoin a number of years ago with the initial investment of only around $5.

27
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,039
It meant that my risk was essentially the cost of a cup of coffee in a pastry.

28
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,519
And as somebody who's quite risk-averse when it comes to investment,

29
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:18,560
it did allow me to dip my toe into Bitcoin.

30
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,319
Over time, I was able to invest at various points,

31
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:29,759
as I really see Bitcoin as more of a long-term investment and part of my overall pension plan.

32
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,199
Heather describes herself as risk-averse.

33
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,000
She wants to avoid risks as much as possible.

34
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,319
By only investing $5, she was able to dip a toe into Bitcoin,

35
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,159
try doing something slowly and carefully to test whether she liked it.

36
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,120
Over time, Heather's Bitcoin investment became part of her pension plan,

37
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,599
a financial plan funded by your salary to save money for when you retire.

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,120
So everything seems to be working out for Heather.

39
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,360
But the recent buzz around Bitcoin has also highlighted another

40
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,680
less positive side of the story.

41
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,840
Bitcoin's environmental footprint.

42
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,719
Mining Bitcoin's, the complex process that creates new coins, uses a lot of electricity.

43
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:24,159
Recent estimates show that Bitcoin has now overtaken the entire annual electricity use of Argentina.

44
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,599
Michelle Raox works at Cambridge University Centre for Alternative Finance,

45
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,800
which monitors Bitcoin's electrical consumption.

46
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,800
Here he is in conversation with BBC World Services, tech tent.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,439
Bitcoin consumes just a colossal amount of electricity.

48
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,240
Now whether that electricity expenditures really worth the benefits or

49
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,520
think that really depends on how you value Bitcoin itself.

50
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,800
But just looking at the electricity consumption, I think we need to put things a bit into perspective.

51
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,800
So on the one hand, if you compare it to a country like Argentina,

52
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,120
it's just incredible in the wind's firing.

53
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,280
On the other hand, if you compare it to, for example, home appliances that are always on

54
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,120
standby but not being used in the US alone, that consumes twice as much electricity on the

55
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
yearly basis than the entire Bitcoin network.

56
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,920
Michelle, thanks that to assess Bitcoin's energy use, we must put things into perspective,

57
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,879
find the true objective value of something.

58
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,360
Comparing Bitcoin's energy use to a huge country like Argentina sounds monstrous.

59
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,480
But looked at another way, Bitcoin only consumes half the electricity used by all US

60
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,720
televisions and other home appliances left on standby, which means powered on and ready to work when needed.

61
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,920
So maybe the best get rich quick scheme is to save money on your electricity bills by turning off

62
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:59,680
your TV e-neil. Well, it's got to be easier than mining bitcoins, which reminds me.

63
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:08,400
Your quiz question, you asked what year Bitcoin was first released? 2009, 2015 or 2019.

64
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,280
And I said B, 2015.

65
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,519
Which was the wrong answer I'm afraid Sam, it was first released in 2009.

66
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,519
So maybe we'd better keep buying lottery tickets. After all, it's a pretty good get rich quick scheme,

67
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,680
a way to make a lot of money quickly.

68
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,399
Let's recap the other vocabulary now. Someone who is risk averse doesn't like taking risks.

69
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,399
If you dip a toe into something, you test it out slowly and carefully to see how it feels.

70
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,279
A pension plan is a way of saving money for your retirement.

71
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,680
Pushing things into perspective means assessing the real importance of something,

72
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,079
often by comparing it to something similar.

73
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,199
Like comparing the energy use of Bitcoin with the energy used by electrical appliances left on

74
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:10,639
standby, ready to be used. And that's all we have time for. Bye for now. Bye bye.
