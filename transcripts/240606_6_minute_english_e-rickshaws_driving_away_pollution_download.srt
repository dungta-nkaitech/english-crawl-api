00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,240
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:19,839
And I'm Beth. I had my first drive in an electric car yesterday, Neil. It was amazing.

4
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,160
Electric cars are great in theory, but who has the money to buy one?

5
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:30,960
It's true that electric vehicles or EVs, as they're also called, are expensive.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,519
But in some parts of the world, the switch to electric vehicles has been a major success story

7
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:43,519
in the fight against climate change. And it's not just rich people switching to electric.

8
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:46,719
In India, poorer workers are embracing it too.

9
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,200
Yes, in India, it's the drivers of small vehicles like motorbikes,

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,280
mopeds, scooters and rickshaws, known as two and three wheelers who dominate the road.

11
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,880
And now, over half of these are electric. In this program, we'll be discussing the growing

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,480
role of electric vehicles in the fight against climate change. And as usual, we'll be learning

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,960
some useful new vocabulary as well. Great. But first, I have a question for you, Neil.

14
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:22,319
In India, many different vehicles use the road, but which country's car market is the biggest?

15
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,039
Is it A, the US, B, China or C, Japan?

16
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:32,879
Well, I'll guess it's the US that has the world's largest automobile market.

17
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,079
Okay, Neil. I'll reveal the answer at the end of the program.

18
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:43,679
While electric vehicles score better than petrol or diesel cars in most environmental tests,

19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,720
there is some debate about exactly how green they are. A lot depends on how the electricity is

20
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,880
generated in the first place. And in India, more than three quarters of the electricity used

21
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,360
continues to be generated by coal. Nevertheless, in India, the transition to green transport is

22
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,439
well underway. Here's Louise Rebay, head of the climate organisation C40 cities,

23
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:15,759
explaining the appeal of EVs to Greia Jackson for BBC World Service Program, the climate question.

24
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,960
What is it about two and three wheelers that serve peeling?

25
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:26,079
I think it can be summarized in one word and its convenience from an accessibility and affordability,

26
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:32,639
an efficiency point of view. And on that first point of accessibility, the state of public transport

27
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:38,319
is not as developed as it is in places like London or Singapore. There's no Metro lines or

28
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:45,039
or Fancy Bus Networks and two and three wheelers spread in response to the slack of sufficient

29
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,400
or high quality frequent public transport infrastructure.

30
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:56,319
Greia asks why electric vehicles are so appealing, so desirable and attractive.

31
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,400
There are several reasons behind EVs appeal, including convenience and affordability,

32
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,719
being cheap enough for people to buy.

33
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:10,319
In places without reliable public transport, electric scooters are filling the gap.

34
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,159
That's really needed because the massive increase of petrol cars in Delhi has created a toxic

35
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:23,360
and very serious health risk. Smog. Smog is air pollution caused by a mixture of smoke, chemicals

36
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,520
and especially car exhaust fumes. It makes the atmosphere difficult to breathe and very unhealthy.

37
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,560
What's more, because children are smaller and closer to car exhaust pipes,

38
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,920
smog affects them most. In winter, the air in Delhi gets so bad they have to close the schools,

39
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,800
sometimes for weeks. Here's Greia Jackson again, taking up the story for BBC World Services,

40
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,000
the climate question.

41
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,600
They're having to shut schools because the pollution is so bad. Gosh, that's hardly a solution,

42
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:04,719
what can be done about it? Well, for India, the solution partly lies in switching to

43
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:13,199
electric scooters and e-richshaws. By 2030, the government wants 30% of its vehicles on the road

44
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,639
to be electric and has put up 1.2 billion dollars to make that happen.

45
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,360
When Greia discusses schools shutting because of air pollution, she uses the word gosh.

46
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,280
An expression uses show a strong feeling of surprise or wonder.

47
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,040
Luckily, the Indian government is taking measures to improve Delhi's air quality,

48
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,600
largely through the switch to greener electric vehicles. The government has put up over 1 billion

49
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,920
dollars to make this happen. The Frazelberg put up money for something, means to provide the money

50
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,920
needed to pay for it. In this area, it seems India is leading the world, which reminds me of your

51
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:00,800
quiz question, Beth. That's right. I asked you which country has the world's largest automobile

52
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:08,480
market, and you said the US. Which was the wrong answer I'm afraid, Neil. In fact, it's now China

53
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:14,800
that tops the list, showing that when it comes to green transport, bigger isn't always better.

54
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,040
Right, it's time to recap the vocabulary we've learned in this program, starting with two wheeler,

55
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,920
a vehicle with two wheels, such as a bicycle, motorbike or mopage.

56
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,319
The adjective appealing means attractive, desirable or interesting.

57
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:36,960
Affordability refers to being cheap enough for people to buy, or in other words, inexpensive.

58
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,960
Smog is air pollution caused by smoke and car fumes, which makes the atmosphere unhealthy

59
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:49,920
and difficult to breathe. Gosh is an expression used to show a strong feeling of surprise or wonder.

60
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,600
And finally, if you put up the money for something, you provide the money needed to pay for it.

61
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,160
