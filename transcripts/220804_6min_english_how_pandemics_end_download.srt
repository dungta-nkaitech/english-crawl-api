00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,920
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,839
And I'm Neil. In March 2020, the World Health Organization, the WHO,

4
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:29,839
declared Covid-19 a pandemic. Now, after two and a half years in the shadow of Covid,

5
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:35,039
for many people, travel restrictions are ending, and many people around the world are starting

6
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:40,480
their lives again. But not everyone. Whether it's because of lockdowns and not seeing friends,

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,719
or getting sick, even dying, everyone wants to see an end to the pandemic. But with cases of Covid

8
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,519
infections still in the millions, and doctors warning about new variants of the disease,

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,280
is the pandemic really coming to an end? In this programme, we'll be finding out how pandemics end,

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,200
and, as usual, we'll be learning some related vocabulary as well.

11
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,000
Of course, pandemics are nothing new. Ancient texts are full of stories of

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,760
plagues which spread death in disease before eventually going away. In the middle ages,

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,280
the black death that killed over half of Europe's population lasted for four years.

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,519
It's only with modern vaccines that diseases have been eradicated, completely ended.

15
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:30,400
So, Neil, my question this week is, which disease was eradicated in 1977?

16
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,680
Was it A, cholera, B, polio, or C, smallpox?

17
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,719
I'm going to say C, smallpox.

18
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,840
Okay, I'll reveal the answer at the end of the programme.

19
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,960
Of course, the idea that the pandemic might not be ending isn't something people want to hear.

20
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,480
Most people are sick of worrying about Covid and can't wait for things to get back to normal.

21
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,320
But as Yale University Physician Professor Nicholas Christakis explained to BBC World Service

22
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,599
programme, the inquiry, it's not just the biological disease that needs to end.

23
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,920
Pandemics have a social ending too.

24
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,039
Pandemics are not just a biological phenomenon, they're also a social phenomenon,

25
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,159
and they end socially. And one of the ways that they end socially is when everyone just

26
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,599
sort of agrees that they have ended, when everyone is simply willing to tolerate more risk.

27
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,359
In other words, we sort of declare victory, maybe prematurely, or another way of thinking about it

28
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:28,639
is we put our heads in the sand.

29
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,800
Biologically, Covid still exists in the world, and most of us would rather not catch it.

30
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,439
But if you're vaccinated, the risk of getting seriously ill is much lower.

31
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,960
So it's reasonable to make plans to resume normal life.

32
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:49,439
When enough people do this, we declare victory, a phrase meaning to announce something to be finished

33
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,600
before it actually is. But when it looks good enough.

34
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,600
The danger is that we declare victory prematurely, too soon before it's the best time to do so.

35
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,680
Professor Christakis uses another idiom for this to bury your head in the sand,

36
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,960
meaning to deliberately refuse to accept the truth about something you find unpleasant.

37
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,320
It's also true that pandemics do not end in the same way for everyone everywhere.

38
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,680
Rich, Western countries with the resources to vaccinate their populations are in a better position

39
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,800
than most. Professor Dora Varga is an expert on the history of medicine.

40
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,600
She compares the Covid pandemic to an ongoing disease for which we have no cure

41
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,960
and which has killed millions since its outbreak in the 1980s, HIV AIDS.

42
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,920
Here is Professor Varga speaking with the BBC World Services, the inquiry.

43
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:49,520
What happens with the case of HIV AIDS is that it became from being an immediate death sentence

44
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,360
basically to a manageable chronic disease. But that happens in societies that have the means

45
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,400
and the infrastructure to make that possible with medication.

46
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,400
And that is not necessarily true for all parts of the world.

47
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,039
But we don't think about the HIV AIDS pandemic as an ongoing pandemic.

48
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,319
Although HIV has no cure, modern medical drugs allow people to continue living with the disease

49
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:21,040
for years. HIV is no longer a death sentence, a phrase meaning the punishment of death for

50
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,759
committing a crime or from an incurable disease. Nowadays, HIV is no longer fatal.

51
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,719
It has become a disease which can be controlled and is chronic or long-lasting.

52
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:36,879
We no longer think of AIDS as a pandemic, but that's not true everywhere,

53
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:41,439
only in countries which can provide the necessary medical drugs and support.

54
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:46,319
Finding the right balance of Covid restrictions for communities of people exhausted by the

55
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:52,159
pandemic is an easy. Many scientists are warning that we haven't yet reached the beginning of

56
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:57,519
the end of Covid, but hopefully we're at least reaching the end of the beginning.

57
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:04,000
Let's finish the programme on a hopeful note by remembering that diseases can and do eventually end.

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Like in your quiz question, Sam.

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,799
Ah yes, I asked which disease was eradicated in 1977. Neil said it was smallpox,

60
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:15,439
which was the correct answer. Well done, Neil.

61
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:23,279
Smallpox no longer occurs naturally, but did you know that samples of smallpox do still exist,

62
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,519
frozen in American and Soviet laboratories during the Cold War?

63
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,439
As if the thought that the Covid pandemic might never end isn't scary enough.

64
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,959
Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt,

65
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,839
starting with eradicate to completely get rid of something such as a disease.

66
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,959
If you declare victory, you announce something to be finished before it actually is.

67
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,599
The danger in doing this is that you announce it prematurely or too soon.

68
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,680
The idiom, bury your head in the sand, means to refuse to accept or look at a situation you don't like.

69
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,520
A death sentence means the punishment of death for committing a crime or from an incurable disease.

70
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,760
And finally, a chronic disease is one which lasts for a long time.

71
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,560
Even though the pandemic hasn't ended, our programme has because our six minutes are up.

72
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,760
Bye for now. Bye.
