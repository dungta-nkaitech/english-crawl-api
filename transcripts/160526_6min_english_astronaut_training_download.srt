5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,599
Hello and welcome to 6MuteEnglish. I'm Alice.

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,000
And I'm Rob. So Rob, what job did you want to do when you were little?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,640
Oh, I really wanted to be an astronaut.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,280
Being orbit, watching the Earth from afar.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:31,520
Wow, be in orbit. It means be in space and following the Earth's curvature.

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,000
Well, the view must be nice from up there.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,760
But the reality of becoming an astronaut is pretty hard.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,760
And it's the subject of today's show.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,799
Did you know that less than 600 people have been into space so far?

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,120
I'd like to have been one of them.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,680
I know I have what it takes to be a space man.

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,079
Yes, there are many others like you who would like to go for this job, Rob.

17
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,479
And that's the quiz question for you today.

18
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:02,239
How many people have applied to join NASA's 2017 astronaut class?

19
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:10,159
Was it A, 800, B, 8000 or C, 18000 people?

20
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:13,280
8000 sounds like a lot already.

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,439
So I'll go for B, 8000 people.

22
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,319
Well, we'll find out if you chose the right answer later on in the programme.

23
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:26,159
So what do you think is the biggest challenge when considering becoming an astronaut?

24
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,719
Well, I'd say claustrophobia.

25
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,119
And that means fear of being in a small space.

26
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,280
That might be a problem because the space capsules are small and you're with the same people

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,719
for months at a time.

28
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,119
Yes, that's right. Well, astronauts are bound to get on each other's nerves sometimes.

29
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,479
To get on someone's nerves means to annoy them.

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,240
But I'm a great team player, so I think I'll be okay.

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,680
Yes, I can confirm that.

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,480
Anyway, the challenge of being an astronaut doesn't stop here.

33
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,520
In the space capsule, astronauts have to put up with extremely difficult conditions,

34
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,520
like zero gravity, for example.

35
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,319
Yeah, it looks like funding some assaults in the capsule and catching bits of food in your mouth

36
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,680
as it floats out of its packet.

37
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,759
But zero gravity, a condition where gravity is exerting no force,

38
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,239
can lead to wasting of the bones and muscles.

39
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,120
Astronauts take two and a half hours of exercise per day to help prevent this.

40
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,959
But what do astronauts have to do before they go into space to prepare themselves for weightlessness

41
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,239
and spacewalking?

42
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,639
They can practice using a virtual reality headset and special gloves.

43
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,239
It's like playing a computer game that looks and feels like doing a spacewalk.

44
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,919
And they also train in a swimming pool.

45
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,599
Let's listen to Major Tim Peek, a British astronaut talking about the preparation he did

46
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,000
for his mission on the International Space Station.

47
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:53,759
The way we practice spacewalking is in water.

48
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,079
Water gives us the neutral buoyancy that we need.

49
00:02:56,079 --> 00:03:00,639
So we sink training modules into swimming pools and then practice the spacewalking on them.

50
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,919
We wear very specific equipment, a pressurized space suit.

51
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,679
Very difficult to move in, actually.

52
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:10,079
It's hard to bend the fingers, it's hard to bend your arms and it really gives you quite a difficult workout.

53
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,720
British astronaut Tim Peek says water gives us buoyancy, which is the ability to float.

54
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,320
Floating in space is similar to floating in water.

55
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,320
So astronauts practice their spacewalk in swimming pools.

56
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,680
Yes, they take to the water and to the air too.

57
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,520
Astronauts experience the feeling of weightlessness in planes.

58
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,680
A large plane with padded walls flies to high altitude and then goes into a nose dive

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,640
or a fast and sudden fall, which creates short periods of weightlessness.

60
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,879
Oh, fabulous. I'd love to do that.

61
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,800
But it's not all fun and games.

62
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,599
Don't forget that one of the main reasons for being out on the International Space Station

63
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,360
is to conduct research.

64
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,560
Major Tim Peek is doing scientific experiments such as how to grow plants in space

65
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,800
and what effect radiation and zero gravity have on this process.

66
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,360
Like that film where an astronaut gets stranded or left behind on Mars

67
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,880
and has to grow potatoes, the film's called the Martian.

68
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,240
That's right, yes.

69
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,080
So do you think you have what it takes to survive in a challenging environment, Rob?

70
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,240
Let's listen to Major Tim Peek talking about his survival training.

71
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,639
Survival training, and for this, the European Space Agency send us to Sardinia.

72
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,759
When you land in the Soyuz capsule, sometimes you might not land exactly where you expect to be.

73
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,600
Foraging for food, for example, and your basic elements of shelter and protection,

74
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,680
getting water, going live in a cave for seven days with an international crew.

75
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,000
And it's a wonderful environment to prepare you for a mission because you are very isolated.

76
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:49,120
So astronauts may get stranded on Earth when the space capsule lands somewhere unexpected

77
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,560
and they have to find food.

78
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,000
Forage means to search.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,080
Hmm, it's a word we often use to describe how animals search for food.

80
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,960
Indeed.

81
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,720
Well, let's go back to that quiz question you asked me earlier, Alice.

82
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,680
I'm keen to know how many people want to live this experience of being an astronaut.

83
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,200
Okay, well, I asked how many people have applied to join NASA's 2017 astronaut class?

84
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:20,800
Was it A, 800, B, 8000 or C, 18000 people?

85
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,640
Hmm, am I so quite a lot at B, 8000 people?

86
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,960
And you were wrong, I'm afraid.

87
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:35,680
According to NASA's website, more than 18,300 people applied to join their 2017 astronaut class.

88
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,359
This is almost three times the number of applications received in 2012 for the most recent astronaut class.

89
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:44,399
Wow, so there's no chance of me ever succeeding.

90
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,079
Oh, well, you mustn't give up, Rob.

91
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,279
Anyway, we are running out of time, so here are the words we heard today.

92
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:58,479
In orbit, claustrophobia, get on someone's nerves, zero gravity,

93
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:05,199
buoyancy, nose dive, stranded, forage.

94
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,399
Well, that's the end of today's six minute English.

95
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,759
Please join us again soon.

96
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,560
Bye-bye.
