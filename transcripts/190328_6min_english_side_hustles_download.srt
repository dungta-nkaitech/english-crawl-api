00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,200
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,359
This is the programme wherein just 6 minutes,

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,679
we discuss an interesting topic and teach some related English vocabulary.

7
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:23,120
Joining me to do this is Rob.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,000
Hello.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,560
Now Rob, we know your main job is to work here at BBC Learning English,

10
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,399
but do you have a second job?

11
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,920
Ha, there's no time for two jobs, Neil, but if there was,

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,560
I think I take photographs and sell them.

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,439
I do love photography, so I might as well make some money from it.

14
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,640
Good thinking, Rob.

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,479
And having a second job, particularly one that involves using your skills

16
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,239
and allows you to follow your interests is called a side hustle.

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,599
Yes, a side hustle.

18
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:52,960
It's something more and more of us are involved with these days.

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,280
And that's what we'll be talking about shortly.

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,079
Well, my side hustle should be Quizmaster,

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,759
because I'm always asking questions.

22
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:01,600
And today is no exception.

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,120
According to the Employee Ratings website Glassdoor,

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,840
which job is thought to be the best to have in the UK this year?

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,159
Is it a software engineer,

26
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,759
be a teacher or see an audit manager?

27
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,359
Hmm, well, I suspect be a teacher.

28
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,719
Well, you'll just have to wait until the end of the programme to find out,

29
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,239
but let's talk more about side hustles or a second job.

30
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,280
For some people, having two jobs is a necessity,

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,119
a way to make ends meet.

32
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,719
That means having just enough money to pay for the things you need.

33
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,000
That's true, but it now seems that more people

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,319
want to put their skills and passions into practice to make extra money.

35
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,799
According to research by Henley Business School,

36
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,280
around one in four workers run at least one side hustle business,

37
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,159
half of which was started in the past two years.

38
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,159
Those aged 25 to 34 are most likely to be involved,

39
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,759
with 37% thought to run a sideline of some kind.

40
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,479
A sideline also describes an extra job you do alongside your main job.

41
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,199
BBC Radio 5 Live spoke to someone whose side hustle was so satisfying

42
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,439
that it turned into her day job.

43
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,840
Here is Elspeth Jackson, founder of Ragged Life, to explain why.

44
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:20,800
It's a different environment entirely because

45
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,560
you're leaving essentially a very regular wage

46
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,759
that you'd get the same amount in month after month.

47
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,560
You can put aside savings, the same amount every month,

48
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,719
and you have that certain amount of security.

49
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,879
But now I don't think I could go back to one of these big companies

50
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,360
because you'd essentially be sacrificing the flexibility,

51
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,080
which is something I've become very accustomed to now.

52
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,640
Things have worked out well for Elspeth, but there were risks.

53
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,240
For example, leaving behind the security, the safety

54
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,280
of a regular job and of course a regular income.

55
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,080
Elspeth, like making rag rugs, this has given her flexibility in her life

56
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,159
and returning to work at a big company, will be sacrificing that.

57
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,120
That means giving something up or going without it.

58
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,879
And for Elspeth, her side hustle has become a full-time job,

59
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,360
and she's become accustomed to her lifestyle.

60
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,040
It's become familiar or normal.

61
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,840
The BBC also spoke to Becky May Ford, who works some of the time

62
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,879
for a telecommunications company to pay the bills,

63
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,080
but spends the rest of her time developing her own crafting company, Elbico.

64
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,000
How did she find having two jobs?

65
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,439
I think it just gives me creative balance.

66
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:39,680
And obviously working for the telecom's firm, it gets me at the house,

67
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,560
it gets me to meet people in a social environment.

68
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,319
It can be difficult to struggle with the two, that is definitely.

69
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,240
It's definitely a grind, it's a lot harder than people think it's going to be.

70
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,600
So Becky implies that it's not always easy to have a side hustle.

71
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,080
The benefit for her is the creative balance,

72
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,159
a good mix of doing office-based work, regular tasks and a routine,

73
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,159
with working creatively, making things and getting pleasure from it.

74
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,920
But juggling or balancing these two things is difficult,

75
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,240
and she described her side hustle as sometimes being a grind,

76
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,439
hard work, tiring and occasionally boring.

77
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:19,360
But overall, it does make her happy.

78
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,280
Something that would make me happy is to give you the answer to today's quiz question.

79
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,079
Earlier I asked you, according to the Employee Ratings website Glassdoor,

80
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,160
which job is thought to be the best to have in the UK this year?

81
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,560
Is it a software engineer,

82
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,720
be a teacher or see an audit manager?

83
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,040
Yes, and I said be a teacher, always the best job in the world.

84
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,720
Sadly not Rob, apparently it is see an audit manager,

85
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,680
that is considered to be the best jobs to have this year.

86
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,080
Audit managers are responsible for organizing and overseeing internal audits.

87
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,720
The result was based on three factors, average annual-based salary,

88
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,160
the current number of job openings and job satisfaction,

89
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,640
according to Ratings shared by employees on the website over the past 12 months.

90
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,840
So sounds like an interesting job for a side hustle,

91
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,280
but before I head off for a career change, let's remind ourselves of the main vocabulary we've

92
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,319
discussed, starting with to make ends meet.

93
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,479
When we make ends meet we have just enough money to pay for the things we need.

94
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,079
Next we mentioned a sideline which describes an extra job you do alongside your main job.

95
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:35,679
Then we had sacrificing, that means giving up something important or going without something.

96
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:38,799
A custom is a word to mean usual or normal.

97
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:42,479
If you get accustomed to doing something, it becomes the normal way of doing it,

98
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,000
it becomes familiar.

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,360
We also talked about the expression creative balance.

100
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,160
That describes getting the best mix of doing creative and uncreative tasks.

101
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,680
And finally grind describes doing something that is tiring,

102
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,360
difficult, sometimes boring and involves lots of effort.

103
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,319
Well, this programme has not been a grind, Rob.

104
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,319
It's been six minutes of pleasure.

105
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,120
