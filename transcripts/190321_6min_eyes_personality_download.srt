From BBC Learning English

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,040
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,080
And I'm Rob.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,800
Now, Rob, would you say that you are an introvert or an extrovert?

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,719
Hmm, what a good question.

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, extroverts are confident in their personality,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,600
their outgoing and comfortable in social situations.

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,039
So I would have to say that if anything, I'm the opposite.

12
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,160
I'm more of an introvert, I'm really quite shy.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,960
I feel uncomfortable in social situations.

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,920
For example, if I go to a party where I don't know anyone,

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,200
I usually feel very embarrassed and I find it impossible

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,439
to start conversations with strangers.

17
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,159
But you do all of this on the radio and videos

18
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:52,400
for BBC Learning English, don't you?

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,920
Some would say you have to be an extrovert to do what we do.

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,960
Oh, well, maybe I'm pretending to be an extrovert.

21
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,799
To hide the fact that I'm an introvert, it's quite a common thing, you know.

22
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,320
Well, it might not be so easy to hide in the future

23
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,960
because researchers have developed a computer program

24
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,640
that can tell your personality from looking at where you look

25
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,319
by tracking your eye movements.

26
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,200
Wow, that sounds pretty high-tech and scary.

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,040
Well, we'll learn more shortly.

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,240
But first, a question on the topic of clever computers.

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,719
The letters AI stand for artificial intelligence.

30
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,519
But what are the letters AI?

31
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,959
Are they A, an abbreviation, B, an acronym, or C, an initialism?

32
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,920
Okay, I thought that was going to be easy,

33
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,959
but I think it's an abbreviation, isn't it?

34
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,400
Well, you'll have to wait until the end of the program to find out.

35
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,400
Sabrina Hopper is a researcher at the University of Stuttgart.

36
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,400
She was interviewed on the BBC Radio program all in the mind.

37
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,000
She spoke about an experiment in which they tracked the eye movements

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,239
of people in real situations.

39
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,719
This is what she said about the research.

40
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,400
Was she confident the experiment would work in the real world?

41
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,360
The main finding in our study is that it's possible at all

42
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,680
to just look at eye movements and then predict something about their personality.

43
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,159
And before our study, it was not clear at all

44
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,240
if this would be possible from eye movements

45
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,400
in such an unconstrained real-world setting.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,560
So, was she confident this would work?

47
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,680
No, not really.

48
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,479
She said that before the study, it wasn't clear

49
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,080
if it would be possible in an unconstrained real-world setting.

50
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,000
Unconstrained here means that there wasn't strict control

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,319
over the conditions of the experiment.

52
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,080
It took place in the real world, so not in a laboratory.

53
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,280
The result of the experiment or the finding, as she called it,

54
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
was that by following eye movements,

55
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,759
a computer program was able to work out the personality of the subjects.

56
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,640
Let's listen again.

57
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:57,039
The main finding in our study is that it's possible at all

58
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,359
to just look at eye movements and then predict something about their personality.

59
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:03,839
And before our study, it was not clear at all

60
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:05,919
if this would be possible from eye movements

61
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,079
in such an unconstrained real-world setting.

62
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,119
So how does the software work, for example?

63
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:15,919
What are the differences in the eye movements of extroverts compared to introverts?

64
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,839
We still don't really know in detail what makes the difference.

65
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,039
We can only tell that there are differences and that we know

66
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,000
computer programs that can pick up those differences.

67
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,879
Maybe extrovert people look up a lot because they want to look at people's faces,

68
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,120
whereas some super introvert person maybe just dares at their own shoes

69
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,439
if you want to take the extreme examples.

70
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,080
So probably it somehow changes case,

71
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,560
but we only know that this information is there

72
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,599
and somehow our program figured out how to extract it.

73
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,319
So how does it work?

74
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,400
Well, that's the strange thing.

75
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,319
She said that she didn't really know, at least not in detail.

76
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,759
She did say that our personality somehow changes gaze.

77
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,799
Gaze is another word for looking at something.

78
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,280
So maybe we gaze in different ways,

79
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,280
depending on our personality.

80
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,199
Extroverts may look up more,

81
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:10,159
and introverts like me may look down more.

82
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,639
Yes, it was interesting that she said that she didn't know how it did it,

83
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,439
but the program somehow managed to figure it out.

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,159
The phrase will verb to figure something out

85
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,079
means to understand or realize something.

86
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Time to review today's vocabulary.

87
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,599
But first, let's have the answer to the quiz question.

88
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:31,039
I asked, what are the letters A-I?

89
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:37,039
Are they A and abbreviation B and acronym C and initialism?

90
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:38,319
Rob, what did you say?

91
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,719
I said A and abbreviation.

92
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:42,240
Well, sorry, no.

93
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,560
A-I is C, so to speak.

94
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,400
It's an initialism.

95
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,360
It's the first letters of the words artificial intelligence,

96
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,120
but it's not pronounced like a new word, just the initial letters.

97
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,199
Right, time now to review today's vocabulary.

98
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,600
Yes, we had the word extrovert.

99
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,280
This describes someone who has a very outgoing personality.

100
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,480
An extrovert is confident and socially comfortable.

101
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,439
By contrast, an introvert is someone who is shy

102
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,839
and not comfortable in social situations

103
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:14,240
and doesn't like being the center of attention.

104
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,399
Our report today talked about the findings of some new research.

105
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,639
A finding is something that has been learned,

106
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,720
discovered, or indeed found out.

107
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,120
It is the conclusion that is reached.

108
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,240
Then we had unconstrained to describe the experiment

109
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,120
which was not carried out in a controlled environment.

110
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,040
So unconstrained means not limited or restricted.

111
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,720
Our next word was gaze.

112
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,080
This is a word that means our way of looking at something.

113
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,080
Yes, the findings of the research

114
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,280
suggest that our personality can affect our gaze.

115
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,640
And this was something the computer was able to figure out.

116
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,120
To figure out means to study something

117
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,320
and reach an answer to a particular question or problem.

118
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,720
Right, well, you know what I've just figured out.

119
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,840
Uh-huh, do tell.

120
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,200
It's time to bring this edition of 6 Minute English to an end.

121
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,560
We hope you can join us again,

122
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,360
but until then we are BBCLearningEnglish.com

123
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,960
and you can find us on social media, online and on our app.

124
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,240
Bye for now. Bye-bye.
