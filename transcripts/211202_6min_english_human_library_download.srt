Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,400
And I'm Sam.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,280
If you browse through a library, you'll find a variety of different books from fiction to crime to romance.

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,679
And if you walk through a city, you'll see a variety of people of different ages,

8
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,960
body shapes, skin colours and genders.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,880
In this 6 Minute English, we'll be hearing about an unusual library where the books are people

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,320
made of flesh and bone instead of paper. It's called the human library and the books

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,719
are individuals who have faced prejudice, which means an unreasonable dislike of certain types of people.

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,799
Readers may borrow these books who are people from all walks of life for a 30-minute conversation.

13
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:02,320
The book titles are short and to the point.

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,759
Titles like Transgender, Former Criminal or Immigrant.

15
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:12,960
The human books are volunteers and visiting readers are encouraged to ask those awkward or

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,599
embarrassing questions they've always wondered about.

17
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,159
This means the human library needs to be a safe space.

18
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,400
A place where people feel protected from danger and harm.

19
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,280
It's a fascinating idea, but before we find out more, I have a question for you, Sam.

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,640
The human library started out in Denmark, but soon spread across Europe and the world.

21
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,920
So how many countries have a human library now?

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,519
Is it A, 75, B, 85 or C, 95?

23
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:48,960
Well, everyone likes to hear a story, so I'll guess C, 95.

24
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,239
Okay, Sam, we'll find out if that's right later in the program.

25
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:57,359
The first human library was founded in Copenhagen by Ronnie A. Bagel.

26
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,879
Here he is telling BBC World Service Program People Fixing the World about the

27
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,280
inspiration behind his original idea.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,959
We don't have time on the street to stop and get to know everyone,

29
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,879
so we drop people in little boxes.

30
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,039
So it's instinct that's guiding us and we never get beyond the instinct if we don't get to know

31
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:22,319
the person. So in our library, we recommend sitting down and meeting some of the people that you

32
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,479
normally might actually not feel interested in sitting down with because there's something about

33
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:34,399
them that you may feel a little bit uncomfortable about. You'll learn tremendously not only about them,

34
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:35,599
but also about yourself.

35
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:42,799
When we meet someone new, we often already have ideas about what they are like.

36
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:49,520
Ronnie says we put someone in a box, an expression meaning to judge what kind of person someone is

37
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,600
based on their appearance or on a limited understanding of who they are.

38
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,240
He recommends meeting people who you wouldn't usually spend time with,

39
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:04,560
even if this makes you feel uncomfortable, feel slightly worried or embarrassed in a social situation.

40
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,560
So the main idea of the human library is to challenge the assumptions and stereotypes

41
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,640
that we all have about other people.

42
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,560
Ronnie uses social media to find volunteers who are willing to talk about their lives at public

43
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,719
meetings, which anyone can attend. As the human library spreads around the world, more money is

44
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:30,080
needed to keep the project going. This mostly comes from hosting events for private companies,

45
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,560
including famous businesses like Google. Transgender volunteer Katie John Went is a regular host

46
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,080
for the human libraries business events. Listen to this clip of her introducing the project to a

47
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,960
group of Dutch businessmen from BBC World Service Programme, People Fixing the World.

48
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,480
When we're in the workplace or on social media, what we often find is we're walking on eggshells

49
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,640
around diversity and difference. Many people don't want to get it wrong quite understandably.

50
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,400
The important thing to remember is that you can ask the men a thing. They're never going to make

51
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,400
you wrong for the question you asked today, which is an incredibly rare offer.

52
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,000
When meeting someone with completely different life experiences, people can be worried about saying

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,759
the wrong thing or asking embarrassing questions. Katie says they are walking on eggshells,

54
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,800
an expression which means to be very careful about what you do and say because you don't want to

55
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:34,000
offend or upset anyone. But in fact, the human books are rarely offended. The event is all about

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,759
celebrating people's difference and diversity. A term which describes how many different types of

57
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:46,560
people are included together. Exactly. It's a celebration for everyone regardless of race, age,

58
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,319
or gender. Or nationality in that reminds me what was the answer to your question Neil?

59
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,959
Oh yes, I asked how many countries today have a human library. What did you say Sam?

60
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:04,239
I guessed it was C, 95 countries. Which was the wrong answer I'm afraid. The correct answer was

61
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:11,439
B, 85 countries from Norway and Hungary all the way to Australia and Mongolia. Wow, I met that makes

62
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:18,319
a lot of interesting stories. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary for this programme about people sharing

63
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:24,560
their experience of facing prejudice. The unreasonable dislike are certain groups of people.

64
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:32,000
A safe space is a place where you feel protected from danger and harm. When we put someone in a box,

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,160
we judge them based on their appearance or a limited understanding of them. If you feel uncomfortable,

66
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:44,720
you feel slightly worried or embarrassed in a social situation. The expression walking on eggshells

67
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,480
means being very careful about what you do and say because you don't want to offend anyone.

68
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:56,800
And finally diversity is a term describing many different types of people being included together.

69
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,879
Well, it's time to return these human books back to the library shells because our six minutes are up.
