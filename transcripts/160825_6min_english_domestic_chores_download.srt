00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,040
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,919
I'm Neil.

7
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,359
Neil, how often do you do the washing up at home?

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,359
Oh, you know on special occasions, like after Christmas lunch.

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,960
That's terrible, Neil.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,440
Well, domestic chores are the subject of today's show and you know what?

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,880
I'm not very good at them.

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,760
Hmm.

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,160
Domestic means to do with a family or home and a chore is a boring job that needs doing.

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,240
Not being good at chores sounds like a bad excuse for a voiding housework, Neil.

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,920
I suppose you're right, but I wasn't surprised to learn that an average

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,240
women spend several more hours a day doing chores at home than men.

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,840
Maybe men have a higher threshold for dirt and untidyness.

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,159
Hmm, do you have a high threshold, Neil?

19
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,799
Yes. And threshold means the point at which you begin to feel something.

20
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,200
It takes a lot of dirt and untidyness to make me feel I need to start clearing up.

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:12,159
Okay. So my question for you today, Neil, is what percentage of men take responsibility

22
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,959
for giving the house a weekly clean, according to a recent online survey by UK

23
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:26,799
organisation Mum's Net? Is it a 1%, b 5% or c 10%?

24
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:34,239
Hmm. Those figures all sound low, but I'll assume that not all men are like me and say c 10%.

25
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,959
Well, we'll see if you're being optimistic with your answer later on in the show.

26
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:45,599
So now let's listen to a conversation between BBC reporter Jeff Bird and his wife Sarah

27
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:52,000
in an interview to a BBC presenter they discuss Sarah's a version to or strongest like of domestic

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,479
chores. I think it's a boring thing. You should just do the minimum amount you need to do to get

29
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,399
by. That is my policy. And I'd say I definitely work hard for new to and therefore have less time.

30
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,159
And we just switch stround in terms of our roles. Probably, yeah. And that's no bad thing. Go

31
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:16,879
to the revolution. Sarah and Jeff there in their household, Jeff does more chores because Sarah

32
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,639
finds them boring and she also does more paid work. She thinks people should do the minimum amount

33
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:29,199
of housework or at least amount needed to get by. And to get by means to achieve something with

34
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:34,240
difficulty. So Jeff does most of the cooking and cleaning in their house, which as we discussed

35
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,360
earlier on isn't usually the case for men. He doesn't seem to mind though does he?

36
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,280
Well, no, that's right. He says switching roles is no bad thing. In other words, it's a good thing.

37
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,200
Yeah, go the revolution. Just don't include me because I'm with Sarah. I hate housework.

38
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,360
Okay, well, let's assume that Sarah and Jeff aren't typical of most families and consider

39
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,560
the serious implications of women doing more of the household chores. Some domestic tasks can

40
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,800
be strongly gendered or specific to one sex. For example, doing the laundry, organizing your

41
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,000
children's school and social lives are often jobs that women do. But putting the rubbish out or

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,520
fixing a leaky tap, those are what many people still see as men's jobs. Well, I put the rubbish

43
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:28,159
bins out in my house, Alpnil. Anyway, this means women often spend significantly more time doing chores

44
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,199
at home, juggling this with paid work. Yes, that sounds like a lot. I can see I'm going to have to

45
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:38,479
get my penny on a bit more at home, Aless. I hope you do, Neil, because a bit more give and take at

46
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:43,120
home could help improve a working month's prospects of getting promoted at work and earning more.

47
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,599
And for those of you unfamiliar with the word penny or pinnifor means apron. And give and take

48
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:55,359
means compromise. Let's hear now from Professor Jonathan Gershney, co-director at the Centre for

49
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,800
Time Use Research at Oxford University, talking about why it's important to protect your earning

50
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:14,960
capacity or ability to earn money. Nowadays, half of all marriages fail. It's not a reasonable

51
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:21,520
expectation that you're going to stay married for the same chap indefinitely. And if under these

52
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,079
circumstances you've been out of the labour force looking after the kids while he builds up his

53
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:34,159
earnings capacity by working long hours at work and then he runs off with his secretary,

54
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,680
well, he departs with the earnings power and you're left with the baby.

55
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,359
Professor Jonathan Gershney, but actually these days quite a few men take care of the children

56
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:52,319
while their wives or partners work full time. And she might run off with her secretary.

57
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,680
But the main issue here is that both partners, whether male or female, should protect their

58
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,520
earnings capacity. Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question, Neil.

59
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,280
I asked you, what percentage of men take responsibility for giving the house a weekly clean,

60
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,080
according to a recent online survey by the UK organisation Mum's Net? Is it a 1%

61
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:24,719
b, 5% or c, 10%? And I said c, 10%. And you were wrong, I'm afraid, Neil.

62
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:31,199
The answer is actually b, 5%. Mum's Net asked nearly a thousand working mothers about the

63
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,079
distribution of tasks in their homes. Now, can we hear the words we learned today, please?

64
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:49,919
Sure, they are. Sure. Threshold. Aversion. Minimum. No bad thing.

65
00:05:52,319 --> 00:06:02,959
Gendard. Pity or pinnacle. Given take. Earning capacity.

66
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:08,959
Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. Don't forget to join us again soon.

67
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,959
Bye bye.
