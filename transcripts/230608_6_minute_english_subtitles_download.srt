00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,919
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:13,200
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,400
If your deaf or hard of hearing, watching television would be impossible without subtitles.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,839
The words of dialogue added at the bottom of the screen,

6
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,879
explaining what the characters are saying.

7
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:30,000
Subtitled captions aren't only for dialogue.

8
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:37,200
In the most dramatic action-packed scenes of a movie, there might be no one speaking,

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,320
but there are plenty of sounds. A scream, a thrilling car chase,

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,079
and all these sounds need to be described as well.

11
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,439
In this programme we'll be meeting Carly Vitovska, a subtitle who works on the

12
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:58,479
stranger things show to find out more. And of course, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

13
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:00,959
But first, I have a question for you, Neil.

14
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:10,000
Movie subtitles are written ahead of time, but subtitling for live TV has to be done in the moment.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,519
As the person is speaking, this can lead to mistakes, sometimes very funny ones,

16
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:22,159
including a subtitle which appeared in an interview for the BBC 6 o'clock news in 2019.

17
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:30,319
But what did the subtitle say? Was it A, we can't allow Spider-Man to become Prime Minister,

18
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,079
B, we can't allow Superman to become Prime Minister,

19
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,039
or C, we can't allow Batman to become Prime Minister.

20
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:43,199
Hmm, I guess the subtitling mistake involved Spider-Man?

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,320
I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

22
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,040
Of course, it's not just deaf audiences that subtitles help.

23
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,799
The translated subtitles of foreign films are great for learning languages,

24
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,040
letting you read a word and hear how it's pronounced at the same time.

25
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,520
And because subtitles describe everything from monster squelches to bombs exploding,

26
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,879
it's a great way to learn new adjectives.

27
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:17,680
Here's subtitler, Carli Vittowska, explaining to BBC Radio 4 programme Word of Mouse,

28
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,280
how her choice of adjective creates emotion for the viewer.

29
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,159
It depends on the genre and depends on the shows.

30
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:31,039
And so if you have a very upbeat sort of period piece where the music is very

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,479
jauntay, like you would use the word jauntay to describe the music,

32
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:43,759
it's just, it's creating an idea of what a sound is like and using a very, very descriptive

33
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,519
word in order to do so.

34
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:52,479
Carli bases her descriptions on the film's genre, a style of film, music or book with its own

35
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:58,159
particular set of features. The sound effects needed for a thriller like Stranger Things,

36
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,520
Creeking Stairs and Sudden Screams are very different from the sounds used in historical

37
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,159
period dramas, which are more upbeat, light-hearted and cheerful.

38
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,039
This influences the adjective Carli chooses to describe a sound.

39
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:20,000
For example, upbeat music might be described as jauntay, full of energy and confidence.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,560
Subtitles started out as an accessibility feature for deaf audiences and to translate foreign

41
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:33,120
language films into English. But since the growth of online streaming services like Netflix,

42
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,080
subtitling has become something of an art.

43
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,000
Carli belongs to a team of subtitlers who try to make their descriptions as close as possible

44
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,360
to the sounds they hear. Here she tells BBC Radio 4's Word of Mouth about a time her team found

45
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,360
exactly the right word.

46
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,320
I loved gobsmacked silence because you were able to tell that people were like almost on the

47
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:05,280
verge of a gasp or on the verge of like a shock and that was the atmosphere. But there wasn't actually

48
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,360
a sound. So when my colleague came up with that one, I definitely wanted to give him a virtual high five.

49
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,639
In this scene, the surprise characters were about to gasp, taking a short quick breath of air.

50
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,159
There was no speech or sound in the scene, but Carli's team found the perfect adjective to

51
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:31,039
describe the silence. Gobsmacked, which is slang for being so surprised you can't speak.

52
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:37,759
This was definitely one description that deserved a high five, lifting up your hand to clap hands

53
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:45,839
with someone else as a greeting or to say well done. In fact, the phrase gobsmacked silence was so good

54
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,639
it went viral and started being used in all kinds of situations.

55
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,639
Maybe gobsmacked was how the viewers of that TV news programme felt. You know, the mistaken

56
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,919
subtitle you asked me about in your question. I guess the incorrect subtitle was we can't allow

57
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:11,199
Spider-Man to become Prime Minister. Which was the wrong answer I'm afraid. In fact, the interview

58
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:18,240
he said we can't allow that man to become Prime Minister. Speaking about Boris Johnson,

59
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,800
but the misheard subtitle appeared as Batman. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt

60
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,919
from this programme on subtitles, starting with genre. A style of film, music or book with its

61
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,959
own particular set of characteristics. Something which is upbeat is cheerful, hopeful and lighthearted.

62
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:45,519
The adjective jaunty means full of energy and confidence. If you gasp, you take in a short,

63
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:52,479
quick breath of air in surprise or in pain. You can use the slang expression gobsmacked when someone

64
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:59,279
is so surprised they can't speak. And finally, if you give someone a high five, you hold up your hand

65
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:05,120
above your head, clapping hands with somebody else as a greeting or to say well done. Once again,

66
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:13,199
our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now. Bye.
