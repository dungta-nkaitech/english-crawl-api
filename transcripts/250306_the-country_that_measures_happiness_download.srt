00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,320
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,879
And I'm Pippa. In this programme we're talking about happiness. So what makes you happy, Neil?

4
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:24,800
Oh, it makes me happy when I'm with a group of old friends and we're having a good laugh.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,240
How about you, Pippa?

6
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:32,960
Cats make me very happy, especially if I see a cat on the street that I don't know and it lets me

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,759
give it a little stroke that always makes me happy.

8
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:37,519
I'm not surprised. That sounds great.

9
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:43,200
So, happiness means different things to different people, but what's for sure is that most people

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,159
would like to be happy. And the small Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan has taken this to a new level

11
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,959
with the idea of gross national happiness or GNH.

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,560
We'll be hearing more about gross national happiness and learning some useful new vocabulary soon.

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:06,000
But first Pippa, I have a question for you. Of course, it's not just the people of Bhutan who

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,079
want to be happy. In fact, the United Nations has even announced an international day of happiness.

15
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:21,840
But when is that? Is international happiness day A the 20th of March B the 20th of June or C the 20th

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,079
of November? I'm going to say the 20th of June because it would be sunny in the UK.

17
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,439
Okay, let's find out if you're right at the end of the programme.

18
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,719
Now, briefly, gross national happiness means preserving Bhutan's natural environment and culture

19
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:44,159
through sustainable and eco-friendly development. Bhutan's government sees these goals

20
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,520
as more important than growing the economy at any cost.

21
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,159
For many years Bhutan was closed to the outside world. The first foreign tourists arrived

22
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:02,159
in 1974 and television was only introduced in 1999. The King of Bhutan wanted to modernise the

23
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,840
country and give it the benefits of modern technology but without damaging traditional culture.

24
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,680
So he invited outside experts to develop the idea of gross national happiness.

25
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:20,879
One expert was Dr. Harvinto speaking here to Charmaine Cosia, presenter of BBC World Service

26
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:29,360
programme The Inquiry. So his idea was how could we modernise and open our country without losing

27
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,560
its culture, its environment and its very strong social fabric because Bhutan was one of the

28
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,920
only countries in Asia who has never colonised therefore its culture is very intact and vibrant,

29
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:48,639
mainly Buddhist culture. And so the idea was that gross national happiness should be the focus

30
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:55,119
on all governmental decisions and policies. So the well-being and happiness of citizens

31
00:02:55,119 --> 00:03:01,119
took them to stage Bhutan has a strong social fabric meaning there are good

32
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:07,519
relationships within communities and these hold society together. Unlike other Asian countries,

33
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,480
Bhutan was never colonised so its Buddhist culture and traditions are intact,

34
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,840
they're complete and unspoiled. As a result the happiness of Bhutan's people

35
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,000
took centre stage it became the most important thing. Bhutan's emphasis on happiness has been

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,560
admired around the world but there have been problems too. One is the migration of Bhutanese workers

37
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,320
to India and other countries in search of better paid jobs and opportunities, something known as

38
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:43,599
the brain drain. So in 2023 the King of Bhutan announced a multi-million dollar project called

39
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,840
the Mindfulness City, a new Himalayan city built on spiritual and environmental principles

40
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,000
all powered by renewable energy. Originally from Bhutan, Dr. Laoang Uguel is the

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,599
project's director and spoke with Charme Enkosia for the BBC World Services, the Inquiry.

42
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,599
The project is also about reversing Bhutan's brain drain. The intention is to have locals

43
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:16,560
run this whole Mindfulness City so in that sense it's also to attract the migrants that have left

44
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:24,079
and in the process of having worked abroad gain the extra skills come back to the Mindfulness City

45
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:31,519
and work. As well as being a futuristic eco city, the Mindfulness City hopes to stop Bhutan's

46
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,159
brain drain by attracting workers back home to Bhutan. These local workers can then use the extra

47
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:42,639
skills that they've learned abroad through upskilling and upskilling is the process where

48
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,599
worker skills are improved through training. The idea of gross national happiness might sound

49
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:52,959
unusual but it's interesting to see Bhutan balancing economic growth with the happiness of its

50
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:59,680
people. Yes that's true and it reminds me of your question now. Yes I asked you what the date

51
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,840
of International Happiness Day is. I said it was the 20th of June in the summer in the UK.

52
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Well maybe it's better for people in the Southern Hemisphere because it's actually the 20th of

53
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,639
March. Ah nice. And if you got that answer right why not try our interactive quiz which you'll

54
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:25,199
find on our website bbclearningenglish.com. Okay let's recap the vocabulary we've learned

55
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:30,879
starting with modernise to make something more modern for example through introducing technology.

56
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,879
Our country's social fabric means the relationships which connect a community together.

57
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:43,439
The adjective intact means complete and undamaged. If something takes center stage it becomes

58
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:49,439
more important than anything else. A brain drain happens when large numbers of educated and skilled

59
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,879
people leave their own country to live and work in another country where they can earn more money.

60
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:00,480
And finally up-skilling means improving worker skills through training and experience.

61
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,000
Once again our six minutes are up goodbye for now. Goodbye.
