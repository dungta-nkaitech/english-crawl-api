Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,240
And I'm Sam.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,199
When you were a teenager, did your parents worry that you were watching too much television, Sam?

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,280
They used to tell me that watching too much TV would turn my eye square.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,320
But they were only joking.

8
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,560
I don't think it's all bad news, Neil.

9
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,240
In fact, in this programme, we'll be taking a look at a new report,

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,000
which finds little evidence to link technology with mental health problems in adolescence.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,480
That's young people who are in the process of developing from children into adults.

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,280
I'm not convinced, Sam.

13
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,960
Think about how much time youngsters spend staring at screens every day.

14
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,480
True, but unlike passively watching television,

15
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,760
today's technology is interactive, connecting teenagers to their friends around the world.

16
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,439
Well, maybe my quiz question will change your mind.

17
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,079
Are you ready?

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,759
On average, how many hours per day do British teenagers spend on their screens?

19
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:38,560
Is it a, five and a half hours, b, six and a half hours, or c, seven and a half hours?

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,560
I'll say it's b, six and a half hours.

21
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,640
That sounds a lot to me.

22
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,479
Well, whatever Neil thinks, a new study from the Oxford Internet Institute,

23
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,000
paints a more hopeful picture.

24
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,439
The study analysed data from over 400,000 British and American teenagers

25
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,120
and found little or no link between adolescence tech use and mental health problems.

26
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:10,560
Listen to Gareth Mitchell and Gillen Boddington, co-presenters of BBC World Services Digital Planet,

27
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,639
as they discuss the report's findings.

28
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,920
Gillen Boddington, you've been looking at some of the findings yourself.

29
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,479
Haven't you?

30
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,479
So, what's your response so far?

31
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,319
Were you expecting, Gillen, to see some kind of smoking guns, some kind of link that would say,

32
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,759
here we are, here are the harms.

33
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,679
Not really, because I think we're at a point where teenagers are much more savvy than many adults think.

34
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:33,199
So, you know, we are at risk.

35
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,479
All of us as journalists and research community to assume, maybe,

36
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,239
this is much more terrible problem than we understand.

37
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,879
Because if I know the teenagers around me,

38
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,159
and one thing that they do all have is app lockers on their sites,

39
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,359
and they are actually quite aware of the addiction problems,

40
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,280
the design, you know, design for addiction.

41
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,040
Many people assume that social media harms teenagers,

42
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,400
so Gareth asked Gillen whether she was expecting to find a smoking gun in the report.

43
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,800
The expression a smoking gun means evidence that proves something is true.

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,040
For example, evidence proving that technology is harmful to young people.

45
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,080
But Gillen doesn't think this is true.

46
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,880
Actually, she calls teenagers savvy,

47
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,760
meaning that they have practical knowledge of technology

48
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,920
and a good understanding of how to use it.

49
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,640
One example of teenagers being technologically savvy is their use of app blockers,

50
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,560
software that prevents unwanted apps and websites from popping up

51
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,920
and allows users to set timers, which limit screen time.

52
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,320
And reducing screen time is important because nowadays,

53
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,400
most video games in social media are designed for addiction,

54
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,680
intended to manipulate human psychology to make the user once a keep playing.

55
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,000
But it seems that today's adolescents are savvy enough to know how to use

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,239
electronic devices sensibly.

57
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,000
How else can we explain the fact that, according to this research,

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,240
there's no clear link between using tech and mental health problems?

59
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes, that's certainly the view of the research team leader,

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,520
Dr. Mati Vore.

61
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,680
Here he is speaking with BBC World Service Programme Digital Planet

62
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,639
about an interesting and very modern term.

63
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,600
See if you can hear it.

64
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,839
We often hear the term digital native.

65
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,439
You know, you grow up with a device in your hand almost.

66
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,319
And then it's not a surprise that you are skilled in using those technologies to your benefit.

67
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,560
Did you hear the expression, Dr. Vore used Sam?

68
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,040
Yes, he called teenagers digital natives,

69
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,639
meaning someone who is very familiar and comfortable using computers and digital technology

70
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,079
because they've grown up with them.

71
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,360
So maybe there are benefits to spending hours looking at screens after all.

72
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,480
In my quiz question, I asked Sam about the average daily screen time for British teenagers.

73
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,920
I said it was B six and a half hours.

74
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,879
Which was the correct answer, very savvy of you, Sam.

75
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:13,040
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from this program about the impact of tech on adolescence.

76
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,519
That's young people who are developing into adults.

77
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:22,240
Today's adolescence are digital natives, people who are very familiar with digital technology

78
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,680
because they've grown up with it.

79
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,719
If you are savvy, you have a good practical understanding of something.

80
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,040
A smoking gun refers to information or evidence that proves that something is true.

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,680
An app blocker is software that blocks pop-up apps and websites and allows users to set

82
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,320
screen time limits. And designed for addiction describes immersive video games and social media,

83
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,520
which are designed to manipulate human psychology and make it hard to stop playing.

84
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,759
That's all for this program, but if you're interested in the issues around digital technology and

85
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,959
want to find out more, then why not visit the BBC Digital Planet website or follow them on

86
