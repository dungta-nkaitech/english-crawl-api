00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,320
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Sophie.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,080
And I'm Neil. I was watching the news the other day Sophie.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,679
Learn anything interesting?

8
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:26,240
Yes actually. UK scientists have been authorised by the government

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,920
to genetically modify human embryos for research.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,800
What they can't do though is implant modified embryos into women.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,960
They talked a lot about gene editing.

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,280
Can you explain to us what gene editing is?

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,840
Um, I think this means there are these letters in a code,

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,840
A, B, C, something. I can't remember exactly.

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,960
Gene editing is the ability to manipulate or control DNA.

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,480
And in case you didn't know, DNA is short for

17
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,959
Deoxyribonuclic Acid.

18
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:02,000
This is a substance in the cells of animals and plants

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,239
that contains genetic information.

20
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,759
And a gene is part of the DNA in the cell that controls

21
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:11,200
the physical development and behaviour of a plant

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,479
or animal and is passed on from its parents.

23
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,120
Phew, thanks for the science lesson Sophie.

24
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,000
You're welcome.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,920
Now here's a question for you.

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,519
Which science fiction film anticipates gene editing

27
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,079
in a dystopian society where humans are genetically engineered?

28
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:30,719
Is it a Robocop?

29
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,159
B, Gatica or C, Blade Runner?

30
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,560
Hmm, I don't really understand the question,

31
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,840
but I'm going to say C, Blade Runner.

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,959
What's dystopian?

33
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,000
Dystopian means an imaginary society

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,640
where people aren't happy and afraid.

35
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,319
Well, moving on, let's listen to BBC Journalist

36
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,559
Fergus Walsh talking about how gene editing works.

37
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:58,079
Think of gene editing as a molecular satnav.

38
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,959
It scans the DNA searching for the error.

39
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,199
Then it uses molecular scissors to snip through both strands

40
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:07,439
which switches off the faulty gene.

41
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,719
Or it can repair the code by inserting a healthy copy of the gene.

42
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,599
These techniques raise the prospect of treating

43
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,400
even curing some genetic diseases.

44
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,079
And it's not science fiction.

45
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,120
So DNA is a set of instructions for how our bodies work.

46
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,639
Written using a chemical code of four letters,

47
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,519
A, T, C, G.

48
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,919
But sometimes the code contains mistakes.

49
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,799
Yes, you find spelling mistakes by scanning

50
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:38,799
or searching through the DNA.

51
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:41,599
Then you snip or cut out the mistake

52
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,919
or faulty gene from the code using molecular scissors.

53
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,120
Faulty, by the way, means something that isn't working properly.

54
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
Like the faulty breaks on my bike.

55
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
That sounds really dangerous, Neil.

56
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,000
Yeah, but I'm more worried about my faulty genes.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,680
I might have all sorts of genetic mistakes inside me.

58
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,439
That wouldn't surprise me.

59
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,080
But you've actually touched on a serious point.

60
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,400
Latest research suggests all our bodies

61
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,560
do contain genetic mistakes,

62
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,879
some of which could cause disease.

63
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,159
And as reporter Fergus Walsh said at the end of the clip,

64
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,960
gene editing could be important for treating

65
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,560
or even curing inherited genetic diseases.

66
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,800
For patients with blood, immune, muscle or skin disorders,

67
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,520
it offers the possibility that their faulty cells

68
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,920
could be removed or changed in the lab and then put back.

69
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,200
That does sound amazing, but is there a catch?

70
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,240
And that means a problem or drawback.

71
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,760
Yes, some people think that if editing the genes

72
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,719
of a human embryo is allowed for curing disease,

73
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,599
this will lead to editing the genes of embryos

74
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,000
for reasons other than health.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,240
Let's listen to Marcy Dinovsky,

76
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,039
Executive Director of the Center for Genetics

77
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:57,199
and Society in California,

78
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,120
talking about her concerns.

79
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:01,120
It's too risky.

80
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,000
We don't need it.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,159
There are other ways to have healthy children.

82
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,319
And it would open the door, possibly,

83
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,120
to a world of genetic calves and have knots.

84
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,639
We don't need more inequality.

85
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,639
We don't need more discrimination in the world.

86
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,479
An embryo, by the way, is an animal or human

87
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,120
starting to develop inside its mother.

88
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,839
Marcy Dinovsky is against gene editing

89
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,959
because it may be used to create designer babies

90
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,439
or babies whose genes have been selected

91
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,240
to have certain desirable characteristics.

92
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,399
She says it may open the door or make it possible,

93
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,479
a situation where embryos are genetically enhanced

94
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,959
or improved to be more intelligent

95
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,519
or physically stronger, for example.

96
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,239
And this will lead to more discrimination in the world,

97
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:49,439
which means treating some people less fairly than others.

98
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,359
Which is something that science fiction

99
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:53,519
has been predicting for many years.

100
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,519
It's that dystopian society we were discussing earlier, Neil.

101
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,159
Which science-fiction film anticipates

102
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:02,959
gene editing in a dystopian society

103
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,839
where humans are genetically engineered?

104
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,519
Is it a Robocop, B, Gatica,

105
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,519
or C, Blade Runner?

106
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,159
And I said C, Blade Runner.

107
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:15,680
Sorry, Neil.

108
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,919
It was B, Gatica.

109
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,319
This 1997 sci-fi film

110
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,799
centers on the character Vincent Freeman,

111
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:24,959
who wasn't genetically engineered,

112
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,439
but is able to buy the genetic identity of another man

113
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,359
in order to pursue his dream of traveling into space.

114
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:36,319
The film's title uses the letters

115
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,719
G, A, T, and C, which are the four chemical codes

116
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:42,959
making up DNA.

117
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,199
Now, here are today's words, gene editing.

118
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:54,399
Manipulate, DNA, gene dystopian, scanning,

119
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,439
snip, faulty, catch embryo.

120
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,480
Designer babies, open the door,

121
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,360
enhanced discrimination.

122
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,600
Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

123
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,280
Please do join us again soon.

124
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,840
Goodbye.

125
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,280
Bye-bye.
