Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,320
And I'm Sam.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,120
Last weekend I was driving from London to Anglesian Wales

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,320
when I saw a road sign written in two languages.

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,519
It said, welcome to Wales in English.

8
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,679
And below that, it said,

9
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,119
Kroiso Gumri in Welsh.

10
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,079
Yes, Welsh is spoken by many people in North Wales.

11
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,840
It's the indigenous language.

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,119
The language spoken by the people who originally lived in a place,

13
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:45,920
rather than by others, who moved there from somewhere else.

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,120
Welsh is a good example of an indigenous language that has survived.

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,039
Some children speak Welsh in school

16
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,679
and the local government has encouraged its spread,

17
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,760
but not all indigenous languages have been so lucky

18
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,079
as we'll be finding out in this programme.

19
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,519
Of course, languages are more than just words.

20
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:07,679
They carry people's history, culture and identity.

21
00:01:07,679 --> 00:01:10,759
So when an indigenous language disappears,

22
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:13,079
so too does the culture.

23
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:15,680
Yes, the dominance of international languages,

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,879
including English, has endangered other less spoken languages.

25
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,039
So here's my quiz question, Sam.

26
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:26,479
Did you know that nearly 7,000 different languages are spoken around the world,

27
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,960
but how many of them are indigenous?

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,719
Is it A, 3,000, B, 4,000 or C, 5,000?

29
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,400
Hmm, I'll say B, 4,000 languages.

30
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,240
Okay, Sam, we'll find out the answer at the end of the programme.

31
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,960
One indigenous language speaker is Michko Gabwyd Kwe.

32
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,640
She's from Canada or Turtle Island, as it's called by her tribe.

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,159
She grew up speaking English instead of her native language,

34
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,159
Anishi Nabe Mowin, which she only learned later as an adult.

35
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,439
Listen to Michko Gabwyd speaking with BBC World Service programme,

36
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,840
the conversation about how she felt learning

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,359
Anishi Nabe Mowin later in life.

38
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:13,199
When I realised that the sounds that were coming out of my mouth

39
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,199
were the same sounds that had come out of my ancestors' mouth

40
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:21,280
thousands of years ago, I felt a deep sense of who I was

41
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,560
and what it means to be anishonabic.

42
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,360
And it made me realise that my dream of learning this language

43
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,520
and passing it on to my children was now accessible,

44
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,920
was now reachable, attainable.

45
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,080
And after a couple of months, I was able to understand one full prayer

46
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,960
that was said at a ceremony feast.

47
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,159
And the glee in me and the feeling of joy

48
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:49,400
of being able to understand something in my own language,

49
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,480
it was the most profound sense of confidence.

50
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,560
Learning to speak the language of her ancestors

51
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,159
gave Michko Gabwyd glee a feeling of happiness, pleasure or excitement.

52
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,800
Although she didn't grow up speaking, Anishi Nabe Mowin,

53
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,640
she now wants to pass it on to her children.

54
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,240
To pass something on means to give it to someone,

55
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,360
usually in your family, who lives on after you die.

56
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,840
Michko Gabwyd's decision to raise her children

57
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,680
speaking Anishina Bimoin turned out to be the right one,

58
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,680
as she explained to BBC World Service Program the conversation.

59
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,759
There's lots of bumps in the road, but it's going very well.

60
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:35,520
My daughter is turning four and she completely understands the language.

61
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,080
Being put back into daycare, which she's only been there for maybe a month,

62
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,360
has really influenced her English.

63
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,599
So I noticed she's speaking a lot of English.

64
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:48,239
And so that was a little bit rough for the family,

65
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,319
being an immersion home where we only speak Nishina Bimoin in the home,

66
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,039
for there to be so much English.

67
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:56,639
And only recently over the last week and a half,

68
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,359
have we really noticed her switch and her shift back into using the language?

69
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,719
Bringing up her children to speak her indigenous language wasn't easy.

70
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:08,879
And Michko Gabwyd said there were some bumps in the road,

71
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,439
small problems or delays that slowed down or stopped things from developing.

72
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,360
To help her family spoke only Anishina Bimoin at home,

73
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,079
using a technique called immersion.

74
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,079
The process of learning a language or skill by using only that and nothing else.

75
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,560
This meant that Michko Gabwyd's children spoke both English at school

76
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,199
and Anishina Bimoin at home.

77
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,319
She noticed how they changed between languages when speaking,

78
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,800
something known as code switching.

79
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,120
Michko Gabwyd believes this not only helps her children's development,

80
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,399
but also gives them a sense of family history,

81
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,000
as well as preserving her traditional culture.

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,240
A culture she hopes they will pass on to their children in turn.

83
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,399
So while indigenous cultures are threatened by big global languages,

84
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,840
there still hope that many will survive into the future.

85
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,480
Which reminds me of your quiz question, Neil.

86
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,560
Was my answer right?

87
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,480
Ah yes, I asked Sam how many of the 7,000 languages spoken around the world are indigenous?

88
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,160
And I thought it was B, 4,000 languages.

89
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,400
Which was the correct answer.

90
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,840
And what's amazing is that although indigenous peoples make up

91
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,319
under 6% of the global population,

92
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,000
they speak more than 4,000 of the world's languages.

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,439
Okay, Neil, let's recap the vocabulary from this program on Indigenous Languages.

94
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,520
Languages spoken by the people who originally lived in a place,

95
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,319
rather than others who came later.

96
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,599
Glee is a feeling of happiness or excitement.

97
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:46,719
If you pass something on, you give it to someone,

98
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:50,719
usually in your family, who lives on after you.

99
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:55,199
A bump in the road is a small problem or delay that slows things down.

100
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,759
Immersion is a process of learning something,

101
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,759
like a language or a skill,

102
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,199
by using only that and nothing else.

103
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,639
And finally, code switching is the ability to change between two or more languages when speaking.

104
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:10,639
That's all for Mass. Bye for now.

105
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,639
Bye-bye.
