00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,240
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English,

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,640
the programme where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary.

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,400
I'm Neil. And I'm Catherine.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,920
Now, if you want to fight climate change, what can you do?

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,120
Well, you can use less electricity or stop driving.

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:33,039
But scientists believe there's another behaviour which has an even bigger impact on the planet,

11
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:35,120
and that is what you eat.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,760
We're talking about meat here.

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,039
If people cut out meat and animal products from their diets,

14
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,159
harmful emissions could be reduced by 70%.

15
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,960
That's according to research from Oxford University.

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,920
Now, emissions are the gases produced by an activity or living thing.

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,640
So we could talk about factory emissions or farming emissions.

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,200
And if you eat no meat or animal products, you're what we call vegan.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,920
More and more people around the world are going vegan.

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,200
And today's question, which of these celebrities is vegan?

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,719
Is it A, Brad Pitt, B, Jennifer Lopez or C, Miley Cyrus?

22
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,079
Hmm, and I'm going to go for C, Miley Cyrus.

23
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,719
Well, we'll find out at the end of the programme.

24
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,560
Now, before we go much further, why don't we find out a bit more

25
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,280
about exactly what it means to be a vegan?

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,120
Here's Tom Kuno from the Vegan Society in the UK.

27
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,840
Veganism is a way of living, which excludes as far as possible and practicable

28
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,040
all forms of exploitation and cruelty to animals.

29
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,560
So that's for food, clothing or any other purpose.

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,640
So we just don't want to use or abuse animals.

31
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,560
And we feel like that, you know, there are plenty of alternatives in this day and age.

32
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,799
It's never been easier to be vegan.

33
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,200
Of course, he says that avoiding cruelty to animals is what it's all about,

34
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,359
but that doesn't just mean food.

35
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,120
If you're a true vegan, then clothing from animals is also out.

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,400
No more leather shoes.

37
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,200
Hmm.

38
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,199
But he feels that it's easier than ever before to become vegan.

39
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,439
And he uses a nice phrase in this day and age.

40
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,400
Yes, it means these days or in the present time,

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,400
and is often used to highlight a contrast with a previous time.

42
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,319
So many people go vegan for ethical reasons.

43
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,400
Now, ethical is a useful word.

44
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,360
It means relating to moral beliefs.

45
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,480
So if you become vegan for ethical reasons,

46
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,280
you do it because you think it's wrong to eat or use animal products.

47
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,480
Others go vegan because of environmental considerations,

48
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,000
as we looked at earlier.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,280
Rearing livestock, that means animals like cows and pigs,

50
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,920
produces a lot of harmful methane gas.

51
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:55,599
Now, let's just say the animals themselves produce a lot of it from their bodies.

52
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,239
The other major reason to choose veganism.

53
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,839
Veganism, now that's the noun for a vegan diet,

54
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:03,839
is because they believe it's healthier.

55
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:06,959
In the research from Oxford University we mentioned earlier,

56
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,799
scientists found that 8 million deaths per year could be avoided if the world went vegan.

57
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:14,479
Now, that's human deaths.

58
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,639
They claim that half of this figure would be because we no longer eat red meat,

59
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,639
and the other half would be due to eating more healthy fruit and vegetables,

60
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,039
as well as fewer people being overweight.

61
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,399
And they say that this would have an economic impact too.

62
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:32,479
They suggest that up to a thousand billion dollars a year would be saved

63
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,519
due to reduced healthcare costs and increased productivity at work,

64
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,439
because fewer people would get sick.

65
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,199
So if it's also simple, why don't we all go vegan tomorrow?

66
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,639
Well, meaty thing is an important part of most cultures.

67
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,239
Not everyone wants to change.

68
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,159
And millions of people worldwide raise livestock for a living.

69
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,159
So these jobs would disappear.

70
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,920
Now, with up to a third of the planet estimated to be arid,

71
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,360
which means dry and unable to support crops,

72
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,400
people living in these regions rely on livestock.

73
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,240
So people, for example, like the burbers in the Sahara region.

74
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,600
Without animal farming, they'd be forced to abandon traditional,

75
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,960
nomadic lifestyles.

76
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,560
That's where they move from place to place and settle in cities.

77
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,720
And for many people, well, they're just like eating meat and dairy.

78
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,120
We asked you about well-known vegans, which of these is vegan?

79
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,519
Brad Pitt, Jennifer Lopez, or Miley Cyrus?

80
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,040
And I said it was Miley Cyrus.

81
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,079
Well, you're kind of half-right, Catherine.

82
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,680
In fact, both Brad Pitt and Miley Cyrus are vegan.

83
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,840
Jennifer Lopez used to be, but has since started eating meat again, apparently.

84
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,079
Now, why don't we wrap it by looking at today's vocabulary one more time?

85
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,599
Well, we started with emissions.

86
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:51,279
Gases produced by something or an activity, such as digestion.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Livestock emissions, for example, are gases produced by animals.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,159
We can also add a word that describes the kind of emissions,

89
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:04,399
like methane emissions or greenhouse gas emissions.

90
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,639
Next up, we had in this day and age, which means these days.

91
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,799
I still can't believe you don't have a smartphone in this day and age, Neil.

92
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,480
Well, maybe I just object to smartphones for ethical reasons.

93
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,800
So you've got moral objections to smartphones?

94
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,480
Yeah, for me, it's important to understand the condition of the workers in the factory

95
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,920
where the smartphone is made.

96
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,879
That's fair enough, then.

97
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,560
But, Neil, you haven't become vegan yet for ethical reasons, have you?

98
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,840
You've got me there.

99
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,920
I admire veganism, but I still like cheese too much to do it.

100
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,920
Veganism is the noun.

101
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,879
That's right.

102
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,480
So two more words to go.

103
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,879
We have arid and livestock.

104
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:46,959
Arid describes land that is too dry to support many crops or plants.

105
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,079
But arid regions can sometimes support livestock.

106
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,079
Livestock means farm animals.

107
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,519
If you think of the stock as being the assets of a business,

108
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,319
then animals are living or livestock.

109
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,439
And that brings us to the end of today's programme.

00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,319
Join us on our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages for lots more.

111

Let us know what you think of veganism.

112
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,000
Bye for now.

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,480
Bye.
