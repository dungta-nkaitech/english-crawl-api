00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,359
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,800
And I'm Catherine, hello.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,960
Now, Catherine. Say cheese.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,960
Cheese!

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,240
Ah, thank you, a little souvenir of our time together.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,600
Let's have a look.

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,359
I got a minute, you just took a selfie, I wasn't even in the picture.

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,200
Ah, well, that's the magic of the smartphone, two cameras.

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,719
You know, that's not something you can do with a traditional camera.

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,240
I mean, do you even have a separate camera these days?

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,359
I do, actually. It's in a cupboard somewhere at home.

16
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,480
Well, that is the topic of this programme.

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,320
Have traditional cameras been completely replaced by smartphones?

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,879
Or to put it another way, have cameras been made obsolete by the smartphone?

19
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,320
Interesting question.

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,200
But before we get into this topic, how about a question for our listeners?

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,159
Of course.

22
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:04,879
We are certainly in the digital age of photography,

23
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,640
but when was the first digital camera phone released?

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,799
Was it A2000, B2004 or C2007? What do you think?

25
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,159
Well, I actually know this one, so I'm going to be fair and keep it to myself.

26
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,760
Okay, well, listen out for the answer at the end of the programme.

27
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,480
There are different kinds of cameras available today.

28
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,480
There are compact cameras, which are small and mostly automatic,

29
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,719
and usually come with a fixed lens.

30
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:38,080
That's right. And then there are SLRs and DSLRs, which are bigger,

31
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,640
and you can change the lenses on these cameras,

32
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,760
and they allow for a lot of manual control.

33
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,400
And there are also mirrorless cameras, which are a cross between compact cameras and DSLRs.

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,880
They are small, like a compact camera, but you can also use the same lenses on them

35
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,120
that you can use on DSLRs.

36
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,160
And of course, there are other cameras on smartphones,

37
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,040
and these are convenient and they're becoming increasingly sophisticated.

38
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,400
Phil Hall is the editor of TechRadar magazine.

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,280
He was asked on the BBC programme You and Yours,

40
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,800
if he thought smartphones would make other cameras obsolete.

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,960
What is his opinion?

42
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,840
I don't think so.

43
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,879
I think while compact cameras are really dropped off a cliff,

44
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,240
it's the lower ends of cheap compacts,

45
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,800
where people have opted for a smartphone.

46
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,840
And I think manufacturers are looking at the more higher end premium cameras,

47
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,640
high end compacts, DSLRs, which are the ones you can attach lenses to a mirrorless camera.

48
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,159
So the market's changing.

49
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,400
I don't think there'll be a time soon,

50
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,280
or yet the smartphone will take over the camera completely.

51
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,400
So does Phil think smartphones will kill the camera?

52
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,079
In a word, no.

53
00:02:56,079 --> 00:03:00,960
He does say that sales of cheap compact cameras have dropped off a cliff.

54
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,719
This rather dramatic expression describes a very big fall in sales.

55
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,560
This is because the kind of consumers who would choose a compact camera

56
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,599
are now opting for the camera on their smartphone.

57
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,199
When you opt for something, you choose it rather than something else.

58
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,400
For people who want a quick, easy-to-use and convenient way to take reasonable quality photos,

59
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,599
compact cameras used to be the best choice,

60
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,759
but now it's a smartphone.

61
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,680
So the camera makers are now moving to the more high end market,

62
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,000
the DSLRs and mirrorless cameras.

63
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,159
So who is still buying these more expensive cameras?

64
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,280
Here's Phil Hall again.

65
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,240
I think some of it is people who are picking up a smartphone

66
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,319
and getting into photography that way.

67
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,800
And that's a really great step into photography.

68
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,840
I think people are probably sometimes getting a bit frustrated with the quality.

69
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,560
Once they start pushing their creative skills and then looking to see what's the next

70
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,639
wrong up. So people wanting to broaden their creative skills a bit.

71
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,319
Who does he say might be buying cameras?

72
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,359
He says that people who are getting into photography might get frustrated with the quality of

73
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:20,000
smartphones. Getting into something means becoming very interested in it.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,159
And if you're frustrated with something, it means you're disappointed with it.

75
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:25,599
You're not happy with it.

76
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:31,120
So people who have got into photography with a smartphone but are frustrated with its limitations

77
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,759
and wants to be more creative are going to the next level. They're moving up.

78
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,360
They are, as Phil said, taking the next rung up.

79
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,360
Now a rung is the horizontal step of a ladder.

80
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,399
So the expression taking the next rung up is a way to describe doing something at a higher level.

81
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,759
Now talking of higher levels, did you get this week's quiz question right?

82
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,240
The question was when was the first phone with a digital camera released?

83
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,319
Was it 2000, 2004 or 2007?

84
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,120
The first phone with a digital camera was released in 2000.

85
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,680
Now to take us up to the end of the programme, let's look at the vocabulary again.

86
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:19,759
First we have the objective, obsolete, which describes something that's been replaced and is no

87
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,519
longer the first choice.

88
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:26,639
When the expression to drop off a cliff is used about, for example, sales numbers,

89
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,560
it means sales have fallen significantly over a short period of time.

90
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,000
To opt for something means to choose something.

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,040
And when you become very interested in an activity, you can say that you get into it.

92
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,040
If you're trying to do something and you can't do it because you don't have the skill,

93
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,240
or the equipment you are using is not right or not good enough, you can become frustrated.

94
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:57,199
And developing your skills to a higher level can be described as taking the next rung up.

95
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,199
Right, that's all from us in this programme.

96
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,240
Do join us again next time and don't forget that in the meantime,

97
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,000
you can find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and of course,

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,879
our website, BBCLearningEnglish.com.

99
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:10,079
See you soon, goodbye.

100
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,560
Bye!
