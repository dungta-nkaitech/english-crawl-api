00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Sam.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And I'm Rob. When Sarah Ott was growing up in Florida in the 1990s, she loved playing in nature.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:37,000
She picked up litter in the street and took it home to recycle. But later, in college, Sarah became surrounded by people in her community who didn't share her love of the environment.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
People who didn't believe that climate change was real. And slowly, Sarah started to doubt it as well.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Climate deniers, people who don't believe that climate change is happening, or that it isn't caused by humans,

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
make up around 9% of the American population, according to some estimates.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Now, Sarah works as a climate campaigner at the US National Centre for Science Education, teaching children the science behind climate change.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But her journey there was a difficult one. And she lost many friends on the way.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
In this programme, we'll be discussing climate deniers and finding out how to talk with people who doubt the science of global warming.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And as usual, we'll be learning some new vocabulary as well.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But before that, I have a question for you, Rob.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Whatever climate deniers think, there is strong agreement on the issue among scientists on the intergovernmental panel on climate change, the IPCC.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So what percentage of the world's scientific community agree that climate change is real?

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Is it A, 79% B, 89% or C, 99%?

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh, I'll have a guess and I'll say it's 99%.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay, I will reveal the answer later in the programme, Rob.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Marco Silva is a climate disinformation reporter for the BBC.

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He told BBC World Service programme the climate question what he's learned about reporting on the issue from around the world.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It is quite important to make here a very clear distinction between being wrong, ill informed about climate change and being a full-blown climate denier.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
A lot of people may not be very well versed with the science, the facts of climate change.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
To be honest, they can at times be quite complex, quite dense.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Some people may have genuine questions about the subject.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So with information with facts, those people can be convinced.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Climate deniers, though, people who reject the basic facts of climate change are likely to be more difficult to persuade.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Marco distinguishes a full-blown climate denier, someone who is completely committed to the idea, from someone who is simply ill informed,

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
meaning someone who knows less than they should about a particular topic.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Marco thinks it's possible to persuade an ill informed person that climate change is a fact, for example, by sharing personal stories of how the weather has changed in recent years, or by asking them why they doubt the scientific evidence.

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Full-blown climate deniers, on the other hand, are much harder to persuade.

31
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Here's Marco Silva again, sharing some advice on how best to talk to people about the climate.

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
With BBC World Service Programme, the climate question.

33
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
A number of researchers in academics have looked into exactly this topic before.

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Professor Sandef and Alinen, professor of social psychology at University of Cambridge, is one of them.

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
He's been looking into this long and hard, and when I spoke to him, he gave me a couple of tips.

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
For instance, don't challenge a climate denier directly.

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Don't confront them, telling them that they're there, so that, throwing insults at them, that their beliefs are wrong.

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That sort of attitude or strategy is only likely to backfire.

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
If you do that, the chances are people are just going to hold on to their views even more firmly.

40
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Marco mentions Professor Vanda Linden, a psychologist who has taken a long, hard look at the issue of climate denial.

41
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If you take a long, hard look at something, you examine it very carefully in order to improve it for the future.

42
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Professor Vanda Linden advises us not to challenge climate deniers directly, and never to throw insults, to say offensive, hurtful things directly to someone.

43
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This approach is unlikely to work, and will probably backfire or have the opposite effect from that intended, such as making that person's opinion even stronger.

44
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Instead, what's needed is understanding and empathy, realizing that climate deniers cannot control the life events that led them to mistrust science.

45
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And the patients to try to show them the difference between fact and fiction.

46
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Okay, it's time to reveal the answer to your question now, Sam.

47
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What percentage of the global scientific community agree that human cause climate change is real?

48
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And I guess it was 99%.

49
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And that was the correct answer, Rob.

50
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Aha.

51
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The scientific evidence for a climate emergency is overwhelming, leaving just the question of what we do about it.

52
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this program on climate deniers.

53
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
People who do not accept that climate change is real.

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Someone who is ill-informed knows less than they should about a particular topic.

55
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The adjective full-blown means completely committed or developed.

56
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The idiom to take a long hard look at something means to examine something very carefully in order to improve it for the future.

57
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If you throw insults, you say offensive, hurtful things directly to someone.

58
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And finally, if your actions backfire, they have the opposite effect from the one you intended.

59
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Once again, our six minutes are up. Bye for now.

60
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Bye-bye.

61
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Six minute English from the BBC.
