00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,759
Hello, this is 6 Minute English and I'm Catherine.

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,800
And I'm Sam.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,400
No, Sam. What can you tell us about crypto currencies?

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,920
The word is a combination of crypto from cryptography,

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,240
which is to do with using clever software codes to protect

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,920
computer information and systems and currency,

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,320
which is the money of a particular country.

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,160
So cryptocurrency very simply means code money.

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,359
We usually think of money as notes and coins, which come from a country's bank,

13
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,799
but a cryptocurrency doesn't have physical money.

14
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,960
It's purely digital and is not controlled by banks or governments,

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,120
but by the people who have it and very complex computer codes.

16
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,000
Perhaps the most well-known is Bitcoin.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,600
Well, you seem to know a fair bit about crypto currency actually.

18
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,040
Anyway, now a new player is joined in the digital money system

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,000
as Facebook have announced they are launching their own digital currency.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,040
They're calling it Libra and we'll be finding a little bit more about this topic in the program.

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,720
But first, a question.

22
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,600
Now, Sam, you mentioned Bitcoin as a well-known cryptocurrency.

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,719
It was in fact the first cryptocurrency, but when was Bitcoin created?

24
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:37,120
Was it a 2008, b 2009 or c 2010?

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,880
I'm going to say 2010.

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,000
Okay. Well, I'll reveal the answer later in the program.

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,560
Now, Jemay McKelley is a financial journalist and she was talking on BBC

28
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,519
Radio Program Money Box Live about the planned for Libra.

29
00:01:53,519 --> 00:02:00,480
She says it's not really a cryptocurrency because it's actually backed up by a number of real currencies.

30
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,719
So which currencies does she mention?

31
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,520
A cryptocurrency is normally subject to the whims of crypto markets, which are notoriously

32
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,319
volatile, whereas Libra is kept stable by being backed up by a basket of currencies.

33
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,920
In this case, the dollar or the pound, the euro in this which, Frank,

34
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,120
so which currencies did she say were backing up a Libra, Sam?

35
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,039
She said that the dollar, the pound, the euro and Swiss, Frank, were the currencies that would

36
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,640
be backing up Libra.

37
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,080
And this is different from regular crypto currencies, isn't it?

38
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,080
Yes. Cryptocurrencies are completely independent of financial institutions and other currencies.

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,240
And this can make them risky, can't it?

40
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,759
Yes. She says that cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile,

41
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,199
something that is volatile can change very quickly.

42
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:57,519
When it comes to currency, it means that its value can go up or down by a large amount

43
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,759
over a very short period of time.

44
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:05,280
And it's described as notoriously volatile because this has actually happened a few times

45
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,000
in the past. Something that's notorious is well known or famous, but for a negative reason.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,120
So the value of a currency going up and down in a volatile way, that's not positive.

47
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,800
If you want to take the risk, you could make a lot of money, but you could also lose a lot of

48
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,800
money more than you invested. So why are crypto currencies so volatile?

49
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,080
Most currencies are reasonably stable. This is the opposite of volatile.

50
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,120
They don't change a lot over a short period of time.

51
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,200
There can be big changes, but usually governments and banks control currencies to prevent it.

52
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,480
Cryptocurrencies don't have those controls.

53
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:52,719
What Jamei McKelley said was that they're subject to the whims of the crypto markets.

54
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,759
A whim is an unpredictable or irrational decision or trend.

55
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:04,479
And if you are subject to the whims of something or someone, it means that metaphorically,

56
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:11,439
you're a passenger in a self-driving car which may decide just to drive off the edge of a cliff.

57
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,079
So it might be an exciting ride, but it could end in disaster.

58
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,280
Right, it's time now to get the answer to the question I asked at the beginning of the program.

59
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:28,240
Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, but when was it created? Was it a 2008,

60
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,840
B 2009, C 2010?

61
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,560
I said 2010, but I'm not really sure.

62
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,960
And you're absolutely wrong. The correct answer is 2009, so no look for you this time.

63
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,319
But congratulations to everyone who did get that right.

64
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:49,040
Well anyway, let's round off today with a review of today's vocabulary.

65
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:55,920
First off, there is cryptography, which is the use of special codes to keep computer systems

66
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,680
and contents safe. A currency is the money of a particular country. For example, in the UK,

67
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,959
we have the pound in the US that is a dollar, and in many countries in Europe, the currency is

68
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:13,439
the euro. Cryptocurrency is a combination of cryptography and currency, and it's used for a

69
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:20,319
finance system that is based on secure digital coins that are not connected to banks or governments.

70
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:27,439
We then had the expression subject to the whims of. Whims are unpredictable decisions,

71
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:33,519
and if you're subject to them, it means you can't control them. You have no choice but to go

72
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:40,399
in the direction those whims lead. This means that the value of cryptocurrencies are notoriously

73
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:46,879
volatile. They have a history of going up or down in value by large amounts and very quickly.

74
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:52,000
And that's not good. Well, it might be good if it goes up. True. But if you want less risk,

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,679
if you want your currency to be the opposite of volatile, if you want it in other words to be stable,

76
00:05:57,679 --> 00:06:04,639
then maybe crypto currencies are not for you. Well, we are subject to the whims of our schedule,

77
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,000
which means our six minutes are up. We look forward to your company again soon. Bye for now.

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,600
Bye.
