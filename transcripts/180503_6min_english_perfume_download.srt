Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,480
And I'm Dan.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,080
In this program we're going to hear from someone who smells smells for a living.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,480
Although these are very expensive smells,

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,560
smells that we wear deliberately to make us smell good.

8
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,559
Oh, you mean cents and perfumes?

9
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,439
Yes, and perfumes are big business.

10
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,399
And that's the topic of our quiz in this program.

11
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,079
How much is the perfume industry in the UK worth each year?

12
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,879
Is it a 650 million pounds,

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,759
b 970 million pounds or c 1.3 billion pounds?

14
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,719
Well, I don't know, it smells.

15
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,239
No, this is just a guess, but I'll say 970 million pounds.

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,280
Well, I'll let you know the answer a little later in the program.

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,560
Now let's hear from Roja Dove, who is a perfumer.

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,599
He designs and creates very exclusive and very expensive perfumes.

19
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,840
In a recent BBC video, he talked about the power of smells.

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,599
What does he say? There is a very deep psychological connection between.

21
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,760
Who we are as a personality and the type of smells we like.

22
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,719
When we're born, the part of our brain which draws us smell is empty,

23
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,040
so we learn our response to smell.

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,880
And then when we smell that odorant again, it's like a trigger or a catalyst

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,160
that will revive the original association or memory.

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,520
So, Dan, what does he say? There's a very deep psychological connection between.

27
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,280
Between our personality and the kind of smells we like.

28
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,920
The point he's making is that the smells we experience when we're very young

29
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,719
can have a big psychological impact on us even later in life.

30
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,760
I know that feeling.

31
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,079
Smell is a very powerful sense.

32
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,800
The smell of something can take you right back in time and fill you with emotions.

33
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,439
Exactly. For example, when I walk through the perfume area of a department store,

34
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,280
I always feel a bit nostalgic because I can smell the perfume my first girlfriend used to wear.

35
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,200
It's a powerful sensation.

36
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,439
Dove used particular words and expressions to describe this, didn't he?

37
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,599
Yes. First, he used the word odorant to describe the smell.

38
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,120
It's not really a common word. We use it more frequently as part of the word deodorant,

39
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,039
which is something we buy to cover up what we think of as the unpleasant natural smell of our bodies.

40
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,759
These odorants, he said, can act as the trigger or catalyst for these memories.

41
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:45,599
Both the noun's trigger and catalyst refer to something that causes a particular response.

42
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,599
So a particular smell can be a trigger or catalyst for a particular emotion.

43
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,079
As well as being a trigger for memories, smells can, according to Dove, say a lot about your personality.

44
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:03,199
Here he is again, talking about the kind of scent to wear if you want to give a particular impression.

45
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:07,519
What does he say these scents make you appear very strong at?

46
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:14,079
The idea of the message you give off with scent, I think, can't be underestimated.

47
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:21,360
My suggestion would be to look for very, very woody, mossy, structured scents called chichets.

48
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,040
If the message you want to give across is that you are not someone to be mess with,

49
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,880
very, very strong in business or whatever, just not to be mess with.

50
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,520
So what do the scents he described make you seem strong at?

51
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,120
Business. They can make you seem very, very strong in business.

52
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
Hmm, and how does he explain that?

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,240
Well, he says that some scents give off a particular message.

54
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,640
The phrasal verb give off is often used to describe something that we broadcast about ourselves

55
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:59,040
without saying anything. So he's saying that our scent, our perfume, can give off a message

56
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,360
about the kind of person we are and that we shouldn't underestimate that.

57
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,319
If you underestimate something, you don't give it as much importance as it should have.

58
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,560
You don't take it seriously enough.

59
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,199
Then he goes on to talk about the particular scent that gives off the impression of being

60
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,959
very strong in business.

61
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,360
Yes, it's a woody, mossy scent, which suggests that you are not someone to be messed with.

62
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,800
Not to be messed with.

63
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,879
Yes, someone to be taken seriously, someone who's serious and who you don't want to try and trick.

64
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,959
Right, and talking of tricking, did we trick you with the quiz?

65
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,039
I asked what was the value of the perfume industry in the UK.

66
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,159
And I said £970 million.

67
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:48,479
And it was actually option C, which was an incredible £1.3 billion.

68
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,879
Wow, that is a lot of smelly stuff.

69
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:52,159
It is indeed.

70
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,959
Right, now time for a vocabulary recap.

71
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,519
What words and expressions did we have today?

72
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,479
Well, first we had odorant, an unusual word for something that smells.

73
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,640
Then two words with a very similar meaning, a trigger and a catalyst,

74
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,800
both of which refer to something that can make something else happen.

75
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,520
In this case, it was a particular smell making us remember something from the past.

76
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,960
So, sense can send us to the past, but they can also say something about our personality.

77
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,080
Yes, they can send unspoken information or give off messages.

78
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,280
And these messages should not be underestimated.

79
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:36,000
If you do underestimate the importance of smell, it means that you don't take those messages seriously.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,959
And finally, we heard the phrase to mess with someone.

81
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,479
To mess with someone means that you don't take them seriously.

82
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,199
You cause them trouble and that may cause you trouble.

83
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,839
Well, I certainly wouldn't want to mess with you judging by the messages you're giving off.

84
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,439
Ah, you mean my aftershave? Makes me seem powerful.

85
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,799
Actually, I was thinking more of the egg sandwich you had for lunch.

86
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,840
I really wouldn't underestimate the power of that.

87
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,680
Ah, on that note, I think it's time to end the program.
