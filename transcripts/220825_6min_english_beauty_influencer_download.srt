Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,719
And I'm Sam. In the UK, there's a well-known children's game called Happy Families.

5
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,800
Players have to collect all the cards belonging to one family.

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,679
There's a butcher, a baker, a carpenter, a doctor and a tailor.

7
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,560
Some of the traditional jobs that people in the UK have been doing for centuries.

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,159
But, since the invention of the internet and social media,

9
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:47,359
a more up-to-date list of jobs in the 21st century would be very different.

10
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,640
It would include modern jobs which didn't exist before.

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,400
Online jobs like web designer and YouTuber.

12
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,359
One of the most unusual of these new digital jobs is the influencer.

13
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,600
Someone who is paid by a company to promote their brand on social media,

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,319
encouraging people to buy their products.

15
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,519
In this programme, we'll meet two beauty influencers from different parts of the world,

16
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:17,680
Nigeria and Pakistan. We'll discover how these women are using their online influence

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,599
to change attitudes towards female beauty and, as usual,

18
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:23,759
we'll learn some related vocabulary too.

19
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,399
But first, I have a question for you, Sam.

20
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:32,560
YouTube makeup tutorials are very modern, but makeup has been around for a long time.

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,359
So, when was lipstick first used?

22
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,919
Was it A, around 3,000 years ago by the ancient Celts?

23
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:43,919
B, around 4,000 years ago by the ancient Egyptians?

24
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:48,639
Or C, around 5,000 years ago by the ancient Sumerians?

25
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,359
I'll say it was being used 5,000 years ago by the ancient Sumerians.

26
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,560
Okay, Sam will find out if you're right later on.

27
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,079
Dima Umay is a beauty influencer from Nigeria.

28
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,120
She's been creating makeup video tutorials for women of colour for 8 years

29
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,840
and has hundreds of thousands of followers.

30
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,159
Her videos go from eyebrow shaping tips to shopping trips in Nigeria's bigger city, Lagos.

31
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,319
Here's Dima telling BBC World Service programme the conversation,

32
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,000
how her life as an influencer got started.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,359
So, I did a makeup do's and don'ts and video in 2017.

34
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:30,719
I had seen a couple of people do it prior to that, but then, you know,

35
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,439
I kind of did it in a way that was a bit funny.

36
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,280
Maybe cracked a couple of jerks around the ways or the,

37
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,879
maybe not so great ways some people were doing things at the time.

38
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,599
And that video just took off.

39
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,680
In 2017, Dima made a YouTube video of makeup,

40
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,000
do's and don'ts. Rules about what to do and what not to do in a certain situation,

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,159
or when doing a certain activity.

42
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,799
Dima wasn't the first Nigerian influencer to post videos on YouTube,

43
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:07,199
but the difference was her humour, the way she laughed and cracked or told jokes.

44
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,039
More and more people started watching Dima's makeup videos and they soon took off,

45
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,400
meaning they suddenly became successful and popular.

46
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,599
Our next beauty influencer is Ramal Membud,

47
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,239
a photographer turned makeup artist based in Islamabad, Pakistan.

48
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,560
As well as makeup tips, Ramal creates colourful face painting designs,

49
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,919
which she says helped her through a period of depression.

50
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,079
She has popular Instagram and YouTube accounts on which she shares content to help other women

51
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:40,239
with their confidence and mental health.

52
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,159
Like Dima, Ramal now has Instagram followers numbering in the hundreds of thousands.

53
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,640
So how does she decide what to share in her blogs and videos?

54
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,840
What boundaries does she set for her followers?

55
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,600
Here's what Ramal told BBC World Service programme, the conversation.

56
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,800
Well, people are very intrigued about your personal life as a blogger.

57
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,680
That's a given, but you need to have strong boundaries.

58
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,560
I do share about my family and friends.

59
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,599
You actually have to ask people if they are comfortable being on your platform or not.

60
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,439
Ramal says her followers are intrigued about her personal life.

61
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,720
If you're intrigued, you're very interested in someone,

62
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,960
often because of something unusual or unexpected about them.

63
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,079
Ramal accepts that her followers' interest in her personal life is a given,

64
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,959
something that is considered to be a fact or that is certain to happen.

65
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,680
For example, you could say it's a given that there will be champagne

66
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,000
at a typical British wedding, meaning it's certain it's a fact there will be champagne.

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,759
But just because her followers' interest in her life is a given,

68
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,039
that doesn't mean Ramal shares everything with them.

69
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:59,120
She has to set boundaries.

70
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,560
Both Dima and Ramal make money as beauty influencers,

71
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,680
but what's amazing is how they're using social media to start conversations about what

72
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,120
beauty means to women in their country and sharing some great lipstick tips as well.

73
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,280
And speaking of lipstick, let's reveal the answer to my question, Sam.

74
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,920
I asked you when lipstick was first used.

75
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,079
I said it was around 5,000 years ago by the ancient Sumerians.

76
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,240
Which was the correct answer?

77
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,680
Ancient Sumerians, both men and women, painted their faces, eyes and lips.

78
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,840
A very early kind of lipstick.

79
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,079
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from this program on influencers,

80
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:43,199
people who influence their social media followers to try different products.

81
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,560
Doos and don'ts are rules about what you should and shouldn't do in certain situations.

82
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,120
To crack a joke means to tell a joke.

83
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,319
The phrasal verb take off means to suddenly become popular or successful.

84
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,199
If you are intrigued, you are interested in someone,

85
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,920
often because of something unusual about them.

86
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,519
And finally, a given.

87
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,800
Describe something that is considered to be a fact,

88
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
or that is certain to happen.

89
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,639
Once again, our six minutes are up.

90
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,599
Goodbye for now.

91
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:12,000
Bye bye.
