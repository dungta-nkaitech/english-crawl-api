00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,240
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,359
And I'm Beth

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:15,919
Can I ask you something, Beth?

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,199
Beth?

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,000
Hello, Beth, are you listening?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,359
Oh, sorry, Neil. I was checking my Instagram and Facebook and just sending this email.

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,039
Done. Okay. What did you want?

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,600
Well, I wanted to ask if you're getting addicted to your smartphone, but clearly, the answer is yes.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,640
Actually, Neil, I am worried about my smartphone use and it's not just me.

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,120
Concerns are growing about the negative effects smartphones are having on adults and even more on children.

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,519
Studies show that girls who spend more time on social media are more likely to be anxious or depressed.

14
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:58,560
And smartphones have also been linked to delayed brain development and poor sleep.

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,640
Even so, around 60% of British 8-11-year-olds have a smartphone.

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,079
So, in this programme, we'll be asking, are kids better off without a phone?

17
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,079
And of course, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary too.

18
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,920
But first, put your phone away, Beth, because I have a question for you.

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,719
The US has one of the highest levels of smartphone use, but, according to a recent survey,

20
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:31,760
how long does the average American 11-14-year-olds spend looking at a screen every day?

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,879
Is it A, 5 hours, B, 7 hours, or C, 9 hours?

22
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:42,480
Hmm, I'll guess American teens spend 5 hours a day on screens.

23
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,239
Okay, Beth, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

24
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:52,799
BBC journalist, Maira Anubi, has a 9-year-old daughter who desperately wants her own phone,

25
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,319
but Maira isn't convinced.

26
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,799
As she explained to BBC World Service programme, people fixing the world.

27
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm worried about how much time she'll spend on her own device.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,159
And what she might even see there? I mean, she's only 9 at the end of the day.

29
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,919
But, at the same time, I don't want her to feel left out, because some of her friends already

30
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:17,840
have smartphones. And these are chance that she'll miss out on play dates or kids trans cat videos

31
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,480
or online chats with her besties. So, I'm torn between wanting her to be in our world

32
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,520
and also letting her be in her own mini-world with her friends.

33
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,560
Maira is worried about her daughter and says at the end of the day, she's only 9.

34
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,240
Maira uses the phrase at the end of the day to mean after everything is considered.

35
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,080
Maira's daughter wants to chat with her besties, her best friends.

36
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,400
But Maira worries she'll get hooked on social media, see harmful content or spend too long online.

37
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,120
Maira is torn between letting her daughter get a phone and not.

38
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,760
If you're torn between two things, you can't decide between two possibilities,

39
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,280
leaving you feeling anxious.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,840
Parents like Maira are having to make an impossible choice.

41
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,760
Either give their children potentially harmful devices or risk alienating them from their

42
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,679
friends who do have smartphones.

43
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:21,280
In February 2024, Mom's Daisy Greenwell and Claire Fernyho started a WhatsApp group encouraging

44
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:28,159
parents to not give their child a smartphone until the age of 14, with no social media access

45
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:35,359
until 16. Soon the phone-free group of families grew into a movement, smartphone-free childhood.

46
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:40,879
Here Mom Daisy Greenwell explains more to BBC World Services people fixing the world.

47
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,680
Everyone I spoke to said, yes, it's a nightmare getting your child a phone, but you've got no

48
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,519
choice you have to because everyone else is doing it. You can't leave them on their own.

49
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,680
So Claire and I decided to start a WhatsApp group to support each other.

50
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,120
I posted about it on social media and it went viral. The group was full, so we encouraged people

51
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,960
to start one in your region and your county and they sprung up all over the country right in front

52
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,639
of our eyes. It was amazing. And now there's over 100,000 people in the UK who are in our

53
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:17,199
community. At the start Daisy says it was a nightmare, a very unpleasant situation.

54
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,879
Everyone else's kids had a phone and Daisy didn't want her children to feel left out.

55
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,599
But soon more families got involved and the group went viral. It spread quickly and widely

56
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:35,919
on the internet and social media. Within months new groups started up across Britain right in front

57
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,759
of Daisy's eyes. If you say something happens right in front of your eyes, you're emphasising

58
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,520
that something surprising or unusual happened directly before you.

59
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,000
The smartphone free childhood campaign has grown rapidly in schools and there are now groups

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,879
in 18 countries around the world offering kids a circle of friends to play and chat with in the

61
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:05,600
old fashioned way face to face. Okay, why don't you reveal the answer to your question Neil?

62
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,960
Yes, I asked how long the average American teenager spends looking at a screen and you

63
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,280
guessed five hours a day, which was the wrong answer I'm afraid Beth. It's actually even longer,

64
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,840
around nine hours a day spent on screens. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this

65
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,600
programme starting with the phrase at the end of the day, meaning after all the relevant facts

66
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,080
have been considered. Your bestie is slang for your best friend.

67
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,719
Someone who's torn between two things finds it difficult to choose between them,

68
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:44,719
making them feel anxious. A nightmare is a very unpleasant experience or event.

69
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:50,799
If a video or story goes viral, it spreads quickly on the internet through social media and email.

70
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:55,360
And finally, if you say something happened right in front of your eyes,

71
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,719
you're emphasising that something surprising or unusual happened directly before you.

72
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,520
Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now. Bye.
