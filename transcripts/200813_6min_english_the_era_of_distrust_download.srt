00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,879
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:17,920
And I'm Rob.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,440
As well as bringing the world to a halt, the coronavirus epidemic has led to an increase in

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,280
misinformation, lies and conspiracy theories on the internet.

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,039
In an era of fake news, where even the President of the United States has accused of spreading

8
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:38,960
misinformation, could it be that we are living through a crisis in trust? What is trust?

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,480
And who should we place our trust in? These are some of the questions we'll be discussing in this

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,719
programme. And we'll be hearing from a philosopher who believes the problem is not about trust itself,

11
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,400
but about trustworthiness, the ability to be trusted as being honest and reliable.

12
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,479
And as always, we'll be learning some related vocabulary along the way.

13
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:06,879
Of course, telling lies and lacking trustworthiness is nothing new. Just think of the Trojan

14
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:11,920
horse used to trick the ancient Greeks. More recently, the American financier,

15
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,719
Bernie Maddoff, became infamous as the biggest swindler in history. In 2009, he was sentenced to

16
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:25,680
150 years in prison for his part in the Ponzi scam. But how much did he defraud from investors?

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:35,920
That's my quiz question. Was it A, 6.5 million dollars, B, 65 million dollars, or C, 65 billion dollars?

18
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,120
I'll say B, 65 million dollars. Okay, Rob, we'll come back to that later.

19
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,680
Generally speaking, trust can be described as a judgment that someone can be believed and relied

20
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,320
upon. When we trust each other, it makes life easier, quicker and friendlier.

21
00:01:54,879 --> 00:02:00,719
Society can't function without trust. So does that mean the more trust the better?

22
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,159
Well, not according to philosopher Onora O'Neill, here he is speaking to David Edmunds,

23
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,519
presenter of the BBC World Service Programme, The Big Idea.

24
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,959
We have another word which is gullible. And if you simply place trust indiscriminately

25
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,039
without making a judgment about whether the other personal institution is trustworthy,

26
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,280
then just trusting to luck, as we say, is probably not a virtue.

27
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,120
There's a difference between trusting someone because you have good reason to believe them

28
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,959
and being gullible. That's easy to deceive because you trust and believe people too quickly.

29
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:45,280
If you don't judge who is trustworthy and who is not, you are trusting to luck, simply believing

30
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,799
or hoping that things will happen for the best. But being gullible and trusting to luck

31
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,920
is exactly how Bernie Madoff was able to trick so many people into giving him their money.

32
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,719
Their biggest mistake was to trust him indiscriminately in a way that does not show care or judgment,

33
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:09,040
usually with harmful results. So if indiscriminately trusting people is such a bad idea,

34
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,360
how do we avoid it? How can we tell who is trustworthy and who is not?

35
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,680
Here's the BBC World Services big idea presenter David Edmunds asking Onora O'Neill to give

36
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:27,599
some details. An individual or organisation is trustworthy if they can justifiably be trusted.

37
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:34,080
To be trustworthy they need three ingredients. First, honesty, people have to be able to believe

38
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,480
what they're told. Second, competence. Beyond honesty and competence there's a third element

39
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,480
to trustworthiness, reliability. That's the boring one, that's just being honest and competent

40
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:53,039
each time, so that it's not enough to be episodically honest and competent for some of the things

41
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:59,280
you claim to be able to do but not others. Philosopher Onora O'Neill identifies three

42
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,239
ingredients for trustworthiness. Honesty, competence and reliability.

43
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:10,159
Competence means the ability to do something well. You would trust a car mechanic to fix your broken

44
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,280
car engine, but you wouldn't go to them for dental work. They're not competent to remove your

45
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,240
tooth like a dentist is. And you wouldn't trust your dentist to fix your broken down car either.

46
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,360
Onora O'Neill also mentions reliability. Being trustworthy because you behave well all the time

47
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,199
and keep all the promises you make. It's the combination of these three being honest, competent

48
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,360
and reliable that makes someone truly trustworthy. And not someone like Bernie Maddoff who would run

49
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:45,360
off with your money and entire life savings. All of which brings me to my quiz question, do you

50
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,360
remember Rob? Yep, I do. You asked how much Bernie Maddoff stole from the American investors he

51
00:04:51,360 --> 00:05:00,560
lied to and I said be $65 million. But in fact it was C$65 billion, a lot of money to give to such

52
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:07,120
an untrustworthy man. So we've been discussing whether there is a crisis of trust and asking how to

53
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,000
know who is trustworthy, able to be trusted as honest, competent and reliable.

54
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,360
Placing your trust in someone trustworthy is very different from being gullible,

55
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,280
easy to trick because you trust and believe people too quickly. And it can also be unhelpful to

56
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,399
trust things to luck, simply hope or believe that everything will work out for the best.

57
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,959
Both of these problems come about when people trust indiscriminately in an unsystematic way that

58
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:40,479
does not show care or judgment, usually with harmful results as Bernie Maddoff's victims found

59
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,639
out to their cost. But luckily there are many trustworthy people around and we can spot them

60
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,439
using three criteria. Honesty, in other words not lying, competence and reliability.

61
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,959
Competence means an ability to do something well in the correct and effective way.

62
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:04,399
And reliability means being honest and competent all the time, not just being honest sometimes

63
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:10,639
or reliable in some actions but not others. That's all for six minute English. Bye for now. Bye bye.
