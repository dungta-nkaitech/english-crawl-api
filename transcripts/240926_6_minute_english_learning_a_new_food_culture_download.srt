00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,960
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,200
And I'm Beth

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,199
Every country has its own favourite foods

5
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,400
So when people leave home and move to a different country

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,000
Getting used to the new food there can be a surprise

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Food can have strange sounding names

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,800
If you know what a toad is, it's an animal very similar to a frog

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,799
You might be surprised to hear that a famous English meal is toad in the hole

10
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:38,799
Don't worry though, it's made with sausages, not toads

11
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:44,400
In this programme we're exploring people's first impressions of a new culture through its food

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:51,000
We'll be hearing how two women, one a refugee, the other a dietician, adapted to the food of their new home

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary too

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,799
But first I have a question for you Neil

15
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:02,200
A British summer wouldn't be complete without a traditional cream tea

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,000
Skons, cream and jam eaten with a cup of tea

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,200
It sounds lovely, but strangely there have been many arguments over cream teas

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,400
So is the cream tea debate about

19
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,200
A, whether to drink tea or coffee

20
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,400
B, whether to put cream or jam onto the scone first

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,600
Or see whether strawberry or raspberry jam is better

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,000
Well, I think the controversy is whether to add cream or jam first

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,600
Okay Neil, I'll reveal the correct answer later in the programme

24
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Natalia Techenko arrived in the Netherlands after leaving her home in Ukraine following the Russian invasion

25
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,200
She moved in with Veronica Grzefska, who's originally from Poland

26
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,400
And her family, starting them on a journey to open their own restaurants in Natalia's kitchen

27
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Here's Natalia talking with BBC World Service programme The Food Chain

28
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,000
Not the... of course

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,400
At first it felt like I am well out of what they call my comfort zone

30
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,599
When you stay in a certain environment you get used to it

31
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:12,199
But when you move to another country where you live and work

32
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:17,399
you experience difficulties and you have to adapt to get used to local foods

33
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:20,799
Here they don't have some of the staples we had in Ukraine

34
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:22,799
Ingredients are different

35
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:28,799
And so you start working with local foods, find replacements, cook with what you have

36
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:32,799
At first Natalia felt out of her comfort zone

37
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:37,199
A familiar situation in which someone feels secure and in control

38
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,199
She had to adapt to her new life in the Netherlands

39
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,199
She had to change in order to succeed in her new situation

40
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:50,399
Some of the staple ingredients Natalia used in Ukraine weren't available in the Netherlands

41
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:58,399
A staple is a basic and important type of food that is regularly eaten by a large portion of the population

42
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:04,599
So Natalia adapted her recipes, replacing Ukrainian with Dutch ingredients

43
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:08,599
to create a new kind of cooking which her customers loved

44
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,599
Our second story involves Rachel Winter Roach who left her home in England

45
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,799
to work on the sunny island of Tobago in the southern Caribbean

46
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:21,599
Here Rachel explains some of the food challenges she faced

47
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,599
Sue BBC World Service Programme, the food chain

48
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:32,599
When I came out to the Caribbean I was really in for a shock when it came to

49
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:40,599
The flavoring and seasoning food and seasoning is really, really an integral part of food preparation here

50
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:44,599
Here the seasoning is multiple, multiple layers

51
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:51,599
It took me a while to get used to it because everybody has their own way of seasoning and their own little tweaks

52
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:58,599
And there are no quantities so it really takes a lot of practice, a lot of trial and error

53
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:03,599
And I think my family did not always appreciate the errors in the trials

54
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,599
When Rachel moved to Tobago she was in for a shock

55
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:15,599
The phrase to be in for a shock means to be sure of experiencing a surprising or unpleasant situation

56
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:23,600
In Rachel's case the surprise involved seasoning, the salt, herbs and spices added to food to enhance the flavor

57
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,600
In the Caribbean seasoning is a big deal

58
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:33,600
Everyone has their own seasoning recipe including little tweaks or small adjustments which they have added themselves

59
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,600
It took time for Rachel to develop her seasoning skills mainly through trial and error

60
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:46,600
A way of solving problems by trying a number of different methods and learning from the mistakes you make along the way

61
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,600
Whether you're fleeing war, starting a new job or enjoying a cream tea

62
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,600
It seems there's lots to learn about a place from its food including Britain

63
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,600
So I think it's time to reveal the answer to my question Neil

64
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Why is the traditional British cream tea controversial?

65
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Well I guess it was because people disagree about whether cream or jam should go on the scorn first

66
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Which was the correct answer and anyone who says it's jam first is just wrong

67
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,600
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt in this programme starting with comfort zone

68
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,600
A situation in which you feel comfortable and in control

69
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,600
To adapt means to change so as to successfully fit in with a new situation

70
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,600
A staple is a basic and important type of food that is regularly eaten by a large portion of the population

71
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:45,600
The phrase to be in for a shock means to be guaranteed to experience a surprising or unpleasant situation

72
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,600
A tweak is a small adjustment to something in order to improve it

73
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:57,600
And finally if you solve a problem by trial and error you try a number of different methods and learn from the mistakes you make

74
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Once again our six minutes are up and remember to join us again next time here at six minute English

75
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Goodbye for now

76
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Bye
