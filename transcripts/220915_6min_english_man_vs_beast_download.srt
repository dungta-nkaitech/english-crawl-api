00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Sam.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And I'm Roy. Whether it's Sam and swimming upriver to lay their eggs or cheaters running faster than a car,

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
animals can do incredible things with their bodies.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Human bodies are no less incredible. Just think of Olympic swimmers and sprinters.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Our bodies work using just the energy provided by what we eat.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This means that the human body has to be incredibly efficient, using as little energy as possible to do what it needs to.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yet, even with our efficient bodies, no one can run as fast as a cheesa.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Not even Olympic champions. In this programme, we'll be asking, exactly how efficient is the human body?

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We'll be comparing human bodies' performance against each other and against some animals too.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And of course, we'll be learning some new and useful vocabulary as well.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But before that, I have a question for you, Roy.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Efficiency involves an input and an output.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's about the relationship between the amount of energy coming in, in other words, the food we eat,

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and the amount of energy going out, the usual movements and activities of day-to-day life.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So, according to this definition, which animal is the most efficient?

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Is it A, an ant? B, a whale or C, a human?

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Humans are the most efficient animal.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Okay, Roy. I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
To find out more about how the human body works, it's helpful to know how our species evolved.

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Here's Herman Ponce, Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology at Duke University,

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
speaking with BBC World Service programme Crowd Science.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Humans are remarkably efficient.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We walk on two very straight legs. If a human stands next to a dog, for example,

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
the dog is about that funny bent, classic dog leg shape, right?

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And that crouched posture is really typical of most animals.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Humans have a very straight leg, and so because of that, and because our legs are pretty long for our body size,

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
humans are part of the ape family. We're quite efficient.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Humans are apes and evolved from the same origin as gorillas and chimpanzees.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
One big difference, however, is that humans walk upright on straight legs

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
whereas most animals are crouched.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Bent over at the knee and leaning forwards to the ground.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This crouched posture is not an efficient way to move.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Other animals, like dogs, have flat backs and move on for bent legs called dog legs,

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
something bent in the shape of a dog's leg.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The word dog leg can also mean a sharp bend in a road or path.

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So the design of the human body makes it efficient compared to some other animals,

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
but how do humans compare with each other?

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
How do Kenyan athletes break long-distance running records while many of us struggle to run for the boss?

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The main reason, according to Lothbury University Physiologist Rona Pierce, is training.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But there may be other factors too, as she explained to BBC World Services crowd science.

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Age probably comes into it, and there's probably an optimal age for tendony elasticity.

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That drops off as you get older, so probably there's a sweet spot in age for running economy.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So in terms of weight, it depends what your weight is made up of.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So if you've got more muscle mass, that's going to help you.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Whereas if it's more fat than you've got to carry it.

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Efficient running depends on having flexible muscles and tendons,

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and this flexibility drops off or decreases as we get older.

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This means that in terms of running, the body has an optimal age, the best age,

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
or the age at which you are most likely to succeed.

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Body composition also plays a part.

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Efficient runners need high muscle mass, the amount of muscle in your body as opposed to fat or bone.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So training, age, muscle mass, and genetics are all factors which, when they come together, produce a sweet spot.

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The best possible combination of factors and circumstances.

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And from the evidence, it looks like my answer to your question was right Sam.

56
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Ah yes, I asked which animal was the most efficient, and you said it was sea, a human.

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Well, I'm sorry to say, but that was the wrong answer.

58
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The funny thing is, and scientists still don't understand why, but the bigger the animal, the less energy it uses, kilo for kilo.

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So, the most efficient animal.

60
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Is also the biggest, a whale.

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from the programme, starting with crouched,

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
a position which is bent at the knee, leaning forward and closer to the ground.

63
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
A dog leg can describe something which has a bent shape, especially a sharp bend in a road or path.

64
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The optimal age to do something is the best age to do it.

65
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
If something drops off, it decreases in quality or quantity.

66
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
A sweet spot is the best possible combination of factors or circumstances.

67
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And finally, muscle mass is the amount of muscle in your body as opposed to fat or bone.

68
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Once again, our six minutes are up. Bye for now.

69
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Bye.
