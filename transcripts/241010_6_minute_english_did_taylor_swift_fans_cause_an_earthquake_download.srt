00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, this is 6-Mute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Phil.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,200
And I'm Georgie.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,519
If you're a swifty, that's a fan of pop star Taylor Swift.

5
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,199
Her music rocks your world.

6
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:23,000
I like that phrase rock your world, Phil.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,400
It means that something makes your life enjoyable, right?

8
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:29,599
Well, yes, but actually no, Georgie.

9
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,799
I mean, Taylor Swift literally rocks the world.

10
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:39,000
At a recent concert in Edinburgh as part of Taylor Swift's Euras Tour,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,399
her fans' energetic dancing literally moved the earth

12
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,000
with seismic activity usually associated with earthquakes

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,399
detected four miles away.

14
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,399
Yes, it's hard to believe,

15
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:55,200
but in this programme we'll be hearing about the Swift Quake,

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,000
a powerful force like an earthquake coming not from nature,

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,800
but from a pop concert.

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,799
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

19
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,400
Great, but first I have a question for you, Georgie.

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,400
Actually, Taylor Swift's Edinburgh show wasn't the first music concert

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,600
to trigger seismic waves.

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,600
In 1992, the band Madness caused two earthquakes

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,000
that saw local residents evacuated from their homes,

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,599
but at which London venue did the concert take place?

25
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:35,599
Was it A, Hyde Park, B, the Royal Albert Hall, or C, Finnsbury Park?

26
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,200
Mmm, I'll guess the concert was held at the Royal Albert Hall.

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,599
Okay, Georgie, I'll reveal the correct answer at the end of the programme.

28
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:47,000
Following Taylor Swift's Edinburgh concert,

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
seismologist Emma Greenf and James Panton from Cardiff University

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,200
wanted to see if the same thing would happen at Taylor's concert in Cardiff.

31
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Size-mologists are scientists who study earthquakes and seismic waves.

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Emma and James set up their equipment to monitor and record ground motion

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,400
as the concert got started.

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,000
As James explains here to Marnie Chesterton,

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme Inside Science.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,800
Tell me about the peak on this graph that you're seeing and what that actually corresponds to.

37
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,000
In this top graph of the Red Wiggly line,

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,800
we're looking at the ground velocity in essentially meters per second.

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,800
So that's the velocity that the ground is vibrating up and down.

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,199
So this is literally people stamping up and down?

41
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:36,199
Yes, so this is all of the energy combined from the 75,000 people in the stadium,

42
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:39,199
jumping in unison and stamping in unison.

43
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:48,000
James, the British Geological Survey recorded 23.4 nanometers of movement in Edinburgh.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,400
What does that actually mean?

45
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,200
So what that means is that they recorded the ground flexing up and down

46
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,599
by a distance of 23 nanometers.

47
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:03,599
James' equipment recorded seismic movement when Taylor Swift started to sing.

48
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,400
Her hit song, Cruel Summer, created a peak, the highest point in the graph

49
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,599
which James' machine was drawing.

50
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:15,000
The peak was made by thousands of swiftees jumping up and down in unison,

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,200
together and at the same time,

52
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,199
creating something like a mini-earth quake.

53
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:25,399
The seismologist measured a ground movement of 23 nanometers.

54
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:28,000
That may not sound much, but remember,

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
this is the earth itself actually flexing or bending without breaking.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,799
So the ground is shaking, music is blasting, and thousands of fans are dancing.

57
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,799
But does this qualify as an earthquake scientifically speaking?

58
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,600
Here's James Panton and Marnie Chasterton again for BBC Radio 4's Inside Science.

59
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,800
James, impressive as this is to see coming up on your seismograph.

60
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,200
This is not the same leak really as an earthquake.

61
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,600
No, definitely not.

62
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,800
There have been some people who have tried to convert the energy output from concerts

63
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,800
into a local magnitude scale to make it comparable to an earthquake.

64
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,600
And when that's happened, we find magnitude that a generally less than one.

65
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,400
Sadly, the answer to Georgie's question is no.

66
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,199
The Taylor Swift concert wasn't technically an earthquake.

67
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,600
Marnie says the concert was not in the same league,

68
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,000
an idiot meaning not nearly as good or important as something else.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,600
Yes, the energy created by the music sound waves and thousands of fans jumping

70
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,400
did move the earth, but not in a way that's comparable or similar to a real earthquake.

71
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,200
By definition, an earthquake must break the earth's crust

72
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,000
and is caused by either the movement of tectonic plates or a volcano.

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,200
Officially, Taylor Swift didn't cause an earthquake,

74
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,000
but for the Swifties, it probably felt like one.

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
All of which brings us back to my question, Georgie.

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,400
I asked you about another earth-shattering concert involving the British band Madness.

77
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,000
But where in London did this show take place?

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,599
And I guessed it was at the Royal Albert Hall.

79
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:15,000
Which was the wrong answer I'm afraid Georgie,

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,199
in fact, the concert happened in Finchbury Park.

81
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:21,599
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt in this programme,

82
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:24,199
starting with the phrase rock your world,

83
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,799
meaning that someone or something has a positive effect on you,

84
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:30,000
making your life enjoyable.

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
A peak is the highest point of something.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,600
When things happen in unison, they happen together at the same time.

87
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,800
To flex means to bend without breaking.

88
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,600
If you say something is not in the same league as something else,

89
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,800
you mean it's no in here, it's good or important.

90
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,000
And finally, the adjective comparable means similar in size, amount or quality.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,199
Once again, our six minutes are up,

92
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,199
but remember to join us again next time for more trending topics and useful vocabulary.

93
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,000
Here at 6 Minute English.

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Goodbye for now.

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Bye.
