4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,280
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:17,960
I'm Neil.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,960
And I'm Sam.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,679
Sam, does this situation sound familiar?

8
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,760
It's a colleague's birthday next week.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,839
A male boss says to a female employee,

10
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:29,759
you're great at organizing things,

11
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:33,200
would you buy a card and get everyone in the office to sign it?

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,480
Oh, and we'll need to order a cake too.

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,799
Thanks, you're amazing.

14
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,119
Yes, I have seen that.

15
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,480
A male boss asks a woman to do all the jobs

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,200
that keep the office running,

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,359
but do nothing to advance her career

18
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:49,079
or improve her chances of promotion.

19
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,439
That's when someone moves up into a higher,

20
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,560
better paid position in a company.

21
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,480
Sadly, this happens a lot.

22
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,400
In many workplaces around the world,

23
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,119
it's the men who are considered born leaders

24
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:02,799
and promoted up the corporate career ladder,

25
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,120
while the women are given less important roles.

26
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,959
Even today, many working women find themselves

27
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,599
at a point in their career

28
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:12,959
beyond which they cannot progress.

29
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:14,840
An invisible barrier to succeed

30
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,200
referred to as the glass ceiling.

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,200
This in this programme will be meeting the members of the No Club,

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,599
a group of women saying,

33
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,319
no, to the glass ceiling,

34
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:27,599
by publicly questioning the kinds of jobs men and women

35
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,839
are asked to do in the workplace.

36
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:33,439
And of course, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

37
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,079
But first, I have a question for you, Sam.

38
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,519
Despite the glass ceiling,

39
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:39,599
women do make it to the top jobs

40
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,799
in many areas of work and business,

41
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:45,199
even in the male-dominated world of politics.

42
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:49,560
So, who was the first woman to become British Prime Minister?

43
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,439
Was it A, Theresa May,

44
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,000
B, Nicholas Sturgeon, or C, Margaret Thachar?

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,399
Hmm, I know the answer to this one, Neil.

46
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:59,399
It's C, Margaret Thachar.

47
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,799
OK, well, we'll find out later if you're right.

48
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,400
Professor Lee's Vestelund is one of the four academics

49
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,560
who co-wrote the No Club,

50
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,039
a book discussing how females disproportionately

51
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:16,039
take on the unimportant, less visible tasks at work.

52
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:20,120
Professor Vestelund calls these non-promotable tasks,

53
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,000
jobs like taking notes,

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,319
organizing social events or sharing meetings,

55
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,280
jobs that take time and effort,

56
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,120
but do little to increase company profits,

57
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,080
or to boost your career.

58
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,800
Research shows that most of these tasks are done by women.

59
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,200
Here's Lee's Vestelund,

60
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,879
explaining more to BBC World Service Programme, business daily.

61
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,719
We've been noticing gender differences in wages,

62
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,159
in advance management, in negotiation,

63
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,120
burnout for women is much greater than it is for men.

64
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,879
They're just satisfaction with their work is much greater.

65
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,359
And we've been trying to sort of address all these objectives

66
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:59,599
with lots of different methods and techniques,

67
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,599
and what is interesting about the non-promotable work

68
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,560
is that it's sort of in a very structural sense

69
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,120
contributes to all of those differences.

70
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,240
Professor Vestelund lists some workplace gender imbalances,

71
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,280
including job dissatisfaction and burnout.

72
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,360
That's tiredness and exhaustion caused by working too hard.

73
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,000
Many of these issues are made worse by non-promotable tasks.

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,920
Natalie Quail agrees.

75
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,639
Natalie started her successful dental cosmetics company,

76
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,960
Smile Time, after winning a business competition

77
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,599
on the TV show, Dragon's Den.

78
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,599
Here she tells BBC World Services Business Daily

79
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,319
about her experience of being asked to take on

80
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,960
non-promotable tasks in her work

81
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,599
as a trainee solicitor.

82
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,280
As a trainee solicitor,

83
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,240
pretty much every task that you take on

84
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,120
is a non-promotable task.

85
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,319
Note-taking gets one of them in meetings

86
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,240
where you're kind of told,

87
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,480
like, you can't really speak or say anything.

88
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,640
I was tasked with being their team party organizer,

89
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,640
so that was my role.

90
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,360
It does definitely occur that the women and the team,

91
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,560
the level of multitasking they're doing

92
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,960
is just far outstrips the men in a lot of cases,

93
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,760
for example, you know,

94
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:16,079
a lot of women in the team would also be juggling,

95
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,759
having kids at home, being a working mom.

96
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,120
Natalie found herself doing non-promotable tasks.

97
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,199
She thinks many women in the workplace

98
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,759
are expected to be good at multitasking,

99
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,199
doing more than one thing at the same time.

100
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,639
For working moms who are raising a family,

101
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,000
as well as developing careers at work,

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,240
this involves some juggling,

103
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,639
trying to manage your life

104
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,079
when you're involved in many different activities,

105
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:42,800
which all demand your time.

106
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,920
In the 40 years since the term glass ceiling was invented,

107
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,079
it seems not much has changed for working women.

108
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,400
But there is some good news.

109
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,040
The number of female managers and women working

110
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,800
in jobs traditionally seen as male

111
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,680
has increased dramatically.

112
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,920
And those companies where getting promotion

113
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,160
is based on ability, not gender,

114
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,120
have benefited from talented, hardworking female leaders.

115
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,400
And speaking of female leaders, Neil,

116
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,800
what was the answer to your question?

117
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,680
You asked me who was the first female British Prime Minister,

118
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,520
and I said, Margaret Thatcher, was I right.

119
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,759
You were right. Mrs. Thatcher nicknamed the Iron Lady,

120
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,680
became Prime Minister in May 1979.

121
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,600
The first woman to break the political glass ceiling

122
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,840
in the UK, an invisible barrier to advancing in your career.

123
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,759
OK, let's recap the other vocabulary we've learnt,

124
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,840
starting with promotion,

125
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,879
moving up into a higher, more important position

126
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,000
in your company.

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The term non-promotable tasks describes

128
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,199
those unimportant jobs which help your organisation

129
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,480
that do nothing to advance your career.

130
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,560
They are often given to women.

131
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,240
If you have burnout, you're exhausted from working too hard.

132
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,240
Multi-tasking is the ability to do several things

133
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,600
at the same time.

134
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,160
And finally, juggling involves managing

135
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,720
many different activities which all demand your time.

136
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,040
We've managed our time pretty well so far,

137
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,360
but now our six minutes are up.

138
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,120
Bye for now.

139
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,640
Bye.

140
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,520
Six new English from the BBC.
