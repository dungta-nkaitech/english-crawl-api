5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,400
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,879
I'm Dan and joining me today is Neil, hey Neil.

7
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:18,960
Hello Dan, what's on the agenda today?

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,559
Well, I'll give you a clue.

9
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,640
It's something that makes the world go round,

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,719
but it doesn't really exist.

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,600
In fact, if we all stopped believing in it,

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,760
it would have no use at all.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,800
What is it?

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,159
I haven't got a clue.

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,679
OK, how about this?

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,079
Hmm, money.

17
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:38,880
Yep.

18
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,399
And not just any money,

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,039
we're talking about cryptocurrency.

20
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,439
Currency is the money that's being used

21
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,679
in a given country at a certain time.

22
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,600
But what about the crypto part?

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,519
Well, crypto is a prefix, meaning hidden or secret.

24
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:55,120
It comes from the word cryptic,

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,640
which means mysterious or difficult to understand.

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,439
You may have heard about the most popular cryptocurrency

27
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,679
at the moment, the Bitcoin.

28
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:05,359
Well, I've certainly heard the name,

29
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:07,280
but I can't say I know what it is.

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
First, our quiz question.

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,960
When was the Bitcoin cryptocurrency first created?

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,319
Is it A 2004, B 2009, or C 2013?

33
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,519
Well, I think 2004 may have been a little early,

34
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,719
and I think 2013 could be a little late,

35
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,200
so the smart money's on 2009.

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,000
We'll see if you'll write later on in the show.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,879
So, Bitcoin, what do you know about it?

38
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,960
Well, I know it's a digital currency,

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,920
so presumably you can use it online to buy things.

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,320
You are right on the money, which means correct, both times.

41
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,640
Bitcoin is just like any other currency, except for two things.

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,760
First, it's not printed by governments or banks,

43
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,960
which means that it's not legal tender.

44
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,280
Legal tender means the official money

45
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,200
that can be used within a country.

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,719
So that means we can't use it to pay taxes or settle debts, right?

47
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,000
Exactly.

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,799
Governments won't recognize it as an official currency,

49
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,439
although it acts just like one.

50
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,400
You can use it to buy items from anyone who will accept it

51
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,120
and its value fluctuates.

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,840
Fluxuates means changes in level or amount.

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,000
And what's the second thing?

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,080
Ah, the second thing is that Bitcoin is a digital currency,

55
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,360
meaning that with the exception of a few tokens,

56
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,800
it largely exists online only.

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,160
You can't carry a load of Bitcoins around in your pocket.

58
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,800
Well, that makes a nice change.

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,080
Oh, dear Neil.

60
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,680
Was that a money pun?

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,240
Terrible.

62
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,280
So, if it's a digital only currency, where do new ones come from?

63
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,560
Can't I just say that I've got a million of them and make myself rich?

64
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,680
Well, no.

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,760
You see, even though Bitcoin is not regulated by a bank or government,

66
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,439
it still has a process that stops people from cheating.

67
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,840
There are only two ways to get Bitcoins.

68
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,120
You either trade them from someone or you go mining.

69
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,359
Ah, wait, I've heard about this.

70
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:06,399
This is when you use your computer to run calculations

71
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:09,359
which verify other Bitcoin transactions.

72
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:12,719
You get rewarded for this work by earning Bitcoins.

73
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,799
Yep, it's money for old rope,

74
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:17,280
which means it's an easy way to earn money.

75
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,759
Wow, I'm going to start mining immediately.

76
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,359
Well, you wouldn't be the only one.

77
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,439
Bitcoins' value has recently gone up quite a lot

78
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,000
and this has caused a lot of interest.

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,399
In fact, one stock exchange in Chicago has begun trading

80
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:34,479
in Bitcoin futures contracts.

81
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,759
A futures contract?

82
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,639
What's that?

83
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,039
I'll let BBC correspondent Rory Ketlin-Jones explain that.

84
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,439
The futures contract, a bet on where the currency will be a month from now,

85
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,000
soared above $18,000.

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That means investors believe Bitcoin,

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,960
which started the year worth under $1,000,

88
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,280
will continue to rise in value, albeit at a slower rate.

89
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,400
But at the big banks, there's still plenty of skepticism

90
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,359
about the currency.

91
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,919
Soared in this context means increased very quickly.

92
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:10,079
So now big investors are betting on the value of Bitcoin in the future.

93
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,240
Yes, but he also mentioned that the banks have a lot of skepticism.

94
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,199
That's a doubt that something is real or true.

95
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,240
In this case, whether Bitcoin is reliable or not.

96
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,639
Maybe it's best I don't get involved then.

97
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,519
After all, a fool and his money are soon parted.

98
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,480
Well, you don't have to be skeptical about the answer to our quiz.

99
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,319
We know that for a fact.

100
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,920
I asked you when the Bitcoin cryptocurrency was first created.

101
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,920
A 2004, B 2009 or C 2013.

102
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,680
And I said 2009.

103
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,960
And you were right.

104
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,759
Well done.

105
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,600
Shall we go over the vocabulary again?

106
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,040
First, we had currency.

107
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,800
That's the money being used in a given country at a certain time.

108
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,200
Name three currencies and their countries, Dan.

109
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,000
OK.

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
But for Thailand,

111
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,439
Rupi for India, and my favourite, Metacal for Mozambique.

112
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,760
Next, we had cryptic.

113
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,680
Something which is cryptic is mysterious or difficult to understand.

114
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,480
For example, what do rich people need?

115
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,360
Poor people have.

116
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,280
And if you eat it, you die.

117
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,360
Hmm, a cryptic riddle indeed.

118
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,480
I'll have to think about that.

119
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,960
Then we had legal tender.

120
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,680
That's the official money that can be used within a country.

121
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,640
The euro is legal tender within Spain.

122
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,200
But what was the legal tender before that?

123
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,720
Wasn't it the per seater?

124
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,520
Then we had fluctuates.

125
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,879
If something fluctuates, it changes in amount or level.

126
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,800
The stock market fluctuates.

127
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,200
But my love for my family never does.

128
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,439
Then we had sword, which means increased very quickly.

129
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,680
It's used with this meaning in the context of money,

130
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,120
prices and statistics.

131
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,840
Finally, we had skepticism.

132
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,280
Skepticism is doubt that something is real or true.

133
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
What sort of things are people skeptical about, Neil?

134
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,519
Some people think that human activity

135
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,759
hasn't caused climate change.

136
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,280
They are skeptical.

137
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,000
And that brings us to the end of today's six-minute English.

Goodbye.

00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,680
Goodbye.
