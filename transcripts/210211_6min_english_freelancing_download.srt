00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello, this is 6M8 English from BBC Learning English. I'm Georgina.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,120
And I'm Rob.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,920
Rob, what's the best job you've ever had?

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,199
Well, this one, of course. It's very creative with lots of variety.

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,600
Okay, any other reasons?

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,039
Well, yes, it's a permanent job, a staff job, with regular income and a pension.

11
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,840
Yes, these things can be important, but have you ever been freelance?

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,960
By that I mean working for yourself and selling your skills and services to different businesses.

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,799
Well, I work to some paper boy ones, delivering newspapers, but not really.

14
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,280
It's a risky way to earn an income.

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,799
It can be Rob, but many people choose to or have to work as a freelancer to survive.

16
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,439
And that's what we're talking about in this programme.

17
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,079
But let's start with a question for you, Rob.

18
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:04,959
Okay.

19
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,799
This is about job titles.

20
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,719
Back in the 19th century, what kind of job was a drummer?

21
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,079
Were they a, someone who played the drums?

22
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,479
B, a travelling salesman?

23
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,159
Or C, a music publicist who drums up?

24
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,959
Meaning encourages support for a band?

25
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,679
Well, it's got to be someone who plays the drums.

26
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:26,959
That's my kind of job.

27
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,239
Okay Rob, we'll find out if that's right at the end of the programme,

28
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,039
but let's talk more about work now.

29
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:38,399
Long on are the days of a job for life, where you spent your adult life working your way up

30
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,879
the career ladder at the same company.

31
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,919
Yes, that's right.

32
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:46,159
We work in many different ways now because the needs of businesses change frequently

33
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,079
and it needs to be agile, changing the size and type of workforce in order to meet demand.

34
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,919
So people need to adapt and some choose to work for themselves,

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,320
offering their skills to different businesses as and when they are needed.

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,879
But it can also be a lifestyle choice, as we're about to find out.

37
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:09,199
Yes, some people have chosen to become self-employed, working for themselves.

38
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,560
But also because of the recent coronavirus pandemic,

39
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,960
some people have been forced into this situation.

40
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:21,280
Let's hear from Carla Barker, who set up her own business after giving up her regular job.

41
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,439
She told the BBC Radio 4's programme, You and Yours, how she felt.

42
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:34,079
You know, the idea of giving up a solid permanent full-time paid, comfortable work is a bit petrified.

43
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:40,000
It is super scary because you then have that fear of, oh my goodness, can we do this?

44
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,239
You also have things creeping in that say, you know, like self-sabotage,

45
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,759
are you good enough to do this?

46
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,959
Are people going to want to take me on as a business?

47
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,759
So, Carla decided to go it alone and in formal way of saying work for herself.

48
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:02,079
She described giving up a full-time job as petrifying, so frightening you can't speak or move.

49
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:08,000
She may have been exaggerating slightly, but she also said it was super scary.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,359
I guess working for yourself must be scary as you're solely responsible for your own success.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,680
It's no surprise Carla had feelings of self-sabotage, having doubts and fears that stop to

52
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,959
achieving something.

53
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,640
Luckily, she persisted and things went well and many other people who have become self-employed

54
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,719
or freelance have overcome the fear and discovered the benefits.

55
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,240
Like Fiona Thomas, who's the author of a book called,

56
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,560
Ditch the 9-5 and Be Your Own Boss.

57
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,280
She also spoke to the BBC's You and Yours programme and explained why she gave up the 9-5,

58
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,400
the regular full-time staff job and how it helped her.

59
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,120
I kind of combination of wanting some creative fulfilment from a job,

60
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,840
compared to the job that I was in before, which is very much customer-based, working face-to-face

61
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,920
in hospitality, but I also wanted the flexibility to accommodate my mental health,

62
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,920
because I suffer from depression and anxiety and I find working in a rigid schedule in being

63
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,240
in front of a lot of people all the time really exacerbated a lot of my symptoms.

64
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,800
And I also wanted the financial freedom to be able to over time increase my income without

65
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,920
just having to wait on being promoted or getting a pay rise and traditional employment.

66
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:32,400
So, Waki for herself gave Fiona a good feeling that she achieved something she wanted to do.

67
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,240
It gave her creative fulfilment. It also meant she could work more flexibly and that helped her

68
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,040
with her mental health, because she didn't have to follow a fixed roto of tasks.

69
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,840
And it gave her financial freedom, meaning the money she earned was not controlled by someone else,

70
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,879
and she didn't have to wait for someone else to give her a pay rise.

71
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,439
Of course, that could be risky too.

72
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:01,360
Let's get back to my quiz question now Rob. Earlier, I asked you if you knew what job a drummer used

73
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,879
to do back in the 19th century. And obviously, a drummer plays the drums.

74
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,360
Well, you are sort of right, but a drummer also used to be an informal way of

75
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,600
describing a travelling salesperson. Because their job was to drum up business for a company,

76
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,920
meaning they try to increase sales.

77
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,759
Ah, very interesting. Although I know which drummer I would rather be,

78
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,080
a freelance drummer in a rock band.

79
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,360
And freelance is one of the words we've mentioned today.

80
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,879
To freelance means to work for yourself, selling your skills or services to different businesses.

81
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,920
Becoming self-employed can be petrifying, frightening, so you can't speak or move.

82
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,000
And starting out on your own can lead to self-sabotage,

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,280
having doubts and fears that stop you achieving something.

84
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,560
But it can also give you fulfillment, a good feeling of achieving something for yourself.

85
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,240
And having financial freedom means being able to control how you earn and use your money.

86
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,520
