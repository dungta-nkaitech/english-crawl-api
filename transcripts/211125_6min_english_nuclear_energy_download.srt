00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,359
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,879
And I'm Sam.

6
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:24,400
With Winter here, the rising price of oil and natural gas has become a hot topic.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,480
At the same time, climate change is also reaching emergency levels.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,960
And world leaders are looking for ways to reduce our consumption of fossil fuels.

9
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,399
Some think the best option is renewables,

10
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,920
types of natural energy, such as wind and solar power,

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,120
which can be replaced as quickly as they are used.

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,920
Others prefer a return to nuclear energy,

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,400
arguing that it's clean, green, and more reliable than renewables.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,359
But after infamous nuclear disasters, like those at Chernobyl and Fukushima,

15
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,600
questions about its safety remain.

16
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,200
In this programme, we'll be finding out how green nuclear power is, by asking,

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,640
when it comes to the climate, is nuclear a friend or foe?

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,519
But before that, Sam, it's time for my quiz question.

19
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:18,400
Many of the nuclear power stations built since the 1960s are reaching the end of their planned life.

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,879
And not everyone thinks they should be replaced.

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,520
In 2011, one country announced that it would phase out,

22
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,799
meaning gradually stop using nuclear power altogether, but which country?

23
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:36,399
Was it A Germany, B India or C Brazil?

24
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:38,560
I'll go with A Germany.

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,719
Okay, Sam, we'll reveal the correct answer later in the programme.

26
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,439
As Neil mentioned, whatever the advantages of nuclear power for the climate,

27
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,199
many members of the public have concerns about nuclear safety.

28
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,280
Probably the most well-known nuclear accident happened on the 26th of April 1986

29
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,480
at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Soviet Ukraine.

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,799
Dutch journalist Miriam Vossen reflects on what happened with BBC World Service programme

31
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,840
the real story.

32
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:15,680
The perceptions of nuclear energy of, I think, a whole generation has been shaped by high-impact

33
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,800
events, most notably the Chernobyl disaster, including myself.

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,400
I have vivid memories of how the media reported on this event and how scary it was,

35
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,800
and how frightened everyone was of the radioactive clouds drifting from the Ukraine towards Europe.

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,719
So this is sort of ingrained in people's minds, and for many, it hasn't been really been updated.

37
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,840
It was a frightening time, and Miriam says she has vivid memories,

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,039
memories that produce powerful feelings and strong, clear images in the mind.

39
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:54,879
The accident in Chernobyl changed many people's opinions of nuclear power in a negative way,

40
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,719
and these opinions became ingrained, strongly held, and difficult to change.

41
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:06,480
But Miriam believes these ingrained public perceptions of nuclear safety are out of date.

42
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:12,480
She argues that such accidents caused by human error could not happen in the modern

43
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,799
nuclear power stations used today.

44
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,599
What's more, nuclear creates a steady supply of power, unlike renewables,

45
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,000
which don't make electricity when the wind doesn't blow, or the sun doesn't shine.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,159
So maybe nuclear power is the greenest way of generating energy without fossil fuels.

47
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,079
Well, not according to Energy Institute researcher Paul Dorfman.

48
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:41,120
Nuclear power stations are located near seas or large lakes because they need water to cool down.

49
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,000
Paul thinks that soon rising sea levels will mean the end of nuclear

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,680
as a realistic energy option.

51
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,159
He thinks money invested in nuclear upgrades would be better spent,

52
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:59,120
making clean renewables more reliable instead, as he explained to BBC World Service programme,

53
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,000
the real story.

54
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,879
I think the key takeaways that nuclear's low carbon electricity unique selling point

55
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,319
kind of sits in the context of a much larger picture that nuclear will be one of the first

56
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,159
and most significant casualties to ramping climate change.

57
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:21,600
So, nuclear is quite literally on the front line of climate change and not in a good way.

58
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,560
That's because far from helping with our climate change problems, it'll add to it.

59
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,120
One advantage of nuclear power is that it produces electricity using little carbon.

60
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,920
Paul Dorfman calls this its unique selling point.

61
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:43,280
A unique selling point, which is sometimes shortened to USP, is a common way to describe the

62
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,200
feature of something that makes it different from and better than its competitors.

63
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,240
But that doesn't change the fact that rising sea levels would make nuclear and unrealistic

64
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,000
even dangerous choice. This is why he calls nuclear power a casualty of climate change,

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,720
meaning a victim or something that suffers as a result of something else happening.

66
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,560
This also explains why some countries are now turning away from nuclear power towards more

67
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,800
renewable energy sources, countries such as, well, what was the answer to your question Neil?

68
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,360
I asked Sam which country decided to gradually stop using nuclear power?

69
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,040
I said A, Germany.

70
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,640
Which was the correct answer?

71
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,640
In fact, around 70% of Germany's electricity now comes from renewables.

72
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,480
Okay, Neil, let's recap the rest of the vocabulary from this programme.

73
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,080
Starting with, to phase something out, meaning to gradually stop using something.

74
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,120
Vivid memories are memories that produce powerful feelings and strong mental images.

75
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,680
Opinions and beliefs which are ingrained are so strongly held that they are difficult to change.

76
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,040
Something's unique selling point or USP is the feature that makes it different from and

77
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,800
better than its competitors.

78
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,040
And finally, a casualty is a person or thing that suffers as a result of something else happening.

79
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,280
That's all from this look in Sen Nuclear and Renewable Energy.

80
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,079
Bye for now.

81
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,480
Bye.
