00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,679
Hello and welcome to 6Mooch English, I'm Neil.

4
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:20,960
And I'm Alice, Neil. What are you eating?

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,559
Peanuts.

6
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:27,839
Hmm. Did you know that one of the producers here has an allergy to peanuts?

7
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,679
No, I didn't, but they're not in the studio with us, so it doesn't matter, does it?

8
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,560
It only takes a tiny piece of peanut to cause a big allergic reaction in some people.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,759
An allergy, by the way, is a condition that makes you feel ill after eating,

10
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,560
touching or breathing in a particular substance.

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,359
And food allergies are the subject of today's show.

12
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,120
All right, put your peanuts down, Neil, and answer today's quiz question.

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,519
What substance is used to treat a severe allergic reaction?

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,000
Is it A. Penicillin, B. Adrenalin or C. Aspirin?

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,680
Okay, well, I'm going to go for A. Penicillin.

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,879
Well, we'll find out if that's the right answer later on.

17
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:17,920
Now, let's listen to Dr Marianne Williams talking about why being too clean may not be a good thing.

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,840
She is a dietician here in the UK.

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,560
For roughly the first month of life, the immune system is switched off in essence,

20
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,480
and everything they get exposed to in that first month of life, dogs, cats, aunts,

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,480
uncles, grannies, grandpas, family, dirt, everything, that is where they build up all the bacteria

22
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,520
that are then going to colonize their gut in the future.

23
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,120
Now, if you're born into a very sterile environment,

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,800
as is increasingly the case in the Western world, everything's kept terribly clean.

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:55,200
And one of the theories is that we just are not getting enough exposure to a variety of bacteria,

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,640
at that very, very early stage in that first month of life.

27
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:06,640
Dr Marianne Williams, the immune system is our body's defence against infection,

28
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,280
and it's switched off or not working for the first month of a baby's life.

29
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,480
And through exposure to lots of things in our environment,

30
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,400
that's family, pets, dirt and so on, young babies meet different bacteria for the first time,

31
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,840
which colonize or live and grow in their guts.

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,319
Yes, but in a sterile environment, babies don't get exposed to or don't meet a wide enough

33
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,680
variety of bacteria. Sterile means completely clean and free of bacteria.

34
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,400
And there's a theory that being too clean and bacteria free,

35
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,000
now we have soap, antibiotics and better sanitation, has led to an increase in allergies.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,960
So dirty play for babies is good. Mud pets picking stuff up off the floor and eating it.

37
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,840
Did you use to eat food off the floor when you were little Neil?

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,000
Used to, I still do, I enjoy food from the floor.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,480
Well Neil, what can I say? We're both lucky to be allergy free.

40
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,920
I have a friend who has an allergy to gluten, a protein found in wheat and some other grains,

41
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,439
and she has to be very careful about what she eats so she doesn't get ill.

42
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,879
The supermarkets are quite helpful though aren't they, with products free from this and free from that?

43
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,560
This is helpful, yes, but the food industry is now marketing their products to attract consumers

44
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,639
who don't have a proven or tested allergy. Why would you buy free from foods if you don't have

45
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:34,079
a food allergy? Well, people have started to believe that certain foods like gluten or dairy

46
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:38,240
are bad for us, though there isn't any medical evidence to support this.

47
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,919
Let's hear about how Ricketts, a disease caused by a lack of vitamin D in the diet,

48
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,799
is affecting some children in the UK. This is BBC reporter Mike Williams.

49
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,639
Ricketts is common in the developing world, but this is London in the 21st century.

50
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,839
These children aren't malnourished because they're too poor to eat well.

51
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:04,959
It's the opposite. They're often middle-class parents are spending money to give them foods with

52
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,560
ingredients taken out. It's as if some of us have become unnecessarily frightened of our food.

53
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:18,319
Ricketts usually affects malnourished children from poor countries, children who don't have enough

54
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:23,439
to eat and it makes their bones weak. But here in London, some parents are buying their children

55
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:29,680
expensive free from foods, for example to avoid dairy and sometimes making them very ill.

56
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:38,160
It sounds crazy, doesn't it? Yeah, it's nuts. Very good. Yes, nuts. That means crazy.

57
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,760
Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question.

58
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:49,840
Okay, then. So, earlier in the show, I asked, what substance is used to treat a severe allergic reaction?

59
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,800
Is it A, penicillin, B, adrenaline, or C, aspirin?

60
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,600
I said A, penicillin. And you were wrong, Neil. The correct answer is B, adrenaline.

61
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,400
An injection of adrenaline can be used to treat anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions

62
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:17,840
to insect stings, foods, drugs and other allergens. Antibiotics such as penicillin treat bacterial

63
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,520
infections and aspirin is a painkiller you might take for a headache.

64
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,640
Okay, can you tell us the words we heard today again, please, Alice? Sure, they are.

65
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:33,680
Allergy Immune system switched off.

66
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:45,360
Colonize. Get exposed to sterile, gluten, proven,

67
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:54,400
rickets, malnourished, nuts, anaphylaxis.

68
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,080
