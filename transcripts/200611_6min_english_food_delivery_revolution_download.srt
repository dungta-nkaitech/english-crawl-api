00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,960
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,080
And I'm Georgina. I'm going to order some takeaway food, Neil. Do you want anything?

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,679
Maybe a pizza, fish and chips, Indian curry?

7
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,679
Mmm, takeaway food to eat at home. That's a great idea.

8
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,079
Yes, I'll have a poke bowl, please.

9
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,600
What's that? It doesn't sound like typical takeaway food.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,200
It is nowadays, Georgina. Over the last few years, the explosion of food delivery apps,

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,000
like Deliveroo and Just Eat, has seen a revolution in takeaway food.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,240
Today, it's not just pizza and curries being delivered to people's front door.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,480
There's a wide range of food dishes and styles from all around the world.

14
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,679
And with cafes and pubs closed during lockdown,

15
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,959
more and more food chains and restaurants are switching to delivery-only services.

16
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:06,719
Takeaways. To bring meals to people who are isolating.

17
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,759
Over the last few weeks, many takeaway companies have seen orders increased dramatically

18
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,000
as people find themselves stuck at home due to the coronavirus pandemic.

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,199
But what are they choosing to eat? That's my quiz question for today, Georgina.

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,520
Last year, what was Deliveroo's most ordered dish? Was it A, Hawaiian poke bowls,

21
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,680
B, cheeseburgers or C, chicken burritos?

22
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,960
Mmm, I would have thought it was fish and chips, but I'll go with B, cheeseburgers.

23
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,600
Okay, we'll find out later if you were right.

24
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,520
One consequence of the increasing popularity of takeaways is something called dark kitchens.

25
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,920
Unlike apps such as Deliveroo and Just Eat, which connect customers to local takeaways,

26
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,719
these digital dark kitchens work as just for delivery restaurants.

27
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,079
Inside, chefs cook in kitchens without waiters, tables or diners,

28
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,079
preparing high quality dishes ready for delivery straight to your home.

29
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,439
One of the first dark kitchen operations taste-out was started by chef Anton Suleyare,

30
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:18,319
who in 2013 was working for Deliveroo when it was just a tiny company operating only in London.

31
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:25,280
Now he's in charge of 12 kitchens catering for customers in London, Paris and Madrid.

32
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,479
Sheila Dillon of BBC Radio 4's The Food Program went to the Bethnal Green area of East London to find out more.

33
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,719
When you go on the Taster website, the restaurant names are virtual.

34
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,719
All of them sold as designed for delivery by Taster.

35
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,479
What that means is all the menus drawn up by Siria chefs are designed to travel well,

36
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:53,840
chosen so they'll be warm, retained their texture and won't look like a dog's dinner when they come

37
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:01,680
off the back of a bike. So strangely, the delivery, the bike, has become a shaper of the foods we eat.

38
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,400
All the restaurants on Taster are virtual, existing online and created by computers to

39
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,719
appear like the real thing. Chefs cook the dishes using recipes and ingredients designed to travel

40
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:20,640
well, be transported a long way without being damaged or their quality being spoiled.

41
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,719
That's to avoid the takeaway food ending up like a dog's dinner,

42
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,680
an informal way to say something that looks messy or has been very badly done.

43
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,040
Usually the takeaways are transported in a box on the back of a delivery cyclist,

44
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:40,239
who rushes them from the kitchen to the customers home. It's a very modern way of eating,

45
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,159
which Sheila thinks has become a shaper of the foods we eat, meaning that it has a strong

46
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,719
influence on how a situation develops. However, some are worried that the increase in takeaways and

47
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:59,120
delivery only food means people are losing basic cooking skills. It's something that Taster Boss

48
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:06,960
Anton has noted too. There is a strong underlying trend that's maybe, you know, in 20s, 30 years,

49
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:13,599
people want to have kitchens and it's already happening in the US, for example. I love cooking,

50
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,800
it's one of my passion, but I'm really doing it occasionally on Sundays and everything and I see

51
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:24,800
it's going to almost become a weekend hobby. People choosing to eat takeaways instead of

52
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,720
cooking at home has become an underlying trend. A general development in how people behave,

53
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,879
which is real, but not immediately obvious. And in the future, cooking at home may even switch from

54
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:43,120
being a daily necessity to a hobby. An activity someone does in their spare time for pleasure or

55
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,600
relaxation. I do enjoy tucking into a takeaway sometimes, but personally I couldn't survive without

56
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,360
my kitchen meal. But could you survive without delivery? Remember in today's quiz question,

57
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,960
I asked you what delivery's most ordered dish was. I said B, cheeseburgers. But the correct answer was

58
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,600
A, Hawaiian poke bowls, a Hawaiian version of sushi. Now that's something I couldn't cook at home.

59
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,400
Today we've been discussing the revolution in takeaways and home delivered food, which in recent

60
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:20,639
years has become an underlying trend. A general development in how people behave or in this case eat.

61
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,000
Another trend has been the creation of virtual restaurants. Online restaurants which look like the

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,719
real thing, but exist only on the internet. Chefs create dishes using ingredients which travel

63
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:38,959
well can be transported a long way without being damaged or spoiled. That so the customer doesn't end

64
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:44,239
up with a dog's dinner, an informal expression meaning something messy or badly done.

65
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:49,759
Recent developments like high quality restaurant meals being delivered by bike are shapers of

66
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,399
modern eating. Things that have a strong influence on how a situation develops.

67
00:05:54,399 --> 00:06:00,240
All of which means that cooking may soon become just a hobby. An activity someone does in their

68
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,839
spare time for pleasure or relaxation. For example cycling. Or learning English.

69
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,639
That's all we have time for today. Happy cooking and goodbye for now. Bye!
