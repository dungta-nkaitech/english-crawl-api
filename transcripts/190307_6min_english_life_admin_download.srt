00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,320
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,800
I'm Neil and joining me. It's Rob.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,280
Hello. Now Rob, would you say you're someone who's quite organised?

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,719
Oh, I'd like to think so.

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:24,960
What's the best way to organise everything?

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,879
You need a to-do list, a list of all the jobs you need to do

11
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:30,559
that you can work your way through.

12
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:35,439
That's a good idea and something we can include in today's discussion about life admin.

13
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:40,239
Admin is short for administration that describes the activities and tasks you have to do

14
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,280
to make a business or organisation run smoothly.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,879
But life admin is administration you have to do to make your day-to-day life run smoothly,

16
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,280
like doing housework or paying a bill.

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,519
And the first thing on my to-do list is to ask you and the listeners a question.

18
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:57,599
Hmm, yes, you wouldn't want to forget that.

19
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,120
So, the website Hotels.com commissioned some research

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,960
about how much time young adults that's millennials spend doing life admin.

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,760
Do you know what proportion of their free time they spend doing life admin tasks?

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,519
Is it a quarter of a day?

23
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:14,879
B, a third of a day.

24
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:16,560
C, half a day.

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,640
Based on my personal experience, I would say about a quarter of a day.

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,400
Well, we'll see if you're the same as other people at the end of the programme.

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,040
But as we all know, life admin is necessary, but it can be a bit of a chore.

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,920
A boring, ordinary task you do regularly.

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,440
Experts have studied the subject and looked at how we do it and how we can make it less boring.

30
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,800
One of them is Elizabeth Emmons, Professor of Law at Columbia University and author of

31
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,400
the Art of Life Admin.

32
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,400
She's been speaking to the BBC Radio 4 programme Woman's Hour and described what she thought life admin is.

33
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,160
Life admin is the office work of life.

34
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,440
It's the invisible layer of work that is the kind of thing that managers and secretaries,

35
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:06,719
aka admins do for pay in the office, but that everyone does in their own lives for free.

36
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,360
She calls life admin the invisible layer of work.

37
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,560
So it's work, tasks or chores we carry out that people don't notice we're doing or don't

38
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,159
realise we have to do them.

39
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,080
It's extra work in our life.

40
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,560
And we don't get paid for it unless we're at work when it is the role of someone to do it,

41
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,080
such as secretaries or aka admins.

42
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,360
aka is short for also known as.

43
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,439
So secretaries might also be known as admins, that is short for people who do administration.

44
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,360
Right, so we know life admin is boring and we don't get paid for it.

45
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,120
And also trying to renew your house insurance or trying to query a bill with a utility company

46
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,000
can be frustrating and feels like a waste of time.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,640
A utility company by the way is one that supplies something such as electricity,

48
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,400
gas or water to the public.

49
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,159
My problem is I never get around to doing my life admin.

50
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,360
There are better things to do.

51
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,599
So you could say I procrastinate.

52
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,599
I delay doing things until later, probably because I don't want to do them.

53
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,439
You are what Elizabeth classifies as an admin avoider.

54
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,400
So this is where my to do list comes in handy, Neil.

55
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,760
You have a written record of tasks that can be quite satisfying to cross off as you do them.

56
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,480
This is something Elizabeth M. has found to work, at least for some people.

57
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,080
Let's hear from her again.

58
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,560
What type of people that you find get most satisfaction from completing a to do list?

59
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,000
If you've ever made a list and put things on it that you've already done just to cross them out,

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,200
then you know the kind of done it pleasure that goes with that.

61
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,480
But actually I interviewed people, especially the superdoers that I interviewed,

62
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,359
actually confined real pleasure in the actual doing of it.

63
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:51,280
And so trying to understand how we can get to that when we have to do it,

64
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,759
how we can make it so that there is some meaning in it and some texture and the ways of doing it

65
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,639
that please us.

66
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,560
So she was describing the superdoers.

67
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,519
These are the people who love admin and would spend an evening putting their book collection

68
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,959
into alphabetical order.

69
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,560
Elizabeth mentioned that we should learn from the superdoers and get some done it pleasure in

70
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,600
doing our life admin. We need to find a meaning for doing it. In other words, what it represents

71
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,800
so we can see the benefit of completing our to do list.

72
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,360
How we find pleasure from doing life admin is different for different people.

73
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,879
So personally I think I'll stick with being an admin avoider.

74
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,560
But that might explain why I just got charged extra for not paying my credit card bill on time.

75
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,199
Well, please don't avoid giving us the answer to the quiz question you asked us earlier.

76
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,360
Yes. Earlier I asked researchers commissioned by Hotels.com

77
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:52,000
pulled 2000 young professionals about their lives. How much of their free time do they spend

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
doing life admin? Is it a quarter of a day, b a third of a day, c half a day?

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,240
And I said a quarter of a day.

80
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,199
Yes, they spend a quarter of their days carrying out tasks like doctor's appointments waiting

81
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,240
in for packages to be delivered and doing household chores.

82
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,279
Boring. Unlike this program, Neil, which is not a chore.

83
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,079
One of the words we discussed today. Yes, our vocabulary today included chore,

84
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,719
a boring ordinary task you do regularly.

85
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:26,560
We also mentioned admin, short for administration. The activities and tasks you have to do to make

86
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,919
a business organization or just your life run smoothly. We heard a.k.a meaning also known as,

87
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,600
for example, Rob a.k.a the master of six minute English.

88
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,640
Oh, thanks very much Neil. Next we heard utility company. That's a company that supplies

89
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:48,640
something such as electricity, gas or water to the public. And we also heard how Neil likes to

90
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:54,319
procrastinate. That's delay doing things until later, probably because he doesn't want to do them.

91
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,360
Finally, we mentioned super duers and informal terms to describe people who get satisfaction

92
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,439
out of doing life admin and do lots of it. Like me.

93
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:09,040
Well, it's time to go now, but there's plenty more to discover on our website at BBCLearningEnglish.com.

94
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,240
Goodbye for now. Bye-bye.
