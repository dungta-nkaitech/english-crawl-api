00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:12,160
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,879
And I'm Beth. Neil, do you remember the children's television show, Lassie?

4
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:22,559
Oh yes, of course. The show's hero was a dog named Lassie and Lassie went round helping

5
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:28,080
people in trouble. Yes, well, if you watched Lassie as a child, you might also remember

6
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:34,320
the TV shows Flip of the Dolphin and Skippy the Kangaroo. The stars of these shows were animals

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,960
who would also come to the rescue of humans in trouble. In this programme, we'll be discussing

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,159
some real-life animals helping people in trouble. It might sound strange, but we'll be hearing

9
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:50,480
how cows are helping to stop fires in Spain. Well, now I have a picture in my head of a cow

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,759
wearing a fireman's helmet. But I guess that's not what you mean, Neil. Not quite Beth, but you're

11
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:02,719
right about the fires or wildfires to be exact. Wildfires are unplanned fires in areas like forests

12
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,719
or grasslands which spread out of control. They often happen in hot dry countries like Spain.

13
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:15,280
So how could cows help? We'll be finding out and learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

14
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,640
And remember, if you like to read along as you listen to the programme, you'll find a script on our

15
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:27,599
website, BBCLearningEnglish.com. But now I have a question for you, Beth. Some wildfires are

16
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:33,280
caused naturally, but most are the result of human activity. So according to the Natural History

17
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,079
Museum of Utah, what proportion of wildfires is caused by people? Is it A, 2 out of every 5,

18
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:49,040
B, 3 out of every 5, or C, 4 out of every 5? I'm going to guess 3 out of every 5, I think.

19
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,080
Let's find out at the end of the programme. Thanks to increasing temperatures caused by

20
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:00,400
climate change, the wildfires happening today are more intense and more destructive than ever before.

21
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,600
Here Craig Langren, reporter for BBC World Service Programme, People Fixing the World,

22
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,000
discusses the problem with Pablo Shapiro of rewilding Spain, an organisation combating wildfires

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,280
in central Spain. One of the reasons for this is that the forests have been left to grow on checks,

24
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,319
as the simply aren't enough animals to feed on all the trees, bushes and grass. And the more

25
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,400
dense this vegetation is, the more likely it is to catch fire. What we had before in our ecosystems

26
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,000
here in Europe, is that we had big grises. We had the envisons, we had autos, we had wild horses,

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,080
and now they are gone from the ecosystem because of extinction, domestication.

28
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:45,759
Many European forests have grown unchecked. If something is left unchecked, nobody controls it or

29
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:51,599
prevents it from increasing. The problem is that when trees, grass and vegetation are left to grow,

30
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,879
they're more likely to catch fire. Hundreds of years ago, animals known as grazers

31
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,560
would simply have eaten this vegetation up. To graze means to eat grass and other wild plants,

32
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,039
and grazers are the animals, including horses, cows and goats which do this. In English, you can

33
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:14,319
also say a person is grazing if they continually eat snacks or little bites of food.

34
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,319
But in modern times, numbers of grazing animals have declined sharply because of extinction,

35
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,639
when a species of animal, the dinosaurs, for example, no longer exist, and domestication,

36
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:33,840
when wild animals are controlled by humans to work or for food. And as numbers of grazing wild

37
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,560
animals decrease, forests and grasslands continue to grow unchecked, leading to the large wildfires

38
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:47,120
regularly happening in Spain. And that's where our four-legged friends, the cows, come to the rescue.

39
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,560
Supported by rewilding Spain, Pablo has reintroduced herds of Taurus, the species of cows similar to

40
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,719
the now extinct wild orrocks, the ancestor of the modern domestic cow, into the forest's

41
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,840
substantial Spain. Here's reporter Craig Langeron again for BBC World Service Programme,

42
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,159
fixing the world. Along with the cows' voracious appetite, they trample on the vegetation,

43
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,639
and it's that trampling that helps to open up the forest, so it's not so densely packed

44
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:24,079
full of flammable vegetation. Taurus eats everything from grass and leaves to tree branches and bark,

45
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:31,040
Craig says the cows are voracious, or very eager for lots of food. What's more, by wondering

46
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,800
freely around the forest, they trample down dead trees, reducing the amount of flammable,

47
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,400
meaning easily burnt, vegetation. They don't wear firemen's helmets, but these four-legged

48
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,080
fire-fighting friends are really coming to the rescue in Spain. Okay, Neil, isn't it time to

49
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,640
reveal the answer to your question? Yes, I asked you what proportion of wildfires are caused by people.

50
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,599
And I said three out of five, was I right? I'm afraid you're wrong, Beth. The answer was C,

51
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:07,439
according to the Natural History Museum of Utah, four out of every five wildfires are manmade.

52
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,319
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this programme, starting with the adjective

53
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:18,479
unchecked. If something harmful is left unchecked, nobody controls it or prevents it from growing.

54
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:25,040
So, graze means to eat grass and vegetation. Graces are animals like cows which do this,

55
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:31,360
and a person who grazes continually eats little bites of food. Extinction is when an animal species

56
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,600
no longer exists, the dinosaurs and the wild orrocks are two examples of extinct animals.

57
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,920
Domestication is when wild animals become controlled by humans for work, food or as pets.

58
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:49,199
The adjective voracious means very eager for something, especially a lot of food.

59
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,600
And finally, if something is flammable, it easily burns or catches fire. Once again,
