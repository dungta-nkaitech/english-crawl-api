5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,880
Hello and welcome to 6Mooch English. I'm Alice.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,000
And I'm Neil.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,280
What are you eating, Neil?

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,280
It's a chocolate chip muffin.

9
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,679
How many calories do you think it contains?

10
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:23,039
I have no idea.

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,400
It checks the packet.

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,400
It's hard to find the calorie content amongst all the other information here.

13
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:29,679
Err...

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,719
Oh, here we go.

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:31,759
450.

16
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:33,039
That's a lot.

17
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,560
Are you sure you should be eating that?

18
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,439
Why not?

19
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,640
I expect I cycled off quite a few calories on the way to work.

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,960
Well, that depends on the length of your journey

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,920
and how much energy you expended or used up.

22
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,119
Now, on today's show, we're talking about food

23
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,239
and the exercise it takes to burn off calories.

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,480
And I have a question for you, Neil.

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,519
How long would you have to walk to burn off the calories

26
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:57,920
in a quarter of a large pizza?

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,760
Is it A33 minutes, B53 minutes, or C83 minutes?

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,719
Err... I'll go for A33 minutes.

29
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,760
That sounds quite enough considering if you got the whole pizza,

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,400
it would mean walking for 132 minutes to burn off or use the calories.

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,840
And that's over two hours.

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,400
Well, we'll find out later on whether you got the answer right or not, Neil.

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,439
But be warned, people are bad at estimating how many calories there are in food.

34
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,959
Now, the Royal Society for Public Health here in the UK

35
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,799
is concerned that people don't read the information on food packaging

36
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,959
because the text is so dense, it means tightly packed.

37
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,719
Well, I never look at food labeling when I'm shopping for food. How about you, Alice?

38
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,599
Well, personally, I like to make an informed choice

39
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,759
about what I put in my body, Neil.

40
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,079
And informed means based on an understanding of the facts.

41
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,799
So I spend a lot of time reading the packaging.

42
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,239
And I think the current traffic lights are a great idea.

43
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:58,879
Traffic lights? What are you talking about?

44
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,439
Well, it's where food content is colour-coded red, orange or green,

45
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,560
like traffic lights, depending on its percentage of fat, sugar and salt.

46
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,120
So you can see at a glance which pizza on the supermarket shelf is better for you.

47
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,919
This helps the consumer to make an informed choice.

48
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,519
To see at a glance means to understand something immediately.

49
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,000
Well, my informed choice is based on which pizza has the most pepperoni on it.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,160
I had no idea food companies were putting traffic lights on their food packaging.

51
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,240
Yes, and that's not all, Neil.

52
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,520
There are now plans to put an icon or simple picture of someone running

53
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,920
plus the time it would take to burn off the calories contained in a particular food item

54
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,879
on the front of the packaging. Let's hear what some consumers on the streets of London

55
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,320
thought about this idea.

56
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:54,959
I would think twice about buying crisps if I have to run 19 minutes just to burn the calories I ate.

57
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,560
I'd either consider working out those 19 minutes or not eating the crisps at all.

58
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:07,840
Two people who would think twice about whether to buy crisps if they knew how long it would take

59
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,680
to burn off the calories.

60
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,840
And think twice means to think carefully about doing something before you do it.

61
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,120
But to be honest, I want freedom to do what I feel like, even if they put a label on the food,

62
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,680
I think I'd exercise if I wanted to exercise.

63
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,840
But I think I'd still have a packet of crisps if I wanted a packet of crisps.

64
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,480
That's fine. So long as you are clear about how active you need to be to eat what you do and not put on weight.

65
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,560
But a healthy diet isn't just about calories, is it?

66
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,840
I wouldn't need a cycle to work to burn off a diet cola,

67
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,879
but drinking a fresh orange juice would be a healthier choice even though it contains more calories.

68
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,719
Well, that's a good point. Let's listen now to Shirley Kramer, Chief Executive at the Royal Society

69
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,120
for Public Health, talking about why she thinks the new labeling is necessary.

70
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,599
We've got 60% of the UK population either overweight or obese.

71
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,800
We have a very, very urgent problem. We have a growing population literally.

72
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,080
And we need to have a lot of tools in our toolbox, a lot of new strategies, I think,

73
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,520
in order to support people to make good choices.

74
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,160
Shirley Kramer of the Royal Society of Public Health.

75
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,000
So she says we need lots of tools or strategies to help tackle obesity in the UK.

76
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,560
And linking energy content in food to physical activity is just one tool in the toolbox, so to speak.

77
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,720
Indeed. Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question, Neil.

78
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,199
I asked you how long would you have to walk to burn off the calories in a quarter of a large pizza?

79
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,680
Is it a 33 minutes, b 53 minutes or c 83 minutes?

80
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,920
And I said a 33 minutes.

81
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,720
And you underestimated, I'm afraid, Neil.

82
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,759
The answer is c 83 minutes.

83
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,039
This figure comes from Shirley Kramer, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health.

84
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,839
Writing in the British Medical Journal, she argues that food should be labelled with the

85
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:15,120
equivalent exercise needed to burn off its calories. This would give consumers an immediate

86
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,039
link between foods, energy content and physical activity that might help to reduce obesity.

87
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,719
Note Alice that I've put my muffin to one side. You've convinced me to eat more healthily.

88
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:29,039
And I'll be eating a green salad for lunch.

89
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,920
No, I'll believe that when I see it, Neil.

90
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,760
Okay, here are the words we learnt today. Expended.

91
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:38,000
Burn off.

92
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,319
Dense.

93
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,800
Informed.

94
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,520
See it a glance.

95
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:47,920
Icon.

96
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,400
Think twice.

97
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:52,400
Tool.
