from BBCLearningEnglish.com

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,880
Hello, I'm Catherine.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,399
Hello, I'm Rob.

7
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:21,440
We both started with what is probably the best known greeting in English

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,600
and one of the first words English language students learn.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,839
And that is Hello!

10
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:34,079
So, today in 6Nate English, we're digging a little deeper into the world of greetings

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,920
and the fascinating history of Hello!

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,840
Surprisingly, the word Hello is not as old as you might think,

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,560
but when did it first appear in print in English?

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,960
Was it A in the 1890s, B the 1950s or C the 1890s?

15
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:57,679
Well, I think English changes really quickly, so I'm going to say B the 1950s.

16
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,960
And we'll say Hello again to Hello, a little later in the programme.

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,400
First greetings.

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,200
They can be a bit of a minefield, a subject full of unpredictable difficulties.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,120
While in many places a handshake or a bow is normal,

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,799
there's also the tricky question of kisses and hugs.

21
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,719
Orcward, should you kiss?

22
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,159
How many times?

23
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,560
And should your lips touch their cheek?

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,960
No, Rob, definitely an air kiss.

25
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,159
Close to the cheek, but don't touch much safer.

26
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,959
Greetings are the subject of a new book by former British diplomat Andy Scott,

27
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,119
called One Kiss or Two in search of the perfect greeting.

28
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,079
Here he is on the BBC Radio Show Word of Mouth.

29
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,919
Why greetings so important?

30
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,759
In these are the first moments of interaction we have with people,

31
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,399
and it's in those first moments and using those little verbal and physical rituals

32
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,560
that we have and we can get in such a muddle about,

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,000
that we're kind of recognising each other, we're reaffirming our bonds,

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,640
we're even testing our bonds and our relationships with each other.

35
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,840
We're signalling our intentions towards each other,

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,040
despite the fact we might not necessarily be conscious when we're doing them.

37
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,000
Scott says we need to communicate our intentions to each other

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and acknowledge our relationships.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,920
Well, that's what greetings do.

40
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,560
One word he uses to mean relationship or connection is bond.

41
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,000
We can reaffirm our bonds, which means we confirm them

42
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,280
and make them stronger.

43
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,159
And we do it through rituals, patterns of behaviour that we do for a particular purpose.

44
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,240
So there are the phrases such as,

45
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,000
hello, good afternoon, nice to meet you,

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,479
and as well as the physical rituals, handshakes, bows and kisses.

47
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,240
Though he also said we sometimes want to test our bonds,

48
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,360
we might want to check if our friendship has grown by offering something warm with unusual,

49
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,120
like a hug instead of a handshake.

50
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,640
Now Scott acknowledges how difficult greetings can be

51
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,000
using the very British slang phrase to get in a model.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,039
If you get in a model, you become confused or lost.

53
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,719
You might get in a model if one person expects two kisses,

54
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,319
another expects only one.

55
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,080
Though Scott does believe that the details don't really matter,

56
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,879
because another important purpose of greetings is to reduce tension.

57
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,280
So if you get it wrong, just laugh about it.

58
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,840
Okay, let's get back to the one word we really shouldn't get in a model about.

59
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,719
Hello.

60
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,199
Let's listen to Dr Laura Wright, a linguist from Cambridge University,

61
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,759
also speaking on the BBC Word of Mouth Radio programme.

62
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,520
Where does hello come from?

63
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,800
It starts as a distant hailing, I see you miles over there and I've got to yell at you.

64
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,560
It's not until the invention of telephones that we really get to use hello

65
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,240
is greeting to each other and even then it wasn't initially used as greeting.

66
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,759
It was used more as an attention-grabbing device.

67
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,719
You are miles away, the line is about to be cut.

68
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,439
I need to attract the attention of the operator as well.

69
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,159
So everybody would call hello to each other as this long distance greeting form.

70
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,360
Laura says hello hasn't always meant hello.

71
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,240
Originally it was just a shout to attract someone's attention.

72
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,360
And we call this kind of shouting hailing.

73
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,360
The shout would vary in form.

74
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,079
It could sound like a hollow or a hello-ah.

75
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,720
We continued this kind of hailing when telephones first appeared.

76
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,759
People would keep repeating hello, hello while they were waiting to be connected.

77
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,639
And before long this became the actual way to greet somebody on the telephone.

78
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,879
Anyway, before we say goodbye to hello,

79
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:47,199
let's have the answer to today's question.

80
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,639
I asked when the word hello first appeared in print in English.

81
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,800
According to the Oxford English Dictionary, it was in 1826.

82
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,560
Other spellings appeared before that.

83
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,360
You see, I was thinking English changes really quickly, but not that quickly.

84
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,319
Not that quickly.

85
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,399
So before we go, let's have a look at today's vocabulary again.

86
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:12,240
A minefield is something that's full of uncertainty and even danger.

87
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,000
This sense comes from the literal meaning of field full of explosive landmines.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,800
And then we had air kiss, which is when you kiss the air beside someone's face

89
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,560
instead of the face itself, like this.

90
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,360
Mwah.

91
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,240
And we had bond, a connection.

92
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,720
There's a close bond between us, I think, Rob.

93
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,800
Which is good because when I get in a model, you're always very understanding.

94
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,600
Yeah.

95
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,560
To get in a model means to become confused.

96
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,160
Ritual was another word.

97
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,000
Rituals are certain behaviors that people perform in certain contexts.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,839
I have a morning ritual.

99
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:52,079
Brush Mati, the breakfast I didn't say it was an interesting Rob ritual Rob.

100
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,280
No, that's true.

101
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,759
Finally, to hail is to greet someone loudly, especially from a distance.

102
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,720
I hailed my friend when I saw her at the airport.

103
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,800
And that's it for this programme.

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,719
Bye.

107
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:11,679
Bye-bye.
