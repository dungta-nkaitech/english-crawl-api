Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Neil.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,559
And I'm Sam, still working from home, as you can hear.

5
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,240
But for many, the return to the office has begun.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,679
And to make things safe, new thermal cameras are being installed in some workplaces,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,159
they measure body temperature to screen for coronavirus.

8
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:40,799
After weeks of working at home, the return to the office is slowly getting underway in a number of

9
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:46,159
countries. But workplaces are having to change in this coronavirus era.

10
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:52,079
Lots of companies are rushing to install technology to make offices and workplaces safer.

11
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:59,280
Sensors that monitor our movements, smartphone apps that alert us if we get too close to workmates,

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,840
and even devices that take our temperature could all become the new normal.

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,760
That's a phrase we hear a lot these days, meaning a previously unfamiliar situation that has

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,079
become usual and expected. In this programme, we'll take a look at how this technology works,

15
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,840
and ask if it really is the answer we're looking for.

16
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,599
But first, today's quiz question. The thermal cameras I mentioned screen for coronavirus

17
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:31,039
by recording skin temperature in the area of the body, which most closely resembles the

18
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:39,839
internal body temperature. But which area is that? Is it A, the I, B, the ear, or see the nose?

19
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:42,079
I'll say A, the I.

20
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,959
Okay, Sam. We'll find out later if you were right.

21
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:51,599
Now, as employees slowly return to work, tech companies are busy finding ways for them to do so

22
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:58,319
safely. One such company, MicroShare, is managed by Charles Pomell. He spoke to the BBC World

23
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,000
Service programme TechTent to explain a possible solution.

24
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,039
So the technology that we are offering is using Bluetooth wristbands or tags that people are

25
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,919
wearing within the workplace, which detects proximity events. When the proximity event has been

26
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:20,639
recorded, it's been saved by the company in case they need to further down the line, retrace the

27
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,759
steps of a certain person who has been declared as infected and inform anyone else they may have

28
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:33,359
been in contact with. One important way to control coronavirus involves contact tracing. This means

29
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:38,879
that someone who tests positive for the disease informs everyone else they've been in contact with.

30
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:45,759
MicroShare's system for this uses Bluetooth. Technology that allows computers, mobile phones and

31
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,639
other devices to communicate with each other without being connected by wires.

32
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:58,239
Employees wear Bluetooth wristbands, which register when workers come into close proximity.

33
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,399
How nearer person is to another person. Anyone who has been close to a workmate will then know

34
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:10,639
they have to take action if that person is found to have coronavirus later down the line in the future.

35
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:16,000
Wearing wristbands, monitoring data on smartphones and being recorded by cameras,

36
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,719
it all feels like quite a big invasion of privacy, doesn't it?

37
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:27,039
It certainly does. And although some argue that such measures are necessary in these unprecedented

38
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,879
times, others are worried about the possible consequences. Here's human rights lawyer Ravie

39
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,799
Nyke with a warning. From a human rights perspective, you have to try to ask, are you trying to use

40
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,680
tech for tech's sake? Is this actually going to facilitate an understanding of who is safe to go

41
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,880
back to work or not? And if not, what's the necessity of this? Because it's such a significant

42
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,320
interference with basic human rights, there has to be a high level of evidential justification

43
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,040
to deploy this type of technologies. And I just don't think it's there.

44
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,920
Ravie questions whether these devices will actually help identify who can return to work,

45
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:09,519
whether the technology is being used for its own sake. An expression meaning doing something

46
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,359
because it is interesting and enjoyable, not because you need to.

47
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:19,199
Ravie's work as a lawyer involves finding proof that something is right or wrong.

48
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,519
If people's human rights are being interfered with, he thinks there has to be evidential

49
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:32,480
justification. Explanation of the reasons why something is the right thing to do based on evidence.

50
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,120
Like the evidence from screening body temperature. Which brings us back to today's quiz question.

51
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,800
Remember I asked you which part of the body is scanned by thermal cameras to measure body temperature?

52
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,040
And I said A, the eye. And you were absolutely right.

53
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,920
There's a small area of the eye close to the tear ducts, which is the most accurate part of the

54
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,680
skin for measuring body temperature. Oh well there you go. We've been discussing how thermal

55
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,400
cameras and other workplace devices being used to prevent coronavirus are becoming the new normal,

56
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,879
a previously unfamiliar situation that is becoming normalized.

57
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:18,960
Some of these devices are wristbands with Bluetooth technology allowing computers and smartphones

58
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,879
to communicate remotely without wires. They can identify work colleagues who have been in close

59
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:30,319
proximity in other words near to each other. That will be helpful if one of them tests positive

60
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,519
for coronavirus further down the line at some point in the future.

61
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,719
The coronavirus pandemic has caused massive changes in workplaces around the world,

62
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:46,639
but some critics are concerned that contact tracing technology is being used for its own sake

63
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,519
because it's interesting and enjoyable to do rather than being absolutely necessary.

64
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:57,600
And since much of the new tech invades personal privacy, it should only be introduced with

65
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,160
evidential justification. Explanation of why it is the right thing to do based on evidence.

66
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,160
Unfortunately that's all we've got time for, but remember to join us again. Bye for now. Bye.
