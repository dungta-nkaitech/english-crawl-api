00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,880
Hello, this is 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,080
And I'm Georgina.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,280
Georgina, what do you do to cheer yourself up?

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,960
Having a walk usually helps, especially if it's in the countryside.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,560
Yes, being in all the green open space can certainly help us relax and de-stress.

10
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,839
Getting back to nature can be a tonic when you're feeling down.

11
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,039
A tonic is something that makes you feel happier and healthier.

12
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:37,039
I'll drink to that. Me too.

13
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:42,560
But connecting with the natural world is particularly beneficial to people with mental health issues,

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,640
such as clinical depression.

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,079
And it's something that's being called eco-therapy.

16
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,320
More on that in a moment, but here's our question for you to answer, Georgina.

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,079
Okay, Neil, far away.

18
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,239
Well, seeing or even hugging trees is a form of therapy.

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,400
But how high is the world's tallest tree thought to be?

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:12,799
Is it 65.8 metres, 115.8 metres, or 185.8 metres, Georgina? Any ideas?

21
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,000
Not a clue, but let's go for the highest figure of 185.8 metres.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,120
Are you sure? Well, we'll have to wait until the end of the programme to find out.

23
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,960
The mental health charity Mind describes eco-therapy as a formal type of treatment,

24
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,160
which involves doing outdoor activities in nature.

25
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,880
However, there's not one simple definition.

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,400
It just relates to doing activities outdoors.

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,200
Yes, it can involve doing many things, such as outdoor yoga or horticulture,

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,040
another name for gardening.

29
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,280
It doesn't involve taking medication,

30
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,040
but instead it just develops a person's relationship with nature.

31
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,000
It's something Patricia Hasbach knows a lot about.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,880
She's a clinical psychotherapist and told the BBC Radio programme Health Check

33
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,040
how eco-therapy can help.

34
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,280
Does she say it can help everyone?

35
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:13,439
I often think about eco-therapy as another tool in the therapist's toolbox.

36
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:19,200
It's not a panacea, it's not going to erase somebody's pain or grief,

37
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,479
but it is a powerful tool.

38
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:27,679
Traditionally, therapy has stopped at the urban boundary.

39
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,000
So it's interesting that she describes eco-therapy as a tool,

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,039
something that can be used to achieve something else.

41
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,879
Here, it can be used to help improve someone's mental health.

42
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,319
But she says it's not a panacea, so not something that will solve everything.

43
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,120
It won't erase or get rid of someone's pain,

44
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,079
but going beyond what she calls the urban boundary

45
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:56,560
and into the natural world means there's another method for helping people.

46
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,319
Now, as we've mentioned, eco-therapy can take many forms,

47
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,479
doing art in a forest or running on a beach are all therapeutic.

48
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:07,439
They're things that make you feel better or healthier.

49
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,000
Well, I think that's clear, but what is it about the outdoors that affects us?

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,359
A good question, Georgina.

51
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,680
It seems from research that our busy brains are always on guard,

52
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,320
but when we get into nature, it gets a break.

53
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,920
There's not so much to be on the lookout for, and we can relax.

54
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,840
Well, it does seem the negative symptoms of urban life can benefit from a dose of nature.

55
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,520
A dose is an amount of something.

56
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,960
Let's get a good explanation from an expert.

57
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,240
Environmental psychologist, Bugita Gardes-Leban,

58
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,240
also spoke to the BBC Health Check programme and gave two reasons.

59
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,680
One of them she explained was something called biofilia.

60
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,960
Biofilia, very briefly, is really innate, positive response that people have

61
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,080
with life and life-like features.

62
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:05,280
The idea that nature reminds us of life, and if we are exposed to natural elements,

63
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,600
then our sort of negative feelings get almost immediately replaced with positive

64
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:12,319
emotions.

65
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:20,319
Bugita Gardes-Leban, they're explaining biofilia, which is a passion for or empathy with

66
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,800
the natural world and living things.

67
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,680
She said biofilia is innate, which means it's a quality that you're born with.

68
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,199
So basically, most of us were born to connect with nature.

69
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,040
Nature reminds us of life and gives us good, positive emotions.

70
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,079
Naturally.

71
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,959
Okay, well Georgina, maybe getting today's quiz question right will give you

72
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:46,719
positive emotions. Earlier, I asked you how high the world's tallest tree is thought to be.

73
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:57,199
Is it a 65.8 meters, b 115.8 meters, or c 185.8 meters? What did you say?

74
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,560
I said c 185.8 meters.

75
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,479
Oh dear. I'm afraid that's far too high.

76
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,879
The correct answer is 115.8 meters. Never mind.

77
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:15,520
The tree named Hyperion is a type of redwood and was found in California in 2006.

78
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,240
Well, that's still very tall and would be great to see.

79
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,840
Now, we've just got time to recap some of the vocabulary we've discussed,

80
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,560
starting with tonic, which can be a fizzy drink,

81
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,240
humics with an alcoholic drink, but in the context of therapy,

82
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,520
it can mean something that makes you feel happier and healthier.

83
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:37,359
Horticulture is the study or activity of growing garden plants. In other words, gardening.

84
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:40,639
A panacea is something believed to solve everything.

85
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,479
If something is therapeutic, it makes you feel better or healthier.

86
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,639
We also discussed biofilia, which is a passion for or empathy with the natural world and living things.

87
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,799
And innate means a quality that you naturally have, you're born with it.

88
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:58,560
Well, as you know, I have an innate quality for presenting this program,

89
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,040
but now it's time to go. Please join us next time and don't forget to check us out on your

90
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,399

91
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,480
Goodbye. Bye.
