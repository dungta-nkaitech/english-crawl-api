From BBC Learning English

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,919
Hello, this is 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,120
And I'm Sam.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,679
Sam, do you remember the first time you voted?

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,400
No, I don't, but I remember being very keen to do it.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,080
It would have been the first election after my 18th birthday.

10
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,000
So over the many, many, many years since then.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,119
Not so much with the many, if you don't mind, Neil.

12
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,960
OK, in the very, very few years since then.

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,320
Yeah, that's more like it.

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,479
In the years since then, have your political views changed very much?

15
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,719
I think my political views are a lot better in forms now.

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,640
I think the decisions I make are based on a better understanding

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,159
of the political situation,

18
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,039
but I still generally agree with the same things I did when I was younger, I think.

19
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,959
There is a belief that as we get older,

20
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:04,640
we become more right-wing in our political views and opinions.

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,039
Is this true? And if so, why?

22
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:10,479
We'll be finding out a little bit more about this, but first a question.

23
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:15,920
What was the first UK general election in which 18-year-olds could vote?

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,120
Was it A, 1929, B, 1950, or C, 1970?

25
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,120
So when you reckon then, Sam?

26
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,439
Well, they were all before my time.

27
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,960
I'm going to say 1950, that sounds about right.

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,240
It was the decade in which teenagers were invented after all.

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,359
OK, well, I will reveal the answer later in the programme.

30
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,320
James Tilley is a professor of politics at the University of Oxford.

31
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,719
He appeared recently on BBC Radio 4's programme Analysis,

32
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,360
and was asked why, if it is true,

33
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,320
do we become more right-wing as we get older?

34
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,760
What does he think?

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,400
The question where the age effects are political views is a tricky one.

36
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,640
I think probably the most plausible explanation

37
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,320
is that people just generally become a bit more resistant to changes to get older,

38
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,600
and I think also that it tends to perhaps become less idealistic.

39
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,760
So what reasons does he give?

40
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,159
Well, he talks about what he thinks are the most plausible explanations.

41
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,120
Plausable is an adjective, which means something is believable.

42
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,759
It's reasonable, and it makes sense.

43
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,799
And what are the plausible explanations?

44
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:25,759
Well, he says that generally, as we get older,

45
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,319
we like to have more stability in our lives.

46
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,679
We don't like change.

47
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:31,840
In fact, we're resistant to change.

48
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,639
That means we're against change.

49
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,799
When we are younger, we might like the idea of revolution.

50
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:40,479
We might be very idealistic.

51
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:47,359
This means, for example, we might think that we can and should change the world to make things better.

52
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,200
This would cause big changes in the world, which when we are older and more settled in our lives,

53
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,520
do not seem like such a good idea.

54
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,040
Let's listen again.

55
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,520
The question where the age effects are political views is a tricky one.

56
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,840
I think probably the most plausible explanation

57
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,440
is that people just generally become a bit more resistant to changes to get older,

58
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,320
and I think also that it tends perhaps become less idealistic.

59
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,560
Professor Tilly goes on to explain more about why being resistant to change might lead people

60
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,199
to support more right-wing policies.

61
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:24,879
So if parties on the right represent a platform which is perhaps more favorable to the status quo,

62
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,960
it's perhaps more about pragmatism than it is about idealism,

63
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,159
then that might be more attractive to older people than younger people.

64
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,159
So what is seen as the appeal of moving to the right?

65
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:41,439
Political parties have a particular set of policies.

66
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,920
This is sometimes known as their platform.

67
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:48,959
Professor Tilly says that if their platforms support the status quo,

68
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,679
they might be more attractive to older people.

69
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:58,719
The status quo is a Latin phrase we use in English to refer to the situation as it is now,

70
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,119
that is one that is not going to change.

71
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:08,000
Traditionally, it's parties of the centre right that seem to be more supportive of the status quo.

72
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,119
So as we get older, he says our political views are less about idealism

73
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,160
and more about pragmatism. Pragmatism is being practical and realistic

74
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,360
about what can be achieved and how it can be achieved.

75
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,720
But of course this doesn't apply to everyone and just because people seem to move more to the right

76
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,199
as they get older doesn't mean that they completely change their politics.

77
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,360
Let's hear Professor Tilly again.

78
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,040
So if parties on the right represent a platform which is perhaps more favorable to the status quo,

79
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,120
it's perhaps more about pragmatism than it is about idealism,

80
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,400
then that might be more attractive to older people than younger people.

81
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,240
Right, let's get the answer to our question.

82
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,560
What was the first UK general election in which 18-year-olds could vote?

83
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,680
Was it A1929, B1950 or C1970? Sam, what did you say?

84
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,759
I thought it was 1950.

85
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,000
Well, you're wrong, I'm afraid.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,800
The correct answer is 1970.

87
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:14,800
18-year-olds have been allowed to vote in the UK since 1969 and the first general election after

88
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,720
that was in 1970. So a bit later than you thought, Sam.

89
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,680
But congratulations to anyone who did get that right.

90
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,199
Okay, let's remind ourselves of our vocabulary.

91
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,400
Yes, first we had plausible an adjective that means believable or possible.

92
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,160
Being resistant to something means you are against it and don't want it to happen.

93
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,520
If you're idealistic, you have a clear and simple moral view of how things should be.

94
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,960
This contrasts with one of our other words, pragmatism.

95
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,240
This noun is the idea of being realistic and practical about what can be achieved.

96
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,120
A platform can describe the policies and ideas of a political party or politician

97
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,400
and the status quo is the unchanging situation as it is now.

98
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,080
Okay, thank you, Sam. That's all from us in this program. Do join us again.

99
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,519
And if you can't wait, you can find lots more BBC Learning English online on social media and on our app.

100
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,879
Goodbye. Bye.
