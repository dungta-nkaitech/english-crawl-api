From BBC Learning English

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,879
Hello, this is 6 Minute English and I'm Catherine.

6
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:17,839
And I'm Sam.

7
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:20,320
No, Sam, have you been watching the World Cup?

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,679
Quick it or football?

9
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:23,839
Because they're both being played at the moment.

10
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,480
There they are now, I'm talking about football,

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,160
the Women's World Cup.

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,320
In that case, yes, I have.

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,320
I've really enjoyed it and it's been great that finally we can watch

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,799
the matches live on TV and that there's been so much interest in the media.

15
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,960
We'll be finding out a little bit more about the history of women's football

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,879
in England in today's programme.

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,760
But first, Sam, a question for you.

18
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:55,280
When was the first official women's football world cup?

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,359
Was it a 1970?

20
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,280
B1988 or C1991?

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,640
What do you think, Sam?

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,519
Well, I think I can get this through mathematics rather than knowledge.

23
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,439
So I'm not going to say it right now, but I'll tell you later.

24
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,200
Okay, well, I'll tell you the answer later in the programme.

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Now, Jermic Locke is a writer on women's football in England

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,519
and she spoke recently on the BBC Women's Hour programme.

27
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,599
Here she describes the reaction throughout the years to women's football.

28
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,560
Has it been easy for the women's game in England?

29
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,439
Women's football has really been a struggle to play,

30
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,120
to have any kind of agency and to be taken seriously as athletes.

31
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,719
That can be seen throughout history.

32
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,159
I think every moment that women's football has had,

33
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,000
there's been a backlash afterwards or a kind of attempt to keep women back

34
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,680
and to dampen enthusiasm for the sport.

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,680
So it's not been easy, has it?

36
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,239
No, she said it's been a struggle,

37
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,760
which means it's been difficult to make any progress.

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,159
And she also mentioned that there was no agency in the women's game.

39
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:15,199
To have agency means you have control over your own situation.

40
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,599
You can make the decisions you want to make.

41
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,800
So she's saying that the women's game didn't really have control over its own future.

42
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,040
Every time they had some success, there was a backlash.

43
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,000
There was a negative reaction to their success.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,600
That's right, and she goes on to say that people tried to dampen enthusiasm for the sport.

45
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,360
They tried to make it difficult to see and enjoy it.

46
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,520
So who tried to dampen enthusiasm and how do they do it?

47
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,120
Well, during that after the First World War, women's football became really popular with crowds of

48
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,160
up to 50,000 watching games.

49
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:58,560
It may have been popular with the crowds, but it wasn't so popular with the men who ran the game.

50
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,800
The English Football Association.

51
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:02,800
Here's Gemma Clock again.

52
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,960
The Men's Football Association were panicked by seeing women doing so well,

53
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,919
and they banned all women from playing football on association grounds,

54
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,000
and that lasted for about 50 years.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,719
It was a very concerted effort to keep women's football amateur status

56
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,919
and ensure that there weren't crowds watching them play.

57
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,960
So the men were really worried by the success of the women's game.

58
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,199
They thought it might take money and supporters away from the men's game.

59
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,199
So they banned women from playing on their pitches.

60
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,199
This means that they no longer allowed them to use the pitches anymore.

61
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,199
This effectively killed the professional women's game.

62
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,960
As up to then, they'd been using the same facilities as the men.

63
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,599
This, she says, was a concerted effort to restrict women's football.

64
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:00,719
When you make a concerted effort to do something, it means that you try really hard to do it.

65
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,760
I'm pleased to say that the ban on women using football association pitches was eventually lifted,

66
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,920
although only comparatively recently in 1971.

67
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,800
Right, before we review today's vocabulary, let's have the answer to today's question.

68
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:21,120
So I asked you, Sam, when was the first official women's world cup?

69
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,879
Was it a 1970 B1988 or C1991?

70
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,080
And you said, Sam, you were going to work this out with maths.

71
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,040
So come on then.

72
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,080
I know. I did.

73
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,920
So I know the World Cup has held every four years.

74
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,680
It's 2019 now.

75
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,680
So the answer must be an odd year, very with me, which makes it 1991.

76
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,319
Am I right?

77
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:50,000
Right, well, we'll see if the mathematical approach is any better than you actually just knowing the answer.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,240
The first World Cup for women was actually held in.

79
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,439
Oh, come on, hurry up.

80
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,680
Levin and my riddy.

81
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,360
19.

82
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,480
Oh no.

83
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,120
70.

84
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,519
Oh, I can't believe I got that wrong.

85
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,639
But it wasn't an official tournament.

86
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,680
The first official women's World Cup was indeed 1990.

87
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,120
Yay, it's a...

88
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,560
Your maths words.

89
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,400
So where does Sam and everybody else who got that right?

90
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,920
Now, before we get to extra time and penalties, let's recap today's vocabulary.

91
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,120
A struggle is how you can describe something that is very difficult to achieve,

92
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,800
something you have to fight for.

93
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,800
To have agency means being able to act independently and have control over your own choices.

94
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,240
A backlash is a strong negative reaction to something.

95
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,160
If you try to damp an enthusiasm for something, you try to make people less interested in it.

96
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,600
Banging something means using certain powers to stop something from happening.

97
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,759
And finally, making a concerted effort means trying really hard.

98
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,560
Well, the final whistle has blown for us today.

99
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,759
We'll see you again soon and don't forget to look out for more from the BBC Learning English team

100
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,800
online on social media and on our app.

101
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,079
Bye for now. Bye!
