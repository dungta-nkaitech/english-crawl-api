00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,199
And I'm Beth. Are you a tea or coffee drinker, Neil?

4
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,600
Well, I usually drink a cup of coffee in the morning. How about you, Beth?

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,600
I'm definitely a tea drinker. There's nothing like a good cup at a start the day.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,600
Yes, a kappa. It's a word in British English, meaning a cup of tea, right?

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,600
But there are many different types of tea. Which tea do you like?

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,600
Well, I usually drink English breakfast tea in the morning and then a matcha tea at lunch

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,600
and then maybe a calming herbal tea before bed.

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,600
Wow, it sounds like you're a real tea addict, Beth. So you'll love this programme

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,600
because we're discussing an exciting drink called bubble tea.

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,600
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Great. But first, I have a question for you, Neil.

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,599
Today, British supermarkets sell almost twice as much coffee as tea.

15
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:13,599
And consumer surveys have found that a majority of rits prefer drinking coffee.

16
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:20,599
So what proportion of rits do you think still regularly drink tea?

17
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:27,599
Is it A, 39%, B, 49%, or C, 59%.

18
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:33,599
Well, let me think about that. I'm going to say B, 49%.

19
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,599
Okay, Neil. I will reveal the answer at the end of the programme.

20
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:44,599
People have been drinking tea for centuries, but that doesn't mean tea drinking hasn't changed over the years.

21
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:53,599
Here in Britain, new trends such as iced tea and green matcha tea have become as popular as the traditional English cuppa.

22
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,599
Which, as everyone knows, is black tea with a splash of milk.

23
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,599
One of the latest tea trends is pearl milk tea, also called bubble tea.

24
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:11,599
But if you've never heard of it, don't worry. Here's presenter Ben Henderson explaining more for BBC World Service programme witness history.

25
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:20,599
For those who don't know, pearl milk tea or bubble tea is tea usually mixed with milk, crushed ice and filled with its signature chewy tapioca balls.

26
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:25,599
But customers can then add whatever flavours they want. It's innovative and exciting.

27
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:35,599
Pearl milk tea, or bubble tea, as it's often called, was invented in 1987 by Taiwanese tea shop owner Liu Hanqia.

28
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:42,599
The bubbles in a glass of bubble tea are made from balls of a chewy starch called tapioca.

29
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:48,599
Food which is chewy needs to be chewed a lot before it becomes soft enough to swallow.

30
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:56,599
It's these tapioca balls which give bubble tea its name. You might say their bubble tea's signature ingredient.

31
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:04,599
Their special feature for which something is particularly known. For example, paella is the signature dish of Spain.

32
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:15,599
What's more, because tapioca doesn't have a strong taste, different flavours can be added, making bubble tea an innovative meaning new and original drink.

33
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:24,599
Liu Hanqia's invention was inspired by a trip to Japan, where he saw people enjoying iced milk tea on a hot summer's day.

34
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:32,599
When he added tapioca balls, which he found in a local market on his return to Taiwan, the bubbly new beverage was born.

35
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:42,599
But it was only when famous international celebrities, including basketball player Michael Jordan and movie star Jackie Chan, started visiting his tea shop.

36
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,599
That Liu Hanqia's bubble tea began a revolution in the tea drinking world.

37
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,599
Here is Liu Hanqia telling more to BBC World Service program, witness history.

38
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,599
So, I do something.

39
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:08,599
ProMuketi got huge media coverage and it spread like wildfire. But I always say, we have many other products and the reason ProMuketi became so popular was pure luck. It was a miracle.

40
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:16,600
Thanks to its celebrity fans, Liu Hanqia's bubble tea became an international bestseller.

41
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:25,600
A news of his exciting new drink spread like wildfire. An idea meaning it became quickly known by many people.

42
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:36,600
As more and more people tried it and fell in love with its smooth chewy taste, bubble tea spread to neighbouring countries like South Korea and China and then to the rest of the world.

43
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:43,600
For Liu Hanqia, it was a miracle, a very lucky event that is surprising and unexpected.

44
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:52,600
It's great to hear about something that gives a modern twist to a drink that's part of a country's traditional culture. Maybe that's what we need here in Britain too.

45
00:04:52,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Yes, your question was about the fact that nowadays, more people in Britain prefer coffee than tea. I think it's time you revealed the answer.

46
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Right, I asked you what percent of Brits still regularly prefer drinking tea over coffee and you said 49% which was the wrong answer I'm afraid, Neil.

47
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:22,600
In fact, around 59% of Brits still regularly drink tea. Maybe it's time for a bubble tea revolution over here.

48
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt in this programme starting with kappa and informal word in British English for a cup of tea.

49
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,600
The word signature describes a special feature for which something is particularly known.

50
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,600
If food is chewy, it needs to be chewed a lot before it's soft enough to swallow.

51
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,600
The adjective innovative means new and original.

52
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,600
If something spreads like wildfire, it becomes quickly known by more and more people.

53
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,600
And finally, a miracle is a very lucky event that is surprising and unexpected.

54
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Once again, our six minutes are up, but remember to join us again next time for more topical discussion and useful vocabulary here at 6 Minute English.

55
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Goodbye for now.

56
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Bye!
