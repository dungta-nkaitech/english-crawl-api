6 Minute English from the BBC.

10
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,119
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

11
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:43,119
I'm Neil.

12
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:44,640
And I'm Sam.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,599
In recent years, many people have wanted to find out more about where they come from.

14
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:54,079
Millions have tried to trace their family history and discover how their ancestors lived

15
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,000
hundreds of years ago.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,159
The internet has made it much easier to find historical documents and records about your

17
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,799
family history.

18
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:08,040
And one of the most useful documents for doing this is the census.

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,519
A census is an official count of all the people living in a country.

20
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:18,319
It collects information about a country's population and is usually carried out by the government.

21
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:24,240
In Britain, a census has been carried out every ten years since 1801.

22
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:31,399
In 2002, when census records from 100 years before became available online, so many people

23
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:36,199
rushed to their computers to access them that the website crashed.

24
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:40,840
But before we find out more about the census and its related vocabulary, it's time for

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,319
a quiz question, Sam.

26
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:48,519
Someone who knows a lot about his family history is British actor Danny Dyer.

27
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:53,840
When BBC Television programme, who do you think you are, researched his family history,

28
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,560
they discovered that the actor was related to someone very famous.

29
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,880
But who was it?

30
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,040
A. King Edward III.

31
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,079
B. William Shakespeare.

32
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,920
Or C. Winston Churchill.

33
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,680
Well, I know Danny Dyer usually plays tough guy characters.

34
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,800
So maybe it's C. War Hero Winston Churchill.

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,560
Okay, Sam, we'll find out later if that's correct.

36
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,439
Now, although the first British census took place in 1801, other censuses have a much

37
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,079
longer history.

38
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:30,000
In fact, the Bible story of Mary and Joseph travelling to Bethlehem is linked to a Roman

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,319
census.

40
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:37,879
So, what was the original reason for counting people and what did governments hope to achieve

41
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:38,879
by doing so?

42
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:45,039
Here's Dr. Catherine Levitan, author of a book on the Cultural History of the Census,

43
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,919
speaking to BBC World Service programme The Forum.

44
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,199
I think there were probably two most common reasons.

45
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:58,639
One was in order to figure out who could fight in war, so basically military conscription.

46
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,079
And in order to find out who could fight in wars, ancient governments like the Roman

47
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:07,119
Empire had to find out how many men of a certain age there were.

48
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:11,000
And I would say that the other thing that was that censuses were most commonly used for

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,679
was for purposes of taxation.

50
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,200
According to Catherine Levitan, ancient censuses were used to figure out or understand how

51
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,200
many men were available to fight wars.

52
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,800
The Roman Empire needed a strong army, and this depended on conscription, forcing people

53
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,360
to become soldiers and join the army.

54
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,840
The other main reason for taking a census was taxation.

55
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,680
The system of taxing people a certain amount of money to be paid to the government for public

56
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,400
services.

57
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,879
The ancient and early modern censuses were large and difficult to organize projects.

58
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:53,400
They often involved government officials going from house to house, asking questions about

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,759
the people who lived there.

60
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:01,120
But over time, governments desire to know about and control its citizens gave rise to new

61
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,759
technologies for counting people.

62
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,560
Here's statistician and economist Andrew Whitby explaining how this happened in the

63
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,520
US to BBC World Service Programme, the forum.

64
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,920
The 1890 census of the United States was the first in which some kind of electro-mechanical

65
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,639
process was used to count people.

66
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:25,439
So instead of just armies of clerks reading off census schedules and kind of tabulating

67
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,279
these things by hand, for the first time an individual census record would be punched

68
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,560
onto a card so that there were kind of holes in this card representing different characteristics

69
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
of the person.

70
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:43,560
Old-fashioned censuses were managed by clerks, office workers whose job involved keeping records.

71
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,560
Thousands of clerks would record the information gathered in the census and tabulate it.

72
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,560
In other words, show the information in the form of a table with rows and columns.

73
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:02,560
The US census of 1890 was the first to use machines and many censuses today are electronically

74
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,560
updated to record new trends and shifts in populations as they happen.

75
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,560
In fact, so much personal information is now freely available through social media and

76
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,560
the internet that some people have questioned the need for having a census at all.

77
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,560
Yes, it isn't hard to find out about someone famous like a TV star.

78
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,560
Someone like Danny Dyer you mean?

79
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,560
Right, in my quiz question I asked Sam which historical figure TV actor Danny Dyer was related to?

80
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,560
I said it was C Winston Churchill was I right?

81
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,279
It was a good guess Sam but the actual answer was A King Edward III and no one was more

82
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,560
surprised that he was related to royalty than the EastEnders actor himself.

83
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,639
Okay Neil, let's recap the vocabulary from this program about the census, the official

84
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,639
counting of a nation's population.

85
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,639
To figure something out means to understand it.

86
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,639
The Romans used conscription to force men to join the army by law.

87
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,639
Taxation is the government system of taxing people to pay for public services.

88
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:15,639
A clerk is an office worker whose job involves keeping records.

89
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:21,639
And tabulate means show information in the form of a table with rows and columns.

90
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:28,639
That's all for our six minute look at the census but if we westerd your appetite for more why not check out the whole episode.

91
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,639
It's available now on the website of BBC World Service Programme the Forum.

92
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,639
Bye for now.

93
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,639
Bye bye.
