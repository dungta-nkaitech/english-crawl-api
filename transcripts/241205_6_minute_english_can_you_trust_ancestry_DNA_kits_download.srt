00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,919
Hello, this is 6-Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:13,439
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,760
Nowadays, it's popular to find out more about your family history

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,039
by tracing your family tree, a diagram that shows all the members of a family

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,320
over a long period of time. What do you know about your family history, Beth?

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:35,439
Well, my mum actually did our family tree. She found a lot of ancestors had emigrated to

8
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:40,560
the United States, but yeah, I don't know much more than that. What about you?

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:48,400
Well, I'm lucky to have an unusual surname, so it's quite easy to trace my ancestors,

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:55,039
and somebody in my family has gone back to 1700 and found somebody with my name.

11
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,399
Wow, that's amazing. Well, the internet has made it easier to find the historical records

12
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,400
needed to research your ancestry, the origins of your family. But what if you want to find out

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,400
about a time before historical records began? Luckily, some companies now offer to trace your

14
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,840
ancestry using DNA. DNA is the cellular information that's passed down from parents to children,

15
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:27,040
telling the body how to create life. Listener Chris from the UK recently took a DNA ancestry test.

16
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,640
When the test returns some unexpected results, Chris called BBC Radio 4 program sliced bread,

17
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,920
wondering how accurate they really were. Not so long ago, I sent off a home DNA testing kit,

18
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,480
and the results that came back were broadly in line with expectations, but they had some

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,079
little glitches in there, which made me think, is this accurate, or is it, to be taken with a pinch

20
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,760
of salt? Chris wondered whether his results were accurate, or whether to take them with a pinch of

21
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:06,800
salt, an idiom meaning to doubt something is completely true. So in this program, we'll discuss how

22
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:13,840
accurate DNA ancestry tracing is, and as usual, we'll learn some useful new words and phrases,

23
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,640
and remember you can find all the vocabulary for this program on our website, BBCLearningEnglish.com.

24
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,439
First though, I have a question for you Beth. One reason to be cautious about DNA ancestry tests

25
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:34,240
is that humans are very similar to each other. Most of your DNA is identical with every other person

26
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:40,159
on Earth, and it's only the tiny amount of difference that accounts for all genetic variations

27
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:49,759
between humans. So, exactly how much DNA do humans share with each other? Is it a 79.9%

28
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:58,560
b 89.9% or c 99.9%? I am going to guess 99.9%

29
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,159
Okay, well we'll find out the answer later in the program.

30
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:08,479
Another problem for research based on DNA is agreeing on the meaning of words like

31
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:14,959
ancestry and ethnicity. Here, genealogist Louise Bulldog explains the difference between

32
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:21,599
these words to BBC Radio 4 program sliced bread. So ancestry is really about people, it's about

33
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:28,399
your actual four bears, your ethnicity, we would probably think of in geographical terms, maybe

34
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:36,000
which continent or which region your people came from. Like ancestors, the term four bears means

35
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,479
actual people, the relatives in your family from a long time ago. But Louise is more interested in

36
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:48,400
the term ethnicity, the shared culture, language and traditions of a group of people,

37
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,680
and this is closely connected to a geographical location. And it's this question of geography,

38
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,479
which interested BBC presenter Greg Futt. Greg sent DNA samples to two different companies.

39
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,120
The results from the first company matched what he already knew about his family,

40
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,640
that the past five generations came from England. But listen to what happens when Louise Bulldog

41
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,360
revealed the results of Greg's second DNA test on his BBC Radio 4 show sliced bread.

42
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,519
It's going to blow your mind. Okay. Can I tell you what you're looking at?

43
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:30,079
Yes, please do. It says that you are first of all 66% north and west Europe, but explicitly that

44
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,719
doesn't refer to the United Kingdom. Okay, so why is geographical area?

45
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:41,759
27.5% Irish, Scottish and Welsh, but again explicitly not English.

46
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:49,199
The second company's DNA test blows Greg's mind. It makes him very excited and surprised.

47
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,519
There's no evidence of his ancestors being English at all.

48
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:59,360
Actually, companies compare DNA with other samples in their database. And since companies use

49
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,080
different databases, it's not too surprising that Greg's results were so different.

50
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,840
Unlike his actual DNA. Speaking of which, what was the answer to your question, Neil?

51
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:17,360
I asked you what percentage of human DNA is shared by everyone? And what was your answer, Beth?

52
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,080
I said 99.9%. Well, you must be very clever because the answer is correct. Well done.

53
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,560
Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned starting with family tree, a diagram showing all

54
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,639
the members of a family. Ancestry refers to the origins of a family. If you take something with a

55
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,959
pinch of salt, you don't believe it's completely true. Four bears are relatives who lived in the past.

56
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:48,879
Ethnicity means the social, cultural and linguistic characteristics shared by a group of people.

57
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,159
And finally, if something blows your mind, it makes you excited or surprised.

58
00:05:54,159 --> 00:06:00,000
Once again, our six minutes are up. But why not head over to the BBC Learning English website

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,120
where you'll find a worksheet and quiz, especially for this programme. See you there soon.

60
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,600
Goodbye.
