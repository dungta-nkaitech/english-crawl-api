Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,760
And I'm Sam.

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,359
People collect all kinds of things for a hobby, from stamps and coins to comics and football stickers.

5
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,800
Do you collect anything, Sam?

6
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,560
I used to have a big collection of Pokemon cards, but I have no idea where they are now.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,880
Well, maybe you should start looking for them because all kinds of collectibles,

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,679
that's objects that people want to collect, are selling for big money on the internet.

9
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:45,359
It's all part of a new tech craze called non-fundable tokens or NFTs for short.

10
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:47,120
Non-fundable tokens?

11
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,679
Basically, NFTs are unique one of a kind items that can be bought and sold like any physical object,

12
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,399
but only exist in the digital world.

13
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,359
Tokens can be thought of as certificates of ownership for these virtual possessions.

14
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,760
Hmm, okay. I understand the token part, but what does non-fundable mean?

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,480
If something is fungible, it can be interchanged, like money, for example.

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,680
With money, you can swap a £10 note for two £5 notes and it will have the same value.

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,560
Ah, so something non-fundable cannot be interchanged with something else.

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,240
Is that because it has special features that make it unique?

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,159
Exactly. Imagine something totally unique like the Mona Lisa.

20
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,200
You can take a photo of the painting or buy a copy of it,

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,480
but there will only ever be the one original painting.

22
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,359
Ah, I can see that the Mona Lisa is one of a kind and extremely valuable,

23
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,840
but it's not for sale on the internet.

24
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,200
True, but lots of other things are from signed celebrity artwork to virtual football cards.

25
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,000
NFTs are like autographed photos.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,480
Collectors want something no one else has,

27
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,760
even though there's nothing physical they actually own and keep.

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,120
And the value of NFTs is going up and up?

29
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,320
Massively. A digital sticker of French footballer,

30
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,640
Kilian and Bappe recently sold for £25,000,

31
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,120
which reminds me of my quiz question, Sam.

32
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,840
In June 2021, Satin Berners-Lee sold the original source code he used to invent the Worldwide Web,

33
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,400
as an NFT at a charity auction.

34
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,439
The sale started at $1,000, but how much did the source code eventually sell for?

35
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,319
Was it a $5,4,000?

36
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,199
B $5,4 million? Or C $5,4 billion?

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,840
If you're asking me how much the internet sold for,

38
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,599
I'd say C $5,4 billion.

39
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,159
Okay, Sam will find out later if that's right.

40
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,039
Satin Berners-Lee famously never made any money from the Worldwide Web,

41
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,319
insisting that his invention should be free for everyone.

42
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,199
But the world of NFTs is controversial,

43
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,719
and not everyone thinks Satin should be getting involved.

44
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,960
That's certainly the view of Shona Gosh,

45
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,519
technology editor at the insider website,

46
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,560
as she told BBC World Service Programme TechTent.

47
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,560
I think there's a balance to be struck between exploring new technologies,

48
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,319
and Satin Berners-Lee is an amazing figure.

49
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,640
But NFTs are a Wild West,

50
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,039
not everything associated with NFTs are rogue,

51
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,719
but these so-called digital collectibles are going for lots of money.

52
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,719
Internet NFTs are very new, and there are no rules controlling what can be sold

53
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,240
and for how much.

54
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,840
So Shona describes them as a Wild West.

55
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,759
The Wild West means a situation where people can do whatever they want,

56
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,840
because there are no laws or controls,

57
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,120
like the early history of the western part of the United States.

58
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,000
She also calls some things about NFTs,

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,479
rogue, behaving differently from what's normal or expected,

60
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,719
often in a way that causes damage.

61
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:59,840
Love them or hate them, there are strong opinions on both sides of the NFT debate,

62
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,959
as Rory Ketlin Jones, presenter of the BBC World Services TechTent, explains.

63
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,000
To some NFTs are a brilliant innovation,

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,600
which is promised to put a value on those digital artifacts,

65
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,879
to others they're little more than a dubious pyramid scheme,

66
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,120
with a damaging impact on the environment,

67
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,519
because of the way the tokens are created.

68
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,160
Some people are suspicious of the large amounts of money collectors are willing to pay,

69
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,280
comparing NFTs to pyramid schemes.

70
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,560
Business tricks or scams, where money is obtained dishonestly.

71
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,560
But for others, NFTs are a legitimate and useful way to put a price on rare digital artifacts.

72
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,399
Items such as images, videos, and music that are produced and stored as electronic versions.

73
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,560
Items like, for example, the original source code for the internet.

74
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,519
So how much money did Satim Bernas-Lee raise for charity when he sold it off, Neil?

75
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,639
In my quiz question, I asked Sam how much the NFT for the original internet source code

76
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,160
sold for at auction.

77
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,520
And I said, see, $5.4 billion.

78
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,000
You were wrong. In fact, it was less, $5.4 million,

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,480
but still far too expensive for me to collect.

80
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,840
Now I'm wondering how much my Pokemon card collection would sell for,

81
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,680
if only I could find it.

82
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,080
Well, while you look for your collection, Sam, let's recap the vocabulary from this program,

83
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,280
all about NFTs, which are digital artifacts,

84
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,040
or items that are produced and stored as electronic versions.

85
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:33,200
NFTs are virtual collectibles, desirable objects that people search for and collect.

86
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,439
And they are non-fundable, meaning they have special and unique characteristics

87
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,920
that cannot be interchanged with anything else.

88
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,120
If something is a rogue, it behaves in a different way from what's normal or expected,

89
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,960
often causing damage.

90
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,360
The Wild West describes a chaotic situation without laws or controls.

91
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,879
And finally, a pyramid scheme is a business scam where money is gained dishonestly.

92
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,680
If you'd like to know more about non-fundable tokens, Bitcoin and other trending internet

93
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,480
topics, there's plenty to find on the BBC website.

94
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,680
And for more interesting conversation and useful vocabulary,

95
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,680
remember to join us again soon.

96
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,160
Here at 6 Minute English. Bye for now.

97
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
Bye.
