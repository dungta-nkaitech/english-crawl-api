3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,280
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,519
and I'm Phil

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,120
and now that we've done our hellos

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,000
let's hear some greetings in different languages from around the world

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,760
but what do these languages have in common?

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,760
Gassi

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,719
D

10
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,240
David is...

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,760
Jumaloma nesengai

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,960
Julein Lee

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,960
Pisa Berke, Kimakola, El Tec

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,399
I'm afraid I don't know what they have in common because I don't recognise any of them.

15
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:43,399
Well, sadly the one thing you're not in these languages is that they're all endangered.

16
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:46,679
We often hear about animals at risk of extinction

17
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:51,640
but a recent study by the Australian National University found that out of the world

18
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,600
7,000 existing languages

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,240
half are under threat.

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,079
But what could be done to save languages from dying out?

21
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,400
That's what we'll be discussing in this programme

22
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,280
and as usual we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

23
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,760
But first I have a question for you Phil

24
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:16,840
and it's about a country which used to be one of the most linguistically rich places on earth.

25
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,960
Australia

26
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,400
before European settlers arrived in the 1800s

27
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,439
Australia had over 200 languages spoken by the native Aboriginal people

28
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:29,319
who had lived there for thousands of years.

29
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:35,400
Many Aboriginal languages were destroyed by the brutal laws of the Australian government at the time

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,319
however some survived.

31
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:42,519
So which of the following Aboriginal languages is still spoken today?

32
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:48,920
Is it a, Jinang, B, Alawa or C, Gagado?

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,680
Mmm, I'll guess it's Jinang.

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,359
Okay Phil, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

35
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:01,480
The sad truth is that it was no accident that the Aboriginal languages died out

36
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,519
given the cruel treatment of Aboriginal people.

37
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:07,719
Children were removed from their mothers and sent to schools

38
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:10,120
thousands of miles away to learn English

39
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,319
and even today Aboriginal communities experience racism and poverty.

40
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,360
Another Aboriginal language, Bangala,

41
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,920
officially died in 1960 when its last native speaker,

42
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,879
Elder Mooney Davis passed away.

43
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:31,879
But Bangala has been brought back to life and today it's spoken between parents and children

44
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,799
and even learned in school.

45
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:39,000
So how did a dead language with no living speakers come back to life?

46
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:45,159
The unusual answer involves addictionery and a professor of linguistics.

47
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:51,719
Here's professor Gilad Zuckerman telling his story for BBC World Service programme people fixing the world.

48
00:02:51,719 --> 00:03:04,039
I had a dictionary written by German Lutheran Christian missionary in 1844.

49
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:10,520
His name was Klamor Wilhelm Schuhmann and he wrote the dictionary with

50
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,159
up to 3,500 words which is a lot because he wanted to

51
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,079
Christianise the quotation marks heathens.

52
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:29,400
So it's a topsy turvy writing the wrong of the past by using a tool written for one goal

53
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,800
in order to achieve the diametrically opposite goal.

54
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:41,400
Professor Zuckerman found an English to Bangala dictionary written in 1844 by a German missionary,

55
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,479
a person sent to a foreign country to teach their religion to the people living there.

56
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:52,280
Christian missionaries use the dictionary to teach English to what they called aboriginal heathens.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,959
Heathen is an old fashioned word for someone who belongs to no religion or to a religion that is

58
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:03,319
not Christianity, Judaism or Islam.

59
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:07,719
Professor Zuckerman puts the words heathen in quotation marks.

60
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,919
The phrase in quotation marks is used to show the actual words someone else has written or said,

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,120
but here the phrase is used ironically.

62
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,919
Professor Zuckerman is questioning the real meaning of the word heathens.

63
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,479
He is signaling that he doesn't think aboriginals are heathens at all,

64
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:32,279
a bit like adding a wink at the end of a sentence so people know you're not serious.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,519
What's ironic is that Professor Zuckerman used the missionary's dictionary not to spread

66
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:43,560
Christianity in English but to save an aboriginal language from extinction.

67
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:48,600
So he calls it topsy turvy, meaning upside down.

68
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,879
Professor Zuckerman also says he is writing the wrongs of the past,

69
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:59,800
a phrase which means doing something to correct a historical injustice from the past.

70
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,800
In this case the destruction of aboriginal language and culture.

71
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,800
Speaking your own language is about more than communication.

72
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,560
It means knowing your roots and feeling good about yourself.

73
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,079
I think it's time you reveal the answer to your question Neil.

74
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay well Phil you guessed that Jinang was another living aboriginal language which was

75
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,399
the correct answer.

76
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:27,639
Right let's recap the vocabulary we've learned starting with missionary.

77
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,920
Someone sent to spread their religion to a foreign country.

78
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,759
Heathen is an old fashion name for someone who believes in no religion.

79
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:44,199
The phrase in quotation marks is used to show the actual words spoken or written by someone else.

80
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:51,560
It can also be used ironically to show skepticism, disagreement or belief that a word is misused.

81
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,199
Topsy turvy means upside down or disorganized.

82
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,240
If you write the wrongs of the past you try to correct a historical injustice.

83
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,680
Once again our six minutes are up.

84
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,639
Good bye for now.

85
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,199
Hi.
