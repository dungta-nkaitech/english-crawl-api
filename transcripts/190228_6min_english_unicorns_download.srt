00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,439
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:16,879
And hello, I'm Rob.

7
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,400
Now then, Rob, what do you know about unicorns?

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,719
Ah, well, the unicorn is a fantasy creature from history.

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,600
In our tradition, it looks like a white horse

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,480
with a single spiral horn coming out of its head.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,480
Erm, why do you ask?

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,320
Well, funnily enough, unicorns are the topic of this programme.

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,800
Before we learn more, though, a question.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,039
What do we call the study of legendary creatures,

15
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,640
like the Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot and Unicorns?

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,200
Is it a Crypto-Zoology,

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,960
B. Proto-Zoology or C. Paleo-Zoology?

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,280
Have you got any idea about that, Rob?

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,640
Ah, well, I know this because it was a topic of a 6 Minute English programme

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,359
a while back, in 2008 to be exact.

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,600
So I think I'll keep the answer to myself.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,280
Okay, well, for everyone else, we'll have the answer later in the programme.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,239
Over the last few years, unicorns have been popping up all over the place.

24
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:15,200
On t-shirts, in movies, as toys, and even in political conversations.

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,920
Why is this?

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,040
Natalie Lawrence is a natural historian.

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,439
She appeared on the BBC's Woman's Hour programme to discuss the topic.

28
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,359
Listen out for the answer to this question.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,760
Why does she say people used to drink out of unicorn horns?

30
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,959
Those original stories were developed in a time when magic actually existed in the world.

31
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,120
The world was still very enchanted.

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,120
The idea that unicorns are very strong animal,

33
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,760
and also that could achieve magical feats.

34
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,280
So unicorn horn used to be seen as a panacea for all sorts of

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,680
ills and a guard against poison.

36
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,439
So people used to drink out of unicorn horn cups to prevent themselves getting poisoned.

37
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,640
And I think that idea of it being magical and having magical powers

38
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,399
is still, has still come through today.

39
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:03,759
Why did they drink from unicorn horn cups?

40
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,959
Well, they were supposed to have magical powers,

41
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,680
so people drank from them so they wouldn't get poisoned.

42
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,599
Yes, she said they could perform magical feats.

43
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,120
A feat is something that is difficult to do or achieve,

44
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,520
like recording this programme without making a mistake.

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,479
That's a real feat.

46
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,560
Well, we usually do it.

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,399
It must just be unicorn magic.

48
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,359
No, just the magic of edicing Rob.

49
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:31,359
Now, she also said that unicorn horn was seen as a panacea.

50
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:32,959
What does that mean?

51
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,439
A panacea is another word for a cure.

52
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:39,839
Something that can protect you from illness or help you recover if you're sick.

53
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,759
But is all this true about the unicorn horn?

54
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,599
Well, seeing as how unicorns don't and never have existed,

55
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,439
it's unlikely to be true.

56
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,599
She says these stories come from a time when the world was enchanted.

57
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,879
This means it was a time when people believed in magic

58
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,199
and the possibility of mysterious creatures from mysterious parts of the world.

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,120
It seems as if these days people are looking for a bit of magic,

60
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,960
a bit of enchantment in their lives.

61
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,039
The unicorn has also come to be a term commonly used in politics

62
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,800
to refer to unrealistic ideas and plans.

63
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,919
Why is this?

64
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:17,280
Here's Natalie Lawrence again.

65
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,840
Because it's such a potent cultural symbol at the moment,

66
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,199
it's being deployed in one of the most pressing issues of our time as well.

67
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:34,960
So, and the idea of the UK trying to be its own special unicorn, potentially.

68
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,000
So Rob, what is she talking about here?

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,719
Well, we're in a very complicated time, politically, in the UK at the moment.

70
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,199
She says they are pressing times,

71
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:52,399
a term which means something important but difficult has to be done in a very short time.

72
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,359
A pressing matter is an important one that has to be dealt with urgently.

73
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,679
Now, at the time of recording, our parliament can't agree on the current pressing matter of Brexit,

74
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:06,319
and each side says the other has unicorns.

75
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,159
There's nothing special or magical about these unicorns.

76
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,199
It's a negative comment.

77
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:16,000
A unicorn is a fantasy idea, a plan that has no chance of working.

78
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:22,879
She says unicorns are a potent symbol, which means they're a very strong and recognisable symbol.

79
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,759
And this symbol is being used, or as she said being deployed.

80
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,920
This is the same word that would be used when you send a military force somewhere.

81
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,399
You deploy the army in a military conflict,

82
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,720
and in the current political conflict they are deploying the word unicorn.

83
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,199
Here's Natalie Lawrence again.

84
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,519
Because it's such a potent cultural symbol at the moment,

85
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,399
it's being deployed in one of the most pressing issues of our time as well.

86
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:58,719
And the idea of the UK trying to be its own special unicorn, but potentially.

87
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,480
Right, our pressing matter now is the vocabulary review.

88
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,159
Before that, though, the answer to this week's question.

89
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,760
What do we call the study of legendary creatures like the Loch Ness,

90
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,160
Monster, Bigfoot and Unicorns?

91
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,320
Is it a crypto-zoology, b, proto-zoology, or c, paleo-zoology?

92
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,720
You knew the answer to this, didn't you?

93
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,600
I did. Yes.

94
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,680
If you look back at our archive to September 2008,

95
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,160
you will find an episode all about a crypto-zoology.

96
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,800
Well done.

97
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,840
If you got that right, particularly if you remember that program.

98
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:42,319
Now, vocabulary from this program, there was enchanted to talk about a time when magic was

99
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,679
believed to be real.

100
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:48,879
A feat is something that is very difficult to achieve, and a panacea is a cure.

101
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,679
Something that's potent is strong and powerful.

102
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:54,239
And if you deploy something, you use it.

103
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:56,000
You put it into operation.

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,159
And something pressing is urgent.

105
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,000
It needs to be done soon.

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,839
Right, that's it from us now.

107
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,439
Hope you can join us again soon.

108
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,959
If you can't wait, you can find BBC Learning English on social media,

109
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,120
online, and on our very own app.

110
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,759
Bye for now.

111
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,240
Bye-bye.
