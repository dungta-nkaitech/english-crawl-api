00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,759
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Sophie.

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,320
And I'm Neil. Sophie, did you see the beautiful sky last night?

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,480
No, I went to bed early. Why?

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,240
I was wondering if there was life out there.

8
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,320
You mean life on other planets? That's just science fiction, Neil.

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,799
It isn't. People are fascinated by life on other planets for a good reason.

10
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:36,960
You believe in little green men?

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,920
Not necessarily, but possibly.

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,119
Well, Mars is our closest neighbour in the solar system

13
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:45,759
and the subject of today's show.

14
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:48,719
And that brings me on to our usual quiz question.

15
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,799
How long is a day on Mars?

16
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:55,200
Is it about a five hours, b 25 hours,

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,400
or c 45 hours?

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,480
And I think it must be c 45 hours. Things are weird on other planets.

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,000
And Mars is further from the sun than us.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,400
Mars may be our closest neighbour, but it's hardly in our backyard, is it?

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,040
It is in astronomical terms, Neil. It's visible to the naked eye,

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,280
meaning without using instruments,

23
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,480
and it's reachable by spacecraft.

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,120
Well, we'll find out later on in the show whether you got the answer right or not.

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,359
Now, can you tell me, Neil, why people like you get excited about the possibility of life on Mars?

26
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,640
Well, Mars is similar to Earth in some important ways,

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,719
which means if life developed on our planet, why not Mars?

28
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:47,040
That's true. Its temperature is in the right zone, not too hot and not too cold.

29
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,719
But actually, we could find Mars pretty cold.

30
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:58,959
An average temperature would be around minus 63 degrees Celsius compared to Earth's 14 degrees Celsius.

31
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,760
It's also very arid or dry.

32
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,359
And it needs to be wet for life to develop, doesn't it?

33
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,159
That's right. Many scientists think that liquid water is essential for life,

34
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,079
but there may have been water on the surface of Mars in the past.

35
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:18,719
And recent research suggests that there may be water underground.

36
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's hear some more about this from Professor John Zanecki,

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,800
who teaches space science at the Open University.

38
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,960
We are now seeing that in fact, Mars probably does have water, not liquid water.

39
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,319
There is ice just below the surface,

40
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,159
and there's even just recently tantalising evidence that perhaps water does flow periodically.

41
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,439
Now, and also coupled with the fact that here on Earth,

42
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,560
we're finding that life in very primitive form

43
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,039
exists in the most extreme environments.

44
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,800
These are the so-called extremophiles that exist at the bottom of the ocean,

45
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,640
so life is much, much tougher.

46
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,680
What does tantalising mean, Sophie?

47
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,560
It means something you want that's almost, but not quite, within reach.

48
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,240
So, scientists would love to think water flows on Mars,

49
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,000
but the evidence isn't strong enough for this to be certain.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,879
The other interesting point the Professor makes

51
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,039
is that life makes this in the very harsh Martian environment,

52
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,759
because primitive life exists in extreme places on Earth.

53
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,120
Extremophiles are organisms, or small creatures,

54
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,560
that live in very extreme environments and can survive conditions

55
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,800
that would kill most other organisms.

56
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,359
But on Mars, they would be living underground,

57
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:37,759
because the radiation, or light in heat from the sun,

58
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,039
would kill any organisms living on the surface of the planet.

59
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,039
So, why doesn't the sun's radiation kill us then, Sophie?

60
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:50,239
The Earth has a strong magnetic field created by its hot molten core,

61
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,879
or centre, and this protects us from the sun's harmful solar wind.

62
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,239
And what about Mars?

63
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,639
Why doesn't it have a magnetic field?

64
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,680
It used to, four billion years ago.

65
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,120
It's possible that a massive collision with an asteroid

66
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,359
might have heated up Mars' core, disrupting the magnetic fields.

67
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,520
And if you disrupt a process, you stop it from continuing normally.

68
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,160
Now, to return to the subject of collisions,

69
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,439
Sophie, I have something very interesting to tell you.

70
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,560
Yes.

71
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,080
A meteorite, or a piece of rock from outer space,

72
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,920
might have crashed into the Earth millions of years ago.

73
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,639
That meteorite might have contained

74
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,360
Martian life forms.

75
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,720
So we might be descended from...

76
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,480
Martians.

77
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,879
Well, that's actually an interesting idea, Neil.

78
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,520
But let's listen to Professor John Zanekki

79
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,040
talking about interplanetary life.

80
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,560
If we do find traces of life on Mars,

81
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,840
we don't know, do we, whether it evolved independently,

82
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,520
or was it perhaps seeded from Earth?

83
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,840
It is possible that life forms from Earth,

84
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,080
travel to Mars, and perhaps it existed there, or the other way around.

85
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,240
So, life on Mars may have evolved or developed on its own,

86
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,759
or it might have arrived from Earth in a lump of rock,

87
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,959
or the other way around.

88
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,719
So, Martians might be humans, or we might be Martians,

89
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:19,680
one big interplanetary happy family, Sophie.

90
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,519
Well, Neil, let's hope you stay happy

91
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,799
after you hear the answer to today's quiz question.

92
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:27,759
I asked, how long is a day on Mars?

93
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,759
Is it A, five hours, B, 25 hours, or C, 45 hours?

94
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,319
And I said C, 45 hours.

95
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,079
They must have a long day over there.

96
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,240
And you were wrong.

97
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,120
The correct answer is B, because a day on Mars

98
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,519
is slightly longer than here on Earth.

99
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,519
It's 25 hours.

100
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,120
Anyway, can we at least hear the words we learnt today?

101
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,560
They are the naked eye, arid,

102
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,240
tantalising, extrema files, organisms, radiation,

103
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,040
core, disrupt, meteorite, evolved.

104
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,079
Well, that's the end of today's six minute English.

105
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,840
Join us again soon. Bye-bye.

106
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,360
Goodbye.

107
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,079
