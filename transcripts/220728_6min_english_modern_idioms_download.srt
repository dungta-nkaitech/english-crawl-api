4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,760
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Rob.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,960
And I'm Sam. Can you wait a second, Rob? I have to spend a penny.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,600
What? You're going shopping now, are you?

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,600
Which is about to start the programme?

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,840
No, no, I have to, um, you know, spend a penny.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,320
Haven't you heard that expression before?

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,679
Spend a penny means go to the toilet.

11
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,960
It's an old idiom from the days when it cost a penny

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,359
to unlock the door of a public toilet.

13
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,880
OK, I see. Well, you're showing your age there, Sam.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,920
Most young people today wouldn't know what that phrase meant.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,040
And there aren't many public toilets left nowadays anyway.

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,079
Language changes fast, and new words and phrases

17
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,399
are being created all the time.

18
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,759
In this programme, we'll be learning some modern idioms,

19
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,679
new expressions that have been introduced to English through the internet,

20
00:01:05,679 --> 00:01:07,519
TV and social media.

21
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,159
And of course, we'll be learning their meanings as well.

22
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,079
Great, I am raring to go, another idiom there.

23
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,599
But first, as usual, I have a question for you, Sam.

24
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,719
Many well-known idioms come from the world of sport.

25
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,439
For example, throw in the towel, which means give up or surrender.

26
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,000
But which sport does the idiom throw in the towel come from?

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,400
Is it A, football, B, tennis or C, boxing?

28
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,159
I think I know this one. It's C, boxing.

29
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,599
OK, Sam, I'll reveal the answer at the end of the programme.

30
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:44,479
So just hold your horses for now.

31
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,879
Ah, another idiom thereof.

32
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,959
Hold your horses, meaning stop and think for a moment.

33
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:53,840
That's an idiom that Gareth Carroll might teach

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,840
his university students.

35
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,640
Dr. Carroll is the author of a new book,

36
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,520
Dropping the mic and Jumping the Shark.

37
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,079
Where do modern idioms come from?

38
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,040
He became interested in idioms when he realised

39
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,800
that he didn't know many of the expressions his students used

40
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,640
in their everyday speech.

41
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,120
Modern idioms like Jump the Shark.

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,480
Here is Gareth Carroll telling BBC Radio 4 programme,

43
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,879
Word of Mouth, about one source of many modern idioms.

44
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,799
The movies.

45
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:26,560
So Groundhog Day, I think more or less,

46
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,919
has the meaning of Day Jovoo now.

47
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,319
And it's completely embedded in the language.

48
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,319
Actually, that's probably one of the first phrases

49
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,479
that got me thinking about these modern idioms

50
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:37,519
in the first place because it is so ubiquitous.

51
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,439
It's used in a huge range of context.

52
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,719
And one of the things that kind of made me sit up and take notice

53
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,280
is I had, I had a number of students

54
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,879
who know the phrase Groundhog Day,

55
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,280
but had no idea it was a film.

56
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,359
In the film Groundhog Day,

57
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,080
the main character wakes up to live the same day over and over again.

58
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,240
Gradually, the movie title itself became an idiom.

59
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,600
Groundhog Day, meaning a situation in which events

60
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,320
that have happened before happen again

61
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,320
in exactly the same way.

62
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,040
It's similar in meaning to another expression,

63
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,080
Day Jovoo.

64
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,760
When phrases the movies use develop into idioms,

65
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,480
it's often because they are ubiquitous.

66
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,160
They seem to appear everywhere.

67
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:25,520
And one of the ways they appear everywhere is, of course, the internet.

68
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,439
Here's Gareth Carroll again,

69
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:29,280
telling more to Michael Rosen,

70
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,400
presenter of BBC Radio 4 program Word of Mouse.

71
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,240
The vocabulary of the internet, even the word internet,

72
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,439
is relatively modern.

73
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:40,159
The idea of breaking the internet is now a phrase

74
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,319
that I think people would use and recognise,

75
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,879
so something that causes such a stir online

76
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,919
that metaphorically so many people rush to a website

77
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,919
that it threatens to bring it down.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,919
Something like that early days, we had Goviral,

79
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,679
which has stayed with us, hasn't it?

80
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:55,839
Yes, so the idea of something going viral

81
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:58,639
is certainly very much in the vocabulary now.

82
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:02,319
But things like Twitter have lent phrases,

83
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,719
so the idea of first world problems,

84
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,319
meaning ironically things that we complain about,

85
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,639
but actually compared to other parts of the world

86
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,959
may well be relatively minor.

87
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,199
That started life as a Twitter hashtag, for example.

88
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,759
Another modern idiom is breaking the internet,

89
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,639
causing so much excitement about something online

90
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,000
that too many people visit the website at the same time,

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,279
making it crash.

92
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,879
Social media outlets like Twitter have also created

93
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,120
their own idioms, including first world problems,

94
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,560
a trivial problem that does not seem very important

95
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,039
when compared to the serious problems

96
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:44,079
faced by people in poorer parts of the world.

97
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,879
If you don't know some of these idioms, don't worry.

98
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,719
Unlike general vocabulary,

99
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:51,360
a native speakers' full knowledge of idioms

100
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,600
takes longer to develop, usually at around the age of 30 to 40.

101
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,040
Meanwhile, you can still rely on classic English idioms,

102
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,079
like, for my leg, kick the bucket and throw in the towel,

103
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,240
which I think comes from the sport of boxing, Rob.

104
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,120
Yes, in my question, I asked which sport gave birth

105
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,439
to the phrase throw in the towel,

106
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,519
and Sam's answer was,

107
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:17,439
correct, well done.

108
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,879
The idiom throw in the towel comes from boxing,

109
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:23,680
where the coach of the losing boxer

110
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,039
would literally throw a towel into the ring to surrender.

111
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,799
Okay, let's recap the rest of the idioms, old and new,

112
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:32,319
that we've learnt today.

113
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,919
To spend a penny is an old-fashioned way of saying,

114
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,359
go to the toilet.

115
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:40,639
Groundhog Day describes a situation in which events

116
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,479
that have happened before happen again, exactly the same way.

117
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,480
If something is ubiquitous, it seems to appear everywhere.

118
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,120
The modern idiom break the internet,

119
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,319
means to cause so much excitement about something online

120
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,480
that you can make the website crash.

121
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,520
And finally, a first world problem is a problem

122
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
that does not seem very important

123
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,800
when compared to the serious problems faced by people

124
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,120
in poorer parts of the world.

125
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,800
Unfortunately, for us, our six minutes are up by now.

126
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,000
Bye-bye.

127
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,480
From the BBC.
