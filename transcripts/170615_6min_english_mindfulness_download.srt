5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,240
Okay, I want you to close your eyes.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,480
Focus on your breathing.

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,199
No.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,439
Neil, can we do this later? We've only got six minutes.

9
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:39,600
Okay, Catherine. Welcome to a mindful edition of 6M8 English, where we're exploring the rise of

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,840
mindfulness, particularly in schools. And we'll be teaching six items of vocabulary along the way.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,920
So I think we should start with mindfulness itself.

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,079
Being mindful as an adjective means being calmly aware of everything in your body and mind.

13
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,560
You only focus on now.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:05,120
People practice mindfulness, the noun, by focusing only on their breath and not allowing them's

15
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,879
hose to be distracted by passing thoughts. Indeed, it's traditionally associated with Buddhism and

16
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:16,719
has become incredibly popular in the secular world. It works places in private classes and even

17
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,400
in schools. Succula means non-religious, by the way.

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,319
Okay, I just mentioned schools. How many teachers in the UK are trained to teach mindfulness?

19
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:37,680
Is it a 500, b 5000 or c 50,000? Let me focus really hard. I think it's 5,000.

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,879
A very mindful answer, Catherine, but I'll reveal the real answer later.

21
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:47,839
Now let's hear from one teacher who's been practicing mindfulness with students for many years,

22
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:51,679
Alison Meio, head of early years at Dharma Primary School.

23
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:55,119
Things it's particularly suited to young children. Why?

24
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,759
That's very natural for children to be in the present. And we really kind of celebrate that

25
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,519
because that is a place where they are learning. So if they feel grounded, then they can really

26
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:13,599
develop their concentration and their focus and relax. Learning happens so much

27
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,599
easily if you're relaxed and happy.

28
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,800
Alison said it was natural for children to be in the present.

29
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,840
The present means now. You'll know the term from the present tense in grammar.

30
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:33,840
And people who practice mindfulness use this phrase a lot to be in the present or in the present

31
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,360
moment. It sounds simple, but actually it's very hard to achieve.

32
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,520
Well, Neil, it might be for an old chap like you, but for young people, Miss Meio thinks it's

33
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:49,280
very natural. Fair enough, being grounded, as she says, helps students concentrate and learn

34
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,960
in a relaxed way. Grounded is another good adjective there. It means rational, sensible, clear thinking.

35
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,599
So she's a fan of mindfulness and there's growing evidence behind its benefits.

36
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,840
Yes, the UK's National Health Advisory Body has recommended it to help treat conditions

37
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,840
like depression and anxiety. Studies have shown it reduces levels of the stress hormone cortisol.

38
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,840
And a new study has claimed that eating mindfully can actually help people to lose weight.

39
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,199
You mean eating slowly?

40
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:28,560
Yeah, slowly and really experiencing and tasting the food. Not being distracted and not eating too

41
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,080
much too fast. Anyway, Neil, is mindfulness taking over the world?

42
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,120
Well, not quite yet. There still aren't many detailed studies on it. And some critics say the

43
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,120
studies we have show a publication bias. In other words, only the positive results are published.

44
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,599
A bias is when you support something or someone in an unfair way because of your preferences or

45
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,480
beliefs. What seems certain is that mindfulness has entered into many aspects of modern life,

46
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:02,159
at least here in the UK. Now, let's look back at our question. I asked how many teachers in the UK

47
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,000
have been trained in mindfulness? And I said 5,000. Well, it was actually 5,000.

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,560
Yay! Well done. According to the mindfulness initiative and it keeps on growing.

49
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,519
So before we finish up, here's another question that might be useful for our listeners.

50
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,519
What's the difference between mindfulness and meditation?

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,079
That's not so easy to define. Meditation is the broader term. When you meditate, you spend time

52
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:35,120
quietly, focusing your mind, often for relaxation or spiritual purposes. Mindfulness is a particular

53
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,599
kind of meditation where you try to empty your mind of thought. Does that make sense?

54
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah, more or less. So we'll let our listeners meditate on that answer. And before we empty our

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,120
minds, let's look back at today's words. We had mindfulness, mindful and mindfully.

56
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:59,199
They all relate to the particular practice of being only focused on what's happening now.

57
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,079
What's happening now? Or we could say what's happening in the present. People often focus on the

58
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:10,000
past thinking back about mistakes or happy memories. Or on the future, which can be full of worries.

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,079
But by being in the present, you overcome these thoughts and fears.

60
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:22,079
Next we had secular. It contrasts with religious. So while a church is a religious building,

61
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,160
we also have secular buildings, like factories and shops and hospitals.

62
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,399
All non-religious buildings, in other words. Exactly. Now tell me, Neil, are you feeling grounded right now?

63
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:37,519
You're asking if I'm thinking clearly and feeling connected to the world. Do you even have to ask

64
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,000
Catherine, I'm a very grounded person. You are most of the time. Most of the time you're

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,359
naturally grounded. Every now and again you get a bit panicked, but hey. But some of us need to

66
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:53,599
remember to slow down, chill out and meditate once in a while. Yes, that would be

67
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:59,199
meditate, meaning to take quiet time to focus deeply on something. Exactly. Now for more ways to
