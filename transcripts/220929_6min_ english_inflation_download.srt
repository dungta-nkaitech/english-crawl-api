00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Rob.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And I'm Beth.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In this program we're talking about money. And Beth, as the old saying goes,

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
money makes the world go round.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You mean it's very important and lots of things couldn't happen without it?

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well, we all need money. But have you noticed how our money doesn't seem to buy so much these days?

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes, I have Beth. It seems like consumers like us are being hit in the pocket at the moment.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And by that I mean we have less money to spend.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm no economist, but I know this has a lot to do with inflation.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The increase in prices of things over time.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's a big problem globally. And Beth, my question for you is about inflation.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,000
According to one report, what was the annual inflation rate in Venezuela between November 2017 and 2018?

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Was it a 130%, b1300% or c1300000%?

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'll say b1300%.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Okay, we'll find out if you'll write later on.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But let's talk more about money and inflation now.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Around the world, prices of things are rising more than normal.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And more worrying is that prices keep going up.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Two things in particular are increasing in price. Energy like gas and electricity and food.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
These are things we need and depend on. So what's causing the rises?

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There seem to be two main reasons. The Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine, which has reduced the supply in things we need.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And when things are in short supply, available in limited quantities, prices go up.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The BBC World Service Program, The Real Story, discussed this in much more detail.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
One expert, economist, writer and broadcaster, Linda Yu, explained how price rises could be around for a while.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Even if you take out some of these volatile items like food and energy,

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
the sustained price increases that we've had, it is actually getting passed through into how companies price their goods and services.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And that's where it gets extremely worrying because that suggests that even if energy prices, food prices come down,

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:49,000
we could have inflation now in the system. And I think that for advanced economies is worrying for developing countries that you're hugely worrying.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Linda Yu used some interesting language there. She talked about food and energy being volatile items.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Something that's volatile is unpredictable and can change suddenly.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And that's what we've experienced with food and energy prices.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes, and she said these price increases have been sustained, so continuing at the same level for a long period of time.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But Linda Yu says that even if energy and food prices eventually come down, companies will pass on the extra costs they've already faced by charging more for their goods and services.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And this could cause inflation. There's that word again.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Continuing price rises aren't good for anyone, but especially for people in developing economies, countries which have industry that's less developed and have lower living standards.

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Another possible consequence of inflation is recession.

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This economic term describes a situation where a country's production starts going down. People's incomes go down and unemployment goes up.

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
This all sounds like a very bleak economic outlook. So what can be done?

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Well, that's the million dollar question an economist are trying to work it out.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Speaking on the real story program, economist Vicki Price gave an overview of how to control inflation.

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:24,000
One of the things that actually is most effective is by slowing down demand. And if you increase interest rates, what you do is you discourage people from borrowing, whether they're individuals or whether they are businesses.

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And of course, economists start slowing down.

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So she says what is most effective, meaning what works well and gets the best results, is slowing down demand.

46
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Increasing interest rates can do this because people will borrow less money.

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Interest rates are fees, banks and financial institutions charge you for borrowing money.

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And if we borrow less money, we buy fewer things which can reduce inflation. I think it makes sense now.

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And if you were in Venezuela in 2018, you would really want inflation to go down, wouldn't you?

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh, yes. Now earlier, I asked you what one report said the inflation rate was there between November 2017 and 2018.

51
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And I said a very high 1,300%.

52
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Well, it was even higher, Beth, according to a study by the Opposition Control National Assembly, the annual inflation rate reached 1,300,000% in the 12 months to November 2018.

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This extreme financial situation was known as hyperinflation.

54
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's not good at all. In this program, we have been talking about inflation. That's the increase in prices over time.

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Other vocabulary we used included the expression hit in the pocket, which means you have less money to spend.

56
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Volatile describes something that is unpredictable and can change suddenly.

57
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Something that is sustained continues at the same level for a long period of time.

58
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
And something that is effective works well and gets the best results.

59
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And interest rates are fees, banks and financial institutions charge you for borrowing money.

60
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Well, we hope you found our brief lesson about the economy useful. Thanks for listening. Goodbye for now.

61
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Bye-bye.
