00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,019
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish.

3
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:12,019
I'm Phil.

4
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:13,560
And I'm Georgie.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,320
Has this ever happened to you?

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:21,719
You eat a doughnut and get a sugar rush, a strong feeling of excitement and energy, only

7
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,560
to collapse an hour later with a headache.

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,960
Food affects us more than we realise, and that's because what we eat, halters our brain

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,240
in chemistry, changing our mood and emotions.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,679
Our brain is working 24 hours a day, even while we sleep.

11
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,039
So it needs more fuel than other body parts.

12
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,000
So, can we eat our way to feeling happy?

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,120
In this programme, we'll be discussing the relationship between food and the brain.

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,600
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,120
Sounds great, Georgie.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,520
But first, I have a question for you.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,960
What are the ingredients with an average brain weighing 1.5 kilos are one of the cleverest

18
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,960
animals?

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,480
But which mammal has the biggest brain?

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:16,800
Is it an African elephant, bee, a dolphin or sea, a sperm whale?

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,480
I think it's an African elephant.

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,480
Okay, Georgie.

23
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,879
I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

24
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:29,480
Now, did you know that despite making up only 2% of our total weight, our brain is

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,000
20% of the body's energy.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,159
Nutritionist Dr. Rita Achari does.

27
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,200
She thinks we should be specifically eating four-hour brains.

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,760
As she explained to BBC World Service programme, the food chain.

29
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,040
Eating every day, right?

30
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,120
And eating a balanced diet.

31
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,400
So you get the full complement of vitamins and minerals.

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
It's critical.

33
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:05,440
If you go low in something in one day, if you just don't eat any protein for a day or

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,800
for me in my situation, if I don't eat any vegetables, I know the next day I'm not

35
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,200
a sharp.

36
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,040
Number one on Dr. Achari's list of brain foods is a regular and balanced diet.

37
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,439
A diet containing the proper types and amounts of food needed to stay healthy.

38
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:24,120
Remember the rainbow rule?

39
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,359
Eat foods of many different colours with lots of leafy greens.

40
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:34,000
A balanced diet also includes different types of nutrients, vitamins, fibre, protein and

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
so on.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,199
But including these isn't always possible.

43
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:43,000
You might go low on, meaning have very little of one food type.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,879
Dr. Achari says that when this happens to her, she's not as sharp as intelligent and

45
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,439
quick to notice things as usual.

46
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:56,560
Dr. Achari names lots of different foods which help boost our brains.

47
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,560
From wild caught Alaskan salmon and avocado to berries and walnuts.

48
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,879
But hang on Georgie, wild caught Alaskan salmon.

49
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,560
Very nice and very expensive.

50
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,919
It sounds like these super foods are just for the super rich.

51
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:16,319
Well, not according to Blogger Michel Munt.

52
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,799
After she is telling BBC World Services the food chain, how eating well needn't cost

53
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:22,799
a fortune.

54
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:31,000
It's not expensive and everyone's got a freeze of these days so yes, you can batch cook

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,280
things, freeze them and then use them in like a week's time or something.

56
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,799
So I think the problem is that again it's about our lifestyles.

57
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,560
It's about the fact that we feel like we've got limited time and therefore people are trying

58
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:52,280
to cut the tongue down the kitchen by cooking things that are pre-made or even worse we're

59
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,319
just chucking it in the microwave.

60
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:02,319
But actually you can do fresh food in 20 minutes flat.

61
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,520
Michel's idea for brain food on a budget involves batch cooking.

62
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,599
Batch cooking means cooking a lot of food at one time then saving some to eat later,

63
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,840
usually by freezing it.

64
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,199
Although microwave ready meals are convenient, they lack many nutrients needed by the brain.

65
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:27,519
Luckily, adding some fresh vegetables to batch cooked food means anyone can make a brain

66
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:34,079
healthy meal quickly or in 20 minutes flat, as Michel says, using the word flat to mean

67
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,079
exactly and to emphasise that it can be done quickly.

68
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:43,040
OK, so we need balanced diets and batch cooking for big brains.

69
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,080
Now let's test your brain Georgie with my question.

70
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:54,160
Right, you asked which mammal has the biggest brain and I guessed it was an African elephant.

71
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,760
Which was the wrong answer I'm afraid?

72
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:04,759
In fact the biggest brain belongs to the sperm whale, weighing about 8 kilos and the sperm

73
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,360
whale's main food, fish.

74
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,000
OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme starting with sugar

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
rush.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,399
Suddenly feeling excited and full of energy after eating food which contains a lot of sugar.

77
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:26,199
A balanced diet includes the correct combinations of food needed to stay healthy.

78
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:30,000
If you go low on something, you have very little of it.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,079
If you describe someone as sharp, you mean they're intelligent and quick to react to things.

80
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:41,839
Batch cooking means cooking a lot of food at the same time and saving some for later.

81
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:48,159
And finally, doing something in 20 minutes flat means 20 minutes exactly and is used

82
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,959
to emphasise that it's done very quickly.

83
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,359
Once again our six minutes are up.

84
00:05:54,359 --> 00:06:00,159
Have fun cooking up your own brain boosting breakfasts and remember to join us again next

85
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,159
time.

86
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:02,159
Here at 6 Minute English.

87
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:03,159
Goodbye for now.

88
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:04,159
Bye.
