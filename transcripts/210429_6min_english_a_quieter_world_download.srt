00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,199
Hello, this is 6-Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,640
And I'm Georgina.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,839
In this program, we're talking about something that always surrounds us. Noise.

7
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,560
Yes, whether it's the natural sounds of bird song,

8
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,320
the wind blowing or man-made noise like traffic or music.

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,399
There's always something we can hear.

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,960
Of course, there are sounds that we like to hear,

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,159
and then there are those sounds that really great

12
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,679
annoy or irritate.

13
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:44,719
Like the beeping sound on a reversing lorry or someone drilling a hole in the road.

14
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,000
Indeed, soon we'll be looking at the language of noise and hearing about ideas for making the world

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,439
acquire to place.

16
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:55,039
But let's kick off with a question about the measurement of sound,

17
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,039
which is in units called decibels.

18
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,039
According to a guide by the World Health Organization,

19
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,640
what is considered the highest level we can be safely exposed to for a maximum of eight hours?

20
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,760
Is it A55 decibels?

21
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,840
B85 decibels or C125 decibels?

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,280
I imagine it's quite low, so I'll go for A55 decibels.

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,480
Well, as always, I'll reveal the correct answer later.

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,520
Now, let's sound out what people know about sound.

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,600
Starting with Julian Treasurer, the founder of the Sound Agency,

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,680
he spoke to the BBC World Service Programme People Fixing the World.

27
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,159
He discussed why noise is a form of pollution and it's bad for our health,

28
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,680
but we don't always realize.

29
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,880
Sound has power for the effects on us all the time, even though most of the time we're not conscious of it,

30
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,640
because we've kind of got into the habit of suppressing our listening.

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,599
There's so much noise around us in cities that we get into the habit of ignoring it.

32
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,359
Now, that's not a great thing when the noise is having a bad effect on us.

33
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,000
Julian makes a good point that sounds affect us all the time, even when we don't realize

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,840
we're not conscious of it, so we're not aware of it, but it is there.

35
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,240
It may be irritating us, but we don't stop to think what it is that's annoying us.

36
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,800
As Julian also said, we get into the habit of ignoring sounds.

37
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,080
When you get into the habit of something, you start doing something regularly without even

38
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,040
thinking about it. And another habit we get into is suppressing our listening,

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,560
so preventing or stopping ourselves from hearing the noises.

40
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,120
The experts have found this isn't good for us.

41
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,280
That noise in the background can lead to stress and mental health issues.

42
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,160
Yes, we all need some peace and quiet.

43
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,400
Of course, there are many techniques for reducing and absorbing noise.

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,120
For example, trees are grown by motorways to absorb the traffic noise.

45
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,759
At a large rock concert, acoustic screens are put up to stop the sound being heard too far away.

46
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:00,800
Or sound ideas. I mean, good ideas.

47
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,840
But let's head to the world's noisiest city, Mumbai, and India, where honking car horns are a big problem.

48
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,759
I love the sound of that word honk, a short, loud sound, but I don't like the actual noise.

49
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:19,359
The people fixing the world program discuss this problem and met a woman who's been working

50
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:24,159
for years to try and reduce noise levels and create quiet zones.

51
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,479
She's Samiru Abdel Ali from the Aours Foundation, and she explained why honking horns was a hard

52
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:37,599
thing to control. Honking and noise in general in India is a medium of expression, of sadness,

53
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:43,599
of happiness, of every kind. This is what I was told when I started working, that these are

54
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,199
all western ideas to want to control noise. Indians love noise. And it's about the noise,

55
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:54,639
it's about the colour, it's about the laughter and happiness. We don't want to be like the

56
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:00,400
West, you know, those kind of dull-boring people who don't express themselves the way we do.

57
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,799
I like how honking a horn isn't just for road safety. It's almost another language.

58
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:13,199
People express themselves or show how they feel by sounding their car horn. To control this noise,

59
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:19,759
to be quieter, is considered a western idea. But Samiru is trying to change drivers behaviour,

60
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,360
and after much effort even got the police to run a campaign. If noise levels at traffic lights

61
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,839
went over 85 decibels, the lights would remain on red for longer. Sounds like a good idea.

62
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:38,480
There's much more about this on the BBC's Fixing the World webpage. So Neil, you just mentioned

63
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,960
85 decibels. Is that the answer to the question you asked earlier?

64
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,920
Earlier I asked according to a guide by the World Health Organization, what is considered the

65
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:54,720
highest level we can be safely exposed to for a maximum of 8 hours? I said 55 decibels.

66
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,439
Well, it's actually 85 decibels Georgina, bad luck. The permissible time for safe listening

67
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:08,080
decreases as sound levels increase. So, for example, a sound as high as 100 decibels,

68
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:14,159
the level produced by a subway train can be safely listened to for only 15 minutes each day.

69
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:20,000
Well, that's good to know. Now, let's recap on some of the vocabulary we've been discussing,

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,199
starting with great. Spelt GRATE. It means annoy or irritate.

71
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,560
When we are conscious of something, we are aware of it. And when we get into the habit of something,

72
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,560
we start doing something regularly, often without even thinking about it.

73
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,639
Suppressing describes preventing, stopping or reducing something.

74
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,839
Honk is the short, loud sound a car horn makes. Like this. Honk.

75
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:51,439
I can hear you coming Neil. Finally, to express yourself means to show how you feel.

76
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:56,079
Well, I must express my sadness because we're out of time now. But there are lots more

77
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,560
six-minute English programs to enjoy on our website at BBCLearningEnglish.com.

78
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,519
We also have an app you can download for free from the app stores and where you can download

79
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,439
this program. And of course, we are all over social media.

80
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,439
Thanks for listening and goodbye. Goodbye!
