From BBC Learning English

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,040
Hello and happy Christmas.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,760
This is 6 Minute English with me, Neil,

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,359
and joining me today is Sam.

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,320
Hello.

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,879
So, Sam, are you feeling excited about Christmas?

10
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:23,839
Of course.

11
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,440
Time with friends and family,

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,400
eating lots,

13
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:28,079
passing, presents,

14
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,000
and generally indulging.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,119
What's not to like?

16
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,519
Indulging, allowing yourself to

17
00:00:33,519 --> 00:00:36,320
have perhaps too much of something you enjoy.

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,719
Well, it only happens once a year, Sam,

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,519
but for those of us who do celebrate Christmas,

20
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:42,799
it comes at a price.

21
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:45,519
Yes, well, buying all those presents can be expensive.

22
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:46,719
Not just that, Sam.

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,039
I mean, it comes at a cost to the environment,

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,879
as we'll explain shortly.

25
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,000
But let's start off with a quiz question for you to answer.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,640
In 2010, a Christmas tree in Belgium

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,719
was awarded the world record

28
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,480
for having the most lights on it.

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,399
But do you know how many?

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,319
Were there A19,672?

31
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,920
B94,672?

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,640
Or C194,672?

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,680
What do you think, Sam?

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,159
Well, I don't think you could fit

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,640
194,673 lights on a Christmas tree.

36
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,799
So I'll say A19,672?

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,439
Okay, well, we'll find out how bright you are

38
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,200
at the end of the programme.

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,400
Of course, Christmas trees are the ultimate Christmas decoration.

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,480
It's part of the Christmas tradition

41
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,200
and millions are bought around the world each year.

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,680
But what impact do Christmas trees,

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,640
real and artificial have on the environment?

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,159
Well, before we answer that,

45
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,359
let's hear from some of the BBC learning English team

46
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,319
who chose to have a real Christmas tree in their home

47
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,399
and find out why.

48
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,639
Well, you've got the smell of it, you've got the look of it,

49
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:58,079
but more importantly,

50
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,239
Christmas trees are supposed to be symbolic, aren't they?

51
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,839
So it's the idea of something that stays green all year,

52
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:06,479
so bringing that into your house, it means something.

53
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,039
I just think a real Christmas tree is more festive

54
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,719
and more Christmasy,

55
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,759
and it's just the tradition to get a real Christmas tree, that's all.

56
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,000
There's something more beautiful about the nature,

57
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,960
the smell, the feel, the look of the tree.

58
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,039
And I like it to be sustainable.

59
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,039
So as long as I get my tree from a person that promises to grow

60
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,520
two or three in its place, then I'm really, really happy.

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes, I agree. You can't beat having a real Christmas tree.

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,759
And as Phil said, it's symbolic.

63
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,680
It represents something important

64
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,479
and here a Christmas tree is the symbol of Christmas.

65
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,199
And as Jane mentioned, it's a tradition,

66
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,439
something that's done regularly and has become the expected thing to do.

67
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,919
And I'd agree it makes things more festive.

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,280
A word to describe the joyful feeling you get

69
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,680
when celebrating something like Christmas.

70
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,840
But of course all these trees are often thrown away, which is wasteful.

71
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,120
That's why Roy mentioned his tree being sustainable,

72
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,159
which means they can continue to be grown and cut down over a longer period.

73
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,479
And so it's less harmful to the environment.

74
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,280
Well, an alternative to a real Christmas tree

75
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,599
is a fake or artificial one,

76
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,479
which is what Fae Fae from our team has in her house.

77
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,479
What are the reasons why?

78
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,240
We have a plastic Christmas tree, which we've had for about nine years.

79
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,400
So it's plastic so you can reuse it every year.

80
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:39,120
And it's more economical and we don't have to keep buying new trees.

81
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,479
So Fae Fae's fake tree is made of plastic.

82
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,639
So that's not great for recycling.

83
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,639
But the good thing is she uses it year after year, which makes it economical,

84
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,439
which means it doesn't cost a lot of money. It's good value.

85
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:57,119
Ah, but even Fae Fae admits it doesn't have the smell and feel of a real tree.

86
00:03:57,119 --> 00:03:58,959
So dilemma, isn't it Neil?

87
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,159
Yes, what's best for us and what's best for the environment?

88
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,919
The BBC's reality check programme found that real trees take about 12 years to grow.

89
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,319
And as they do, they absorb carbon from the atmosphere and nitrogen from the soil.

90
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,599
So a good thing.

91
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,639
But when it's chopped down, it starts to release emissions back into the atmosphere,

92
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,360
especially if you have to transport it to your home.

93
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,199
And when Christmas is over, if it ends up in landfill,

94
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,600
the tree's carbon footprint will be higher.

95
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,079
But its carbon footprint will be lowered if it's recycled or composted.

96
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:37,839
That's the process of allowing it to decay and then adding it to the ground to improve soil quality.

97
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:42,639
A fake tree, on the other hand, is usually imported and can't usually be recycled,

98
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,039
but as Fae Fae mentioned, it can be reused.

99
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,039
But without any type of Christmas tree, where would we put all those lights I mentioned earlier, Sam?

100
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:56,719
I asked you, in 2010, a Christmas tree in Belgium was awarded the World Record for having the most

101
00:04:56,719 --> 00:04:59,919
lights on it. But do you know how many? What did you say, Sam?

102
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,839
I think I said 19,672.

103
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,279
Oh dear, not very bright. I'm afraid they were, in fact,

104
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:11,439
194,672.

105
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,039
Wow, think of the electricity that must have used.

106
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,679
Indeed, well, let's enlighten everyone with some of the vocabulary we've discussed today.

107
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:23,119
Okay, well, we started talking about indulging.

108
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:27,759
That means allowing yourself to have perhaps too much of something you enjoy.

109
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,599
When something is symbolic, it represents something important.

110
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:36,719
And the word festive describes the joyful feeling you get when celebrating something like Christmas.

111
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,400
Like the festive jumper you're wearing today, Neil. Very jolly.

112
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:47,040
Okay, next we mentioned sustainable, which means the ability to do something over a long period of

113
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,680
time without harming the environment.

114
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,960
Economic call describes doing something that doesn't cost a lot of money.

115
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,080
It's good value.

116
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,520
And when something is composted, it is allowed to decay.

117
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,800
And it turns into compost, which can be added back into the soil to improve its quality.

118
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,560
Thank you, Sam. And that brings us to the end of six minute English for now.

119
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,600
It just leaves us to wish you a very happy Christmas.

120
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,319
Goodbye.

121
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,040
Bye-bye.
