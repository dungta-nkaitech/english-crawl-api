From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,199
Hello, this is 6 Minute English. I'm Georgina.

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,440
And I'm Rob.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,559
Are you a punctuation pedant?

8
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,719
Do you get upset, annoyed or angry

9
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,400
if you see punctuation being used incorrectly,

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,199
particularly apostrophes?

11
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:27,839
Oh, well, it depends.

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,559
Usually, I'm pretty chilled out about it,

13
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,560
but sometimes, just sometimes, it really winds me up.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,439
For example, if I see a sign for taxes at a train station

15
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,399
and it says taxi apostrophe S,

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,600
ah, why? Why?

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,840
The apostrophe is not used to show there is more than one.

18
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,120
It's used to show there is a missing letter

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,560
or that the word is a possessive.

20
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,840
It's just wrong.

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,560
So that does kind of make my blood boil.

22
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,280
So when you say you're pretty chilled about it, you mean?

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,520
OK, OK, I'm not chilled at all,

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,640
but maybe I wish I was.

25
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,920
Well, we're going to be taking a look at reactions

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,040
to the use and abuse of apostrophes in this programme

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,640
but first a question.

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,960
The word apostrophe itself, which language does it come from?

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,640
Is it A, Latin, B, Greek or C, Arabic?

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,280
What do you think, Rob?

31
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,079
Well, I don't think it's Arabic,

32
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,280
so it's a toss up between Latin and Greek.

33
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,159
I'm going to say Greek.

34
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,399
OK, we'll see if you're correct at the end of the programme.

35
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:34,200
The apostrophe it is true to say is often misused.

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,879
It's put where it shouldn't be and not used where it should be.

37
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,359
Is it important, though?

38
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,719
Does it matter?

39
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,239
After all, in spoken English,

40
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,159
there is no difference between it's

41
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,400
within apostrophe and it's without.

42
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,920
Your and your short for you are sound the same.

43
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,319
So what's the problem in written English?

44
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:56,159
In many cases, there isn't a problem at all.

45
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,039
There will be very little confusion,

46
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:02,799
but I don't think that means we should just ignore the correct way to use them.

47
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,879
Sometimes it can be very important to make clear

48
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:09,560
if it's a singular or plural or possessive.

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,800
Another important thing to remember is that in CVs and job applications,

50
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,479
a good standard of spelling and punctuation is expected.

51
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:21,039
Get it wrong and you could miss out on a good opportunity.

52
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,879
There is one group that has tried for nearly 20 years

53
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,120
to keep others to these high standards,

54
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,840
the apostrophe protection society.

55
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,560
They have publicly pointed out incorrect use in public signs and communications,

56
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,079
attacked it that has not always been welcome or successful,

57
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:40,359
but like the apostrophe itself, the group is in danger.

58
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:43,719
Here's a BBC news report on the subject.

59
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:46,280
They linger above our letters,

60
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,039
they wander around the endings of our words,

61
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,199
but apostrophes, it seems, are an endangered species.

62
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:58,439
The apostrophe protection society, yes, there really is one,

63
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:01,719
says their future is well up in the air.

64
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:04,359
How does he describe apostrophes?

65
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:07,239
Using metaphorical poetic language,

66
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:09,639
he says they linger above our letters.

67
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:13,399
To linger is a verb usually used to describe someone or something,

68
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:16,759
staying somewhere before finally leaving.

69
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,719
So we have apostrophes lingering above our letters,

70
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:23,479
and also he said they wander around the end of the words.

71
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:26,120
Yes, also a metaphorical use.

72
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,319
To wander means to walk slowly around without any real purpose or urgency.

73
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,560
And he went on to say that the future of the apostrophe is up in the air.

74
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,399
When something is up in the air, it means its future is not certain,

75
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:41,000
it's not guaranteed.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,519
So if, for example, your holiday plans are up in the air,

77
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,840
it means there is some kind of problem and you might not be going on holiday after all.

78
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,400
The person who founded the apostrophe protection society is John Edwards.

79
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,000
Now 96 years old, he has decided to give it up,

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,240
partly because of his age, but also because he thinks that due to the impact of

81
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,280
texting and social media, he has lost the battle against bad punctuation.

82
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,719
So why has it come to this?

83
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:13,000
Here he is explaining why he thinks people aren't bothered about using correct punctuation.

84
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,079
I think it's a mixture of ignorance and laziness.

85
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,240
They're too ignorant to know where it goes, they're too lazy to learn.

86
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,160
So they just don't bother the barbarians of one.

87
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,839
So what's his reason?

88
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:30,279
He blames ignorance and laziness.

89
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:33,959
Ignorance is a lack of knowledge or understanding of something,

90
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:37,079
so people don't know the rules and are too lazy to learn them,

91
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,439
according to Edwards.

92
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,959
Quite strong views there.

93
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,879
Yes, and you thought I was a pedant.

94
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,040
He actually goes further to say that the barbarians have won.

95
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:52,439
Barbarian is a historical word for people who weren't part of so-called civilised society.

96
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:56,040
They were seen as violent and aggressive, primitive and uncivilised.

97
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,360
So it's not a compliment then?

98
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:58,839
Oh no.

99
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,879
Right, before we review today's vocabulary, let's have the answer to today's quiz.

100
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:07,560
Which language does the word apostrophe come from?

101
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,680
What did you say?

102
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,360
I went for Greek.

103
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:14,040
Congratulations to you and anyone else who got that right.

104
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,800
Greek is the right answer.

105
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,680
Now let's remind ourselves of today's vocabulary.

106
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,840
First, what's a pedant, Rob?

107
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,560
A pedant is someone who corrects other people's small mistakes,

108
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,520
particularly in grammar and punctuation.

109
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,759
But it's not the same as an English teacher.

110
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:35,240
A pedant will correct native speakers mistakes too and not in the classroom.

111
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,439
Tulingo means to stay somewhere for longer.

112
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:43,160
To wander is to walk around without a real purpose or intention to get somewhere quickly.

113
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,319
If your plans are up in the air, it means they are at risk and might not happen.

114
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,240
Ignorance is the state of not knowing something that should be known.

115
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,120
And finally, a barbarian is a word for a primitive and uncivilised person.

116
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,920
Right, we can't linger in the studio as our six minutes are up.

117
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,720
You can find more from us about punctuation and many other aspects of English online

118
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,240
on social media and on the BBC Learning English app.

119
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,680
Bye for now. Bye-bye.
