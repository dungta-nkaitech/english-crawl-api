00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:15,120
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil, Beth.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,480
What are you doing? Get off your phone!

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,960
Oh, sorry. And I'm Beth.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,920
Are you addicted to social media? It wouldn't be a surprise. With so many different apps

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,840
out there, Snapchat, TikTok and the latest threads, it's easy to spend a lot more time

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,760
on your phone than ever before.

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,600
Yes, I don't think I'm addicted, but I definitely spend more time on social media than I'd

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,200
like to. However, there are plenty of studies out there looking at how social media affects

10
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,079
mental health, with some saying it can be as addictive as gambling.

11
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,680
Research in the US has found that adolescents who spend more than three hours a day on social

12
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:03,799
media have double the risk of developing depression and anxiety. An adolescent is someone aged

13
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:11,159
10 to 19, between childhood and adulthood. With that in mind, it's no wonder parents are worried.

14
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:17,640
To help with this, the US is currently in the process of regulating social media apps for teenagers.

15
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,439
Some scientists think the UK should do the same.

16
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:25,560
There has been growing agreement among health experts about the negative,

17
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,480
chronic health effects of social media use on teenagers. They have revealed in surveys that

18
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:37,799
social media makes them feel worse about their body image, and 64% of teens have said they're

19
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,960
regularly exposed to hate-based content. In this programme, we'll be discussing how social media

20
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,000
affects teenagers, and as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

21
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,480
But first, I have a question for you, Beth. The app, Snapchat, is a very common way that

22
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:02,520
teenagers communicate these days. This is partly because messages and photos disappear after a certain

23
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:13,480
time period. But what percentage of 13 to 24-year-olds use Snapchat? Is it a 70%, b 80% or c 90%.

24
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,560
I'll guess 80%.

25
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:22,599
Okay, Beth, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme. Now, a lot of social media platforms,

26
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:28,599
such as TikTok, work by showing and suggesting similar accounts and content to those someone has

27
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:35,479
already searched for. Professor Devi Shrouda, the chair of Global Public Health at the University of

28
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:41,400
Edinburgh, thinks this can be concerning, as she told BBC World Service programme Inside Science.

29
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,639
And this is worrying, for example, with young girls and eating disorders, if they're being fed

30
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,039
that in an addictive way, and the algorithm is saying, oh, they like that content. We want to keep

31
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,199
giving it to them because it keeps them on their phones. And I think that's the really vital message

32
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:04,199
here of any of these apps, is that their revenue comes from advertising. Teenagers are being fed

33
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:10,120
content in a way that is addictive. If you are fed something, it means you're given something.

34
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:16,519
In this case, it refers to content, not food. The content is addictive because social media uses

35
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:23,400
algorithms. Algorithms are a complex set of rules and calculations that prioritize and personalise

36
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,439
the content a user sees. But we need to remember that social media platforms use algorithms to keep

37
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:36,439
users on the platforms for as long as possible because the revenue comes from advertising.

38
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:43,719
Revenue is the money a company earns. They're paid by other companies to use the social media space

39
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:50,439
to promote their products. This could be seen as social media platforms prioritising making money

40
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:56,280
over the mental health of users, a worry for parents. Professor Devi Shridhar talked about the

41
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,759
challenges of having a teenager addicted to social media on BBC World Service programme in Inside Science.

42
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,879
And so I think the challenge here is apparent listening to this is what do you do about it?

43
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,439
And I think the owners has really been put on parents and concerned adults to find solutions

44
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:16,839
on their own and that means debates with your child over what are you on, are you using this?

45
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,040
But it's a losing battle because it's their entire social network.

46
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:26,680
Professor Shridhar says that when it comes to helping teenagers navigate social media,

47
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,720
the owners has been put on parents to find solutions. The owners means the responsibility or duty.

48
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:39,959
Parents need to be able to challenge their children when they need to, even if this is a losing

49
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:45,799
battle, a fight they cannot win, as teenagers have their entire life on social networks.

50
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:51,639
Okay Beth, I think it's time I revealed the answer to my question. I asked you what percentage of

51
00:04:51,639 --> 00:05:00,519
13 to 24-year-olds use Snapchat? And I said it was 80%. And that was, I'm sorry to say the wrong

52
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:07,959
answer. Actually 90% of people age between 13 and 24 use Snapchat quite a lot.

53
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:13,639
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this program, starting with Adolescent,

54
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:18,199
a person aged 10 to 19, between childhood and adulthood.

55
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:24,279
If you are fed content, you are given content. This is what the social media platform

56
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:28,759
offers you automatically, rather than what you search for yourself.

57
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:35,879
Algorithms are a complex set of rules and calculations that prioritize and personalize the content

58
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:43,159
a user sees. Revenue is the money a company earns, which could come from sales or advertising.

59
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:47,800
If the onus is on someone, it's their responsibility or duty.

60
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:54,920
And finally, a losing battle is a fight you cannot win. Once again, our six minutes are up.

61
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:01,000
Join us again soon for more useful vocabulary here at 6 Minute English. Goodbye for now. Bye.
