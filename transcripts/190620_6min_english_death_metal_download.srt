00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,120
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,320
And I'm Rob.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,320
Rob, do you like metal?

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,519
Oh, that's an odd question. I've never really thought about it.

9
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,679
I mean, I use metal things every day. My toaster, my bike, the underground.

10
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,480
No, no, no. Not that kind of metal.

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,679
This kind of metal.

12
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:40,079
Oh, that's kind of metal. The musical genre, the type of music.

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,120
Yes. And a particular death metal.

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,519
That fast, loud, aggressive sounding guitar-based music style.

15
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:48,960
Yep, that's the one.

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,120
Nope, not my cup of tea at all. What kind of person do you think I am?

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,640
Well, that's the point. The type of person who likes death metal

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,520
may not be the kind of person you think they are.

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,399
More on that shortly, but first, a quiz.

20
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,480
The electric guitar is an essential element to death metal music

21
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,159
in which decade were the first electric guitars produced.

22
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,400
Was it A, the 1920s, B, the 1930s, or C, the 1940s?

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,480
Ooh, I think quite early, so I'm going to say the 1920s.

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,040
Well, we'll see if you're right later in the program.

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,880
Does violent music give people violent thoughts?

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,440
Recent research claims to have found the answer.

27
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,640
This is how the topic was introduced on BBC News.

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,480
What was the conclusion?

29
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,560
A psychological study of fans of death metal suggests that they are not

30
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,320
desensitized of violence despite the genre's association with growling,

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,640
often graphically violent lyrics, including depictions of cannibalism.

32
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,560
Researchers found that the main response of fans to the music they love was joy.

33
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,680
Not violence, adding that most are very nice people who wouldn't dream of hurting anyone,

34
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,120
let alone eating them.

35
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,520
So, what conclusion did the researchers come to?

36
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,199
Well, they found that the response to the music was joy, not anger or violence.

37
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,560
It made people happy.

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,759
There was a fear that listening to music with violent lyrics,

39
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:18,480
which means violent words, would make people desensitized to violence.

40
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,240
If you're desensitized to something, you don't see it as unusual or

41
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,080
unacceptable. It doesn't bother you.

42
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,600
The newsreader also said that the lyrics of death metal include topics such as cannibalism,

43
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,000
which is the practice of eating human flesh.

44
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,760
Listening to someone singing about eating people apparently didn't make them feel like

45
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,960
snacking on their neighbours.

46
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,960
Let's hear the introduction again.

47
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,879
A psychological study of fans of death metal suggests that they are not

48
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,040
desensitized of violence despite the genre's association with growling,

49
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,280
often graphically violent lyrics, including depictions of cannibalism.

50
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,039
Researchers found that the main response of fans to the music they love was joy,

51
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,919
not violence, adding that most are very nice people who wouldn't dream of hurting anyone,

52
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,280
let alone eating them.

53
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,919
Professor Bill Thompson from Macquarie University in Sydney conducted this research.

54
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,919
What does he say people don't feel when listening to this kind of music?

55
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:23,359
Most fans are not angry, most are actually musically trained people who really get a lot of

56
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:28,239
empowerment and aesthetic interest out of the music. They feel joyful, they feel transcendent,

57
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,439
they feel empowered, but what they don't feel is angry.

58
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:40,239
What don't people feel? They don't feel angry. What they do feel is joyful, the adjective from joy.

59
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,519
They feel happy. Something else they feel is empowered. This is a feeling of being in

60
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,280
control of your life that you can make and follow your own decisions.

61
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,120
Music is certainly a powerful art form. Professor Thompson also said that fans have an aesthetic

62
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,120
interest in it. This means that they appreciate it as an art form. Let's hear Professor Thompson again.

63
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,719
Most fans are not angry, most are actually musically trained people who really get a lot of

64
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:13,600
empowerment and aesthetic interest out of the music. They feel joyful, they feel transcendent,

65
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,719
they feel empowered, but what they don't feel is angry.

66
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,279
Time to review our vocabulary. But first, let's have the answer to the quiz question,

67
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:31,199
in which decade were the first electric guitars produced? Was it A, the 1920s, B, the 1930s,

68
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:38,319
or C, the 1940s? What did you think Rob? I took a guess at the 1920s. Well, electric guitars were

69
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,599
early, but not quite that early. I'm afraid the first ones were produced in the 1930s.

70
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:48,959
So, well done, if, unlike Rob, you got that correct. Now onto the vocabulary.

71
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,959
Yes, we had a few words connected with music. We had genre for a style of music and also lyrics

72
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,159
for the words of a song. Some of the lyrics of death metal songs are about eating people,

73
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:06,079
which is called cannibalism. Cannibalism is a form of extreme violence, and there was some concern

74
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:12,639
that people exposed to such violent lyrics in songs might become desensitised to actual violence.

75
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,560
This means that they would accept violence as normal and not be worried by it.

76
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,879
However, the research show that this doesn't happen and fans actually feel joy,

77
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,240
which is another way of saying happiness. The research also suggested that fans have an

78
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,360
artistic appreciation of death metal described as an aesthetic interest.

79
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,360
The final word was for a feeling that fans might get after listening to the music, empowered.

80
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,199
Someone who is empowered is in control of their own life and decisions.

81
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,080
And I feel empowered to bring this edition of 6 Minute English to a close.
