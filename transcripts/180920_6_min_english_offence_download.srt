From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,960
Hello, welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,679
And I'm Rob. Rob.

7
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:20,160
Would you say that you were a snowflake?

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,400
Wow. I can't believe you said that.

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,120
That's so offensive.

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,000
How could you be so rude?

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,320
So, I guess that's it. Yes, then.

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,080
Sorry, I only asked.

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,119
Don't worry, I wasn't really upset.

14
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,200
I just wanted to demonstrate the meaning of the word.

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,799
The word snowflake has taken on a new meaning in recent years.

16
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:41,320
These days, it's used as an insult.

17
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,000
It's used to criticise people or groups

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,560
that are seen to be very easily offended

19
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,640
or upset by things that others say.

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,000
There is usually a political side to it, too, isn't there?

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,719
Yes, people who use the word snowflake

22
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,039
tend to be from the political right

23
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:00,519
and they usually use it about those on the political left,

24
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:04,239
particularly millennials, young, socially aware adults.

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,879
Well, we'll explore this topic in more detail shortly,

26
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:09,120
but first, a quiz question,

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,079
in which year was snowflake

28
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:14,120
one of Colin's dictionaries words of the year?

29
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:21,079
Was it a 1996, B, 2006, or C, 2016?

30
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:22,840
Well, we said it's quite a recent word,

31
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,439
so I'm going for C, 2016.

32
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,599
Well, we'll find out if you're right later on in the programme.

33
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:31,719
The topic of offence is a very complicated one.

34
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:34,640
First, what do we mean by offence, Rob?

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,799
Thanks for that.

36
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:38,200
That is a really difficult question.

37
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,400
Something that is offensive is rude,

38
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,840
insulting and makes people feel hurt and upset.

39
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,719
What's difficult about it, though,

40
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,120
is that we don't all find the same things offensive.

41
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,959
Some people can be deliberately offensive

42
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:53,920
and some people may be offensive without meaning to be.

43
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,280
Also, different people respond to offence in different ways.

44
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,000
Some accept it as the price of free speech

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,040
and some try to stop the people they think are offensive

46
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,840
from saying the things they do.

47
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,439
These terms come up quite a lot in discussions

48
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,879
about equality, race, religion and, of course, politics.

49
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,240
The topic was discussed in detail in the BBC Radio programme,

50
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,520
Sweet Reason.

51
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,240
Evan Davis presented the programme,

52
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,639
and here is the first part of his summary of the discussion.

53
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,360
What does he say is the reason

54
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,040
that some people talk about offence?

55
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,880
First, on occasion, people probably do invoke offence,

56
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,200
when really they just have a political disagreement,

57
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,520
and on occasion, groups that suffer discrimination

58
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,360
or exclusion, perhaps find it exhilarating

59
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,920
or uniting to call out that discrimination.

60
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,320
He says that some people take offence

61
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,400
when it's just a political disagreement.

62
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,200
He says they invoke offence.

63
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,400
If you invoke something, it means that you use it

64
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,280
to support your point or explain your action.

65
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,319
So to invoke offence is to say that we are acting this way

66
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:00,040
because we are offended by what you've said.

67
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,800
Although the offence may only be a political difference

68
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,159
rather than something truly offensive.

69
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:08,000
Davis goes on to say that groups that do suffer

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,400
from discrimination may get some feelings of unity

71
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,800
when they call out discrimination.

72
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,080
They feel more together when they publicise

73
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,240
and highlight the discrimination they've experienced.

74
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,280
Even though some offence that is taken may not be genuine,

75
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,280
that doesn't mean people don't have a right to be offended.

76
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,080
He's Evan Davis again.

77
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,719
Where the so-called snowflakes surely have a point is this.

78
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,760
Societies are entitled to make certain things taboo,

79
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,800
and the millennial's use of the word offensive

80
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,439
is simply designed to say some views are not just wrong,

81
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,240
they're in a special category wrong.

82
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,520
His point here is that societies can decide

83
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,719
that certain things are taboo.

84
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,919
In this context, something that is taboo

85
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,159
is something that is regarded by society

86
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,520
as being shocking and offensive,

87
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,719
and that it's okay for people to be offended by these things.

88
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:00,000
And I think the point he makes is a good one.

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,360
The word snowflake is usually used as an insult,

90
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,079
but some people may feel proud to be a snowflake

91
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,719
because it means they're standing up for a particular standard.

92
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:12,960
They have a level of decency and social responsibility

93
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,120
that is higher than that of those who are calling them snowflakes.

94
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,399
Well, I hope we haven't caused any offense today.

95
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,959
Before we review the vocabulary,

96
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,720
can we have the answer to today's question, Neil?

97
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
Of course.

98
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,199
I asked in which year was snowflake

99
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,720
one of Colin's dictionaries words of the year?

100
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Was it A, 1996, B, 2006 or C, 2016?

101
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,879
And I said C, 2016 is gotta be right.

102
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,439
Well, do you wanna hear the story?

103
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,519
Interestingly, the term was coined in 1996 in the book Fight Club,

104
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,199
but it was in 2016 that it was one of the dictionaries words of the year.

105
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,839
Now, let's review our words of the day.

106
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:54,439
First, there is offense.

107
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:59,359
People can take offense and be offended by something that is offensive,

108
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:03,479
something that is offensive could be rude, insulting and shocking.

109
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:08,479
It might take the form of humiliation or discrimination against a person or group.

110
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,199
The term snowflake is a word used by some people

111
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,000
to talk about other people who they think get offended too easily

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,639
and unnecessarily.

113
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,800
They don't want to change their language or ideas just because snowflakes get upset.

114
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,759
Then we had the word invoke.

115
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,199
If you invoke something, you use it as a reason to explain your actions and feelings.

116
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,480
To call something out is to challenge it, to highlight it and look for justification.

117
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,279
And finally, we have taboo.

118
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:39,560
Something that society says is offensive and shocking.

119
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,519
So there we have it.

120
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,720
What do you think Rob of this topic?

121
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,080
Well, it's a very difficult subject,

122
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,880
particularly when it comes to politics, religion and society.

123
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,600
Free speech is good, but at times, particularly on social media,

124
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,600
I think can be unnecessarily unpleasant.

125
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,160
Well, try not to be offended, but it is time for us to leave you for this program.

126
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,560
Do join us next time.

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,159
Absolutely.

133
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,439
Bye-bye.
