From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:12,960
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English,

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,880
the show that brings you an interesting topic,

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,359
authentic listening practice and vocabulary

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,199
to help you improve your language skills.

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm Dan.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,199
And I'm Catherine.

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,240
In this program, we'll be discussing life expectancy

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,879
as well as teaching you six new items of vocabulary, of course.

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,160
Err...

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,359
Dan?

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,560
Dan!

16
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,200
We're doing a show, Dan. Wake up.

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200
Sorry, Catherine. Sorry, everybody.

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,519
I was at a party last night and I didn't get much sleep.

19
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:40,879
Another party, Dan.

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:41,519
Yeah.

21
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:42,799
That's the third this week.

22
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,239
Do you look dead on your feet?

23
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,280
Which is an expression, meaning extremely tired.

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,000
Ah, well.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,679
Live fast, die young.

26
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:50,719
That's my motto.

27
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,280
A motto is a short phrase which reflects

28
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,239
the beliefs of an organisation or person.

29
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,960
And it's interesting that you mentioned dying young Dan

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,320
because our topic this show is life expectancy.

31
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,920
Life expectancy is how many years a person is likely to live.

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,079
I suppose you have a question about it too.

33
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,120
Funny you should say that, Dan.

34
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,840
Yeah.

35
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,920
By the year 2030,

36
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,879
will the USA's life expectancy be A in the top third,

37
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:18,400
B, the middle third,

38
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,040
or C, the bottom third compared to the rest of the world?

39
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,920
Well, the USA is quite a rich country,

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,879
so I'm going to say A, the top one third.

41
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,240
And we'll find out later in the show if you're right or not.

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,159
Now, Dan, life expectancy.

43
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,079
So which country do you think has the current highest life expectancy?

44
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,680
Everybody knows that's Japan.

45
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,480
Ah, yes, but new analysis by the World Health Organization

46
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,960
and Imperial College London predicts that it won't always be so.

47
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,480
Now, they analysed 35 industrialised countries

48
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,120
and found that by the year 2030,

49
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,439
South Korea will be the leaders

50
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,800
with an average life expectancy of a whopping 90 years.

51
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,520
Wow.

52
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,640
How did they do that?

53
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,560
Well, let's find out by listening to Professor Majid Azati,

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,360
Chair in Global Environmental Health at Imperial College London.

55
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,080
It seems to be actually dealing with diet,

56
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,840
but other places,

57
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,879
being very good at taking up new medical knowledge,

58
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,639
technology and using it,

59
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,919
and perhaps most importantly doing this in a relatively equitable way

60
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,359
compared to Western countries.

61
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,120
So basically, good diet,

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,919
using new medical technology and knowledge

63
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,159
and being more equitable or fair and impartial in society.

64
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,680
So how did the UK do?

65
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,599
Well, not too well, actually.

66
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,280
We were thoroughly beaten by our closest neighbour, France.

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,800
What? How comes?

68
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,560
I'll let Professor Majid Azati explain that too.

69
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,360
So France has had some of the lowest obesity rates

70
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,520
in the Western countries,

71
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,960
French women especially.

72
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,719
UK has had some of the highest ones.

73
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,840
And alcohol in France,

74
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,759
at least until now, has been consumed

75
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,400
in much more healthy patterns.

76
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,520
And in the UK, there has been a lot more binge drinking.

77
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,319
So France has low obesity,

78
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,480
which is a state of being very overweight

79
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,680
compared to the UK's high obesity.

80
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,560
And France drinks alcohol much more moderately

81
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,719
than the UK, which tends to binge.

82
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,240
Binging is when you consume a large amount of something

83
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,760
in a short time, especially food or alcohol.

84
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,439
So confession time, Dan.

85
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,439
How many drinks did you have last night?

86
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,360
It was only orange juice, I swear.

87
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,200
So come on, did I get the question right?

88
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,280
You asked me by the year 2030,

89
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,280
will the USA's life expectancy be A in the top one third,

90
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,480
B the middle one third,

91
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,600
or C the bottom one third compared to the rest of the world?

92
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,079
And I said the USA is quite a rich country,

93
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,960
so it's probably A in the top one third.

94
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,560
Sorry, Dan. Nice logic,

95
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,439
but actually the USA is one of the least equitable places in the world.

96
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,919
So their life expectancy suffers,

97
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,359
and the answer was actually C the bottom third.

98
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:08,639
Oh, well, next week maybe.

99
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:11,759
Now, let's take a look at the vocabulary from this program.

100
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,000
First, we had dead on your feet.

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,919
This is an informal expression,

102
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,920
which means extremely tired.

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,400
Another way to say the same thing would be shattered.

104
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,800
When was the last time you were dead on your feet, Catherine?

105
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,199
I built some garden furniture quite recently,

106
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,960
and it took me all day, and I was dead on my feet when I finished.

107
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,960
Now, we had motto.

108
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,120
Now a motto is a short phrase,

109
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,639
which reflects the belief of an organisation or person.

110
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,720
So, Dan, what's your personal motto?

111
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,520
Take the path of least resistance.

112
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,319
What about you?

113
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,200
Less is more.

114
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,240
Yeah, good one.

115
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,240
Then we had life expectancy.

116
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,079
Life expectancy is how many years a person is likely to live.

117
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,879
What do you think is a good life expectancy for a person?

118
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,199
I'm hoping to get to about 85,

119
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,960
and then I'd like a sort of quick access,

120
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,000
because I think it's probably not much fun after that.

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,519
Then we had equitable.

122
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,400
Equitable means being fair or impartial,

123
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
and it comes from the word equal.

124
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
So, Dan, personal question,

125
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,680
would you say that your marriage is equitable?

126
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,600
I'd like to think so, yes.

127
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,480
I do the cooking.

128
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,600
My wife does the cleaning,

129
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,800
and we share the other jobs.

130
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,000
We'll have to get Mrs. Dan in to give her opinion.

131
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,960
After that, we heard obesity.

132
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,080
Obesity describes a state of being very overweight.

133
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,120
It's a medical term,

134
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,920
and is often used in connection with health problems.

135
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,960
The report said that the UK has an obesity problem, Catherine.

136
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,080
How do you think we can solve it?

137
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,319
I think we need a sugar tax,

138
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,920
and everybody should walk to work.

139
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,520
Finally, we had binge.

140
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,400
To binge is to consume a large amount of something

141
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,160
in a short space of time.

142
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,560
Especially something that you don't usually have.

143
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,000
And these days, we hear a lot about binge drinking, binge eating,

144
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,439
and binge watching.

145
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:55,200
So, Dan, when did you last binge watch a series on TV?

146
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,240
It's Game of Thrones.

147
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,040
Game of Thrones?

148
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,120
Game of Series 1, Series 2, Series 3.

149
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,840
Back to back.

150
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,680
Back to back, bingeing, brilliant.

151
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,600
