00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,440
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,879
And I'm Sam.

6
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,120
How's your week been, Sam?

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,120
Oh, you know, quiet.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,879
I haven't done much or been anywhere, so it's been a bit boring.

9
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,240
I know that feeling.

10
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,359
When nothing exciting happens, it can lead to boredom.

11
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,640
The state of feeling little excitement or enthusiasm,

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,039
often because you've got nothing to do.

13
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,879
But, Sam, there is some good news.

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,640
Boredom can be good for you.

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,000
Tell me more.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,879
I will, but not until I've sent you a question to answer.

17
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:51,039
A survey by British newspaper The Mirror found Peter Willis to be the most boring man in Britain.

18
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,280
What boring hobby did he have that earned him that title?

19
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,759
Was it A, collecting train numbers?

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,600
It's train spotting.

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,000
B, taking photos of letterboxes.

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,120
Or C, driving around roundabouts in the UK.

23
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,000
Wow. That all sounds deadly boring,

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,879
but I imagine taking photos of letterboxes is the most boring.

25
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:15,680
Perhaps.

26
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,359
Well, as usual, I will give you the answer at the end of the programme.

27
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,280
But, as you say, we might die of boredom following those hobbies,

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,040
a phrase that expresses how extremely bored you are.

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,720
But not for everyone.

30
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,040
Boredom depends on your state of mind.

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,120
Some of us might find something boring,

32
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,520
while others might find it fascinating.

33
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,240
True.

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,840
But let's talk about feeling bored when we have nothing to do.

35
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,600
Not even train spotting.

36
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,520
Having nothing to do, or doing the same task again and again,

37
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,920
can certainly be demotivating.

38
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,160
But, according to Sandy Mann, who was speaking on the BBC World Services,

39
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,920
the Y Factor programme,

40
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,560
being bored doesn't have to be boring.

41
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,840
It can be good for us.

42
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,159
This emotion that everyone thinks is so negative,

43
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,680
but there's a real positive to it too.

44
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,280
There's a real upside to it.

45
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,040
We become more creative.

46
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,960
So, for example, being bored allows our minds to wonder,

47
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,479
allows us to daydream,

48
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,560
and that can actually lead us to problem solving and creativity.

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,240
Our fear that by swiping and scrolling our boredom away

50
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,520
these days, that we're losing that creativity,

51
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,759
because we've got so much to entertain us.

52
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,159
But it seems that the more we have to entertain us,

53
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,679
the more bored we seem to be.

54
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:30,879
And there's a reason for that.

55
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,000
And that is because we actually get addicted to stimulation and to novelty.

56
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:40,959
Some interesting thoughts from Sandy Mann there.

57
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,519
She says that there's an upside to boredom.

58
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,719
That means a positive side to a bad situation.

59
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,079
And that is, it can make us more creative.

60
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,399
That's because when we have nothing to do,

61
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:54,959
we allow our minds to wonder.

62
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,640
We can think freely, which might help us solve problems.

63
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,040
This can't happen when, as Sandy says,

64
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,319
we swipe and scroll our boredom away.

65
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,680
Referring to the movements, we make on smartphones.

66
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes, and it's smartphones we turn to for entertainment when we are bored.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,840
It gives us stimulation.

68
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,560
It activates or enriches the mind.

69
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,159
And it gives us something new, unusual and different to look at.

70
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,840
What we call novelty.

71
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,520
I'm sure many of us look at our phones when we are in a queue

72
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,879
or sitting on the bus, just to prevent being bored.

73
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,439
But it seems we should just sit and think.

74
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,039
Let's take inspiration from Manush Zomarodi,

75
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,640
an author and host of the Zigzag podcast.

76
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,680
Here she is speaking on the Y Factor program,

77
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,960
explaining that it takes effort, but it's worth it.

78
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,400
We think who wants to be bored?

79
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,280
What an awful sensation that is.

80
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,479
And I think that the issue is with mind wandering,

81
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,199
you don't immediately get to roses and chirping birds

82
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,280
and amazing creative thinking.

83
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,920
There is this uncomfortable period

84
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,520
that you have to pass through,

85
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,199
where maybe you start thinking about things

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
you don't want to think about,

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,639
or uncomfortable situations,

88
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,920
or unpleasant feelings that you have.

89
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,680
That's why boredom, I think,

90
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,279
has such negative connotations

91
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,439
because we feel uncomfortable.

92
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,000
But when we stick with it,

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,679
that's when the good stuff can come.

94
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,039
So we might think of boredom as an awful sensation or feeling,

95
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:34,479
because that's when we start focusing on negative things.

96
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,399
Manush thinks that's why we have negative connotations with boredom.

97
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,879
A connotation is an emotion connected to a word.

98
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,479
But if we work through the bad stuff and stick with it,

99
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,799
amazing creative thinking can happen.

100
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,000
As Manush says, the good stuff can come.

101
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:56,319
So basically, don't think of boredom as being boring.

102
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,839
However, could this adjective be applied to the hobby

103
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,279
that Peter Willis, the most boring man in Britain, does?

104
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:07,119
Yes, Neil, you asked me what that hobby is.

105
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:10,799
And I said he took photos of post-pixes.

106
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:11,599
Was I right?

107
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,719
Yes, you were. Congratulations.

108
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:18,639
The former postman dreams of taking a photo of all of Britain's

109
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,599
115,000 post-boxes.

110
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:23,839
Well, good luck to Visa.

111
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,279
I didn't realise there were so many post-boxes in the UK.

112
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:31,919
So we've been talking about the benefits of boredom today.

113
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,479
Boredom is the state of feeling little excitement or enthusiasm.

114
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,519
We mentioned the phrase,

115
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,039
the die of boredom,

116
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,560
which we use to express how extremely bored we are.

117
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,639
But boredom has an upside,

118
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,319
which means it has a positive side to a bad situation.

119
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,000
We heard the word stimulation,

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,199
which means it activates or enriches the mind.

121
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,240
A novelty which describes something that is new,

122
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,599
unusual or different.

123
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,719
And we described a connotation.

124
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:03,759
That's an emotion connected to a word.

125
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,560
Well, I hope you haven't been bored listening to us.

126
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,759
Goodbye for now.

127
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,560
Bye.
