6 Minute English from the BBC

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,279
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:12,480
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,839
In this program, we'll be discussing the dinner table.

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,160
But we're not interested in food. We're talking about talking.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,800
A lot can happen around the dinner table.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,960
Gossip, arguments. You might meet the love of your life on a blind dinner date.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,320
Or find out you're a great storyteller.

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,759
Neil, when you were younger, did you eat with your family around a dinner table?

10
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:40,399
We did. Eating at the table was an important ritual.

11
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,760
It was something we did every day.

12
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,040
And quite often, it was the only time we could get together and chat.

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,400
I think there's something very comforting about eating good food

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,040
and being with the people you're closest to.

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,920
And now, I do the same with my own family.

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,120
The kids are more likely to open up.

17
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,719
Talk more easily about their day or something troubling them while they're eating.

18
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,159
Well, the dinner table is a space that families across the world get together at.

19
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,400
To not only eat, but chat.

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,280
And it's often the only point in the day or week that the whole family gathers together.

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,679
In this program, we'll be discussing how people behave at the table.

22
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:24,359
And of course, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,159
But first, I have a question for you, Beth.

24
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:34,640
In 2016, a couple from Germany won the world record for the fastest time to set a dinner table.

25
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,959
But how long did it take them?

26
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:44,439
Was it A, 25 seconds, B, 1 minute and 5 seconds, or C, 2 minutes and 5 seconds?

27
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:47,640
Surely not 25 seconds.

28
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,799
I will guess 1 minute, 5 seconds.

29
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,319
OK, Beth, I'll reveal the answer later in the program.

30
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:58,439
Now, while eating with a group, you might feel that you need to act in a certain way

31
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,719
because of the people around you.

32
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:07,159
Philip Aperi, a psychotherapist and author, thinks we should try to be ourselves as much as possible

33
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,719
as she told BBC World Service Program, The Food Chain.

34
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:16,039
In any group, we find a role.

35
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:20,639
And if we're only in one group, if we're only ever with our family, we might think,

36
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,919
oh, I'm the funny one. He's the wise one.

37
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,759
We might think that's who we are.

38
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,959
And then we go to another group and then we find, oh, I'm the wise one.

39
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,119
And I think if you feel like you're assigned a role in your family,

40
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:39,359
I just think take that with a little bit of a pinch of salt.

41
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,399
When you spend time with the same group of people,

42
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:47,759
you might start to think of yourself as the funny one or the wise one.

43
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:56,560
When we say the one, we describe a person by using a particular and prominent characteristic they have.

44
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,679
If you're very tall, you might be the tall one.

45
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:04,799
However, Philip Aperi says we should take these labels with a pinch of salt.

46
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:10,639
An idiom meaning you shouldn't believe or do everything you're told or that's expected of you.

47
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,439
Now, over time, interactions at the dinner table have changed.

48
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:20,319
In the past, children were sometimes seated on a different table to adults,

49
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,759
or toles they should be seen and not heard.

50
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:30,479
An old-fashioned phrase emphasising that children should be quiet and always on their best behaviour.

51
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,840
Embraer Medos Fernandez, a writer and founder of Free Black Motherhood,

52
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,639
spoke about older generations' reactions to children asking awkward questions at the dinner table

53
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,839
to BBC World Service Program, the food chain.

54
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,359
So it's a mixed bag.

55
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:56,879
It's overwhelmingly positive, but I also know that it is kind of a bit of a culture shock

56
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,599
for them to hear my children ask the questions that they ask,

57
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,959
because our children haven't really been raised with that line of demarcation

58
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,439
between the adult table and the key at table.

59
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,639
Embraer says that the older generations' reactions to her children's questions at the table

60
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,719
can be a mixed bag.

61
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:24,160
A mixed bag is a situation that can have positive and negative aspects.

62
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,040
She also says that it's a culture shock for them, a sense of feeling uncertain

63
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,759
because you're in a different environment to usual.

64
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,560
OK, Beth, I think it's time I revealed the answer to my question.

65
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,240
I asked you what the world record is for the fastest time to set a dinner table.

66
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,879
And I said it was one minute and five seconds.

67
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,439
And that was the right answer. That's not very long, is it?

68
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:55,360
OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this program, starting with open up.

69
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,160
A phrasal verb meaning speak more easily than usual, particularly about worries or problems.

70
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,800
If someone is the funny one or the wise one, they're labelled by that particular characteristic.

71
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,360
To take something with a pinch of salt means you shouldn't believe everything you're told.

72
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,680
Children should be seen and not heard is an old-fashioned phrase that means children should be

73
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,600
quiet and behave well.

74
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,240
A mixed bag means something has both positive and negative aspects.

75
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,720
And finally, a culture shock is an uncertain feeling because you're in a new environment.

76
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,360
