Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,719
And I'm Rob.

5
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,719
How good are you at finding your way from A to B Rob?

6
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:23,920
Can you read a map?

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,120
Oh, come on, Sam. This is the 21st century.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,839
Everyone uses GPS and mobile phone apps to find their way around these days.

9
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,799
True, but before mobile phones were invented,

10
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,520
arriving at your destination wasn't so easy.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,480
At sea, sailors used the stars and sun to navigate,

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,600
to work out which direction they wanted to travel.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,320
And navigating on land was almost impossible with our to compass,

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,799
an instrument for finding directions that uses a magnetic needle

15
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:57,279
which moves to always point north.

16
00:00:57,279 --> 00:00:59,679
But as we'll be hearing in this programme,

17
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:05,120
navigation at sea is easy compared to finding your way in out of space.

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,560
After all, what's up and what's down for astronauts who are floating in zero gravity?

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,759
In space, is there a true north like here on Earth?

20
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:19,439
And how is everything complicated by the fact that all the stars and planets are moving?

21
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,920
Some big questions there, Rob, but first I have a question of my own.

22
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,439
You asked how astronauts know which way is up.

23
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,879
So who better to ask than the first person in space?

24
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:36,960
But who was that? Was it A, Neil Armstrong, B, Uriga Garen,

25
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,000
or C, Valentina Tereshkova?

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,040
Well, Neil Armstrong was the first man on the moon,

27
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,840
but I don't think he was the first person in space,

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,079
so I think it's B, Uriga Garen.

29
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,599
Okay, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

30
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:58,479
Now, let's get back to Rob's earlier question about whether there's such a thing as north in space.

31
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,280
And to answer that, it's first useful to know how north is found on Earth.

32
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,399
Listen to astrophysicist Ethan Segal,

33
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,240
as he explains why a compass always points north

34
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,039
to BBC World Service programme crowd science.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,560
Because Earth behaves like it has a giant bar magnet in it,

36
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,400
and your compass needle will point north towards Earth's magnetic pole.

37
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,640
And we've arbitrarily defined north as that's what we're going to say up is.

38
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,680
Like the north pole, that's as up as you can go.

39
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,599
Planet Earth is like a giant magnet.

40
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,560
Because the needle of a compass is magnetised,

41
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,360
it's attracted to the magnetic pole,

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,000
the points near the north and south poles,

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,199
where the Earth's magnetic field is concentrated.

44
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,119
This explains how we find north,

45
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:55,280
but Ethan points out that the decision to call north up and south down is arbitrary,

46
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,519
decided by random chance not based on any particular reason.

47
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,199
When we look at the world map, we think of north as up.

48
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:08,399
The USA in the northern hemisphere is above Brazil, in the southern hemisphere.

49
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:12,879
But from space, Earth can just as easily be seen the other way up,

50
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,120
with Australia, South Africa and South America at the top.

51
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,360
Both views are equally true.

52
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,840
Wow, that's a mind-blowing thought.

53
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,280
But even though we can argue which direction is up,

54
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,360
it's still true that we can use a compass to navigate on Earth.

55
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,240
However, this simply isn't true in space.

56
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,840
Here's astrophysicist Ethan Segal again to tell Bebesyworld

57
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,000
services crowd science why.

58
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:46,080
The problem with navigating in space is that the magnetic field flips irregularly every few

59
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,400
hundred or few thousand light years.

60
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,280
There's no central object, like the black hole at the center of our galaxy.

61
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,520
It doesn't dominate the whole galaxy.

62
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,080
It doesn't make a magnetic field that you can feel out here 25,

63
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,720
27,000 light years from the center.

64
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,320
So magnetism is not a good guide to navigating in space.

65
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,160
A light year sounds like a measurement of time,

66
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,439
but in fact it measures the distance that light travels in one year,

67
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:24,399
which given that light can travel seven and a half times around the Earth in one second

68
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,399
is a very, very long way.

69
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,199
Around six trillion miles, in fact.

70
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,560
Well, the problem is that every few hundred light years,

71
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,680
the magnetic field flips, turns over or moves into a different position.

72
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,480
So a compass, which depends on magnetism,

73
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,040
is no good for navigating in space.

74
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,920
So how do spacecraft know where they are and which way to go?

75
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,120
The answer is both simple and very clever.

76
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,759
They use specialized heat sensors to detect the position of the sun

77
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,000
and use that to guide their way.

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,840
So simple, yet so ingenious, I'm sure it would have impressed the first person in space

79
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,640
whoever they are.

80
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,520
Mm-hmm.

81
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,920
Yes, in my question, I asked who the first person in space was.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,319
And I said it was B. Uri Gagarin.

83
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,439
I've got to be right, haven't I?

84
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,720
Anyway, it was right.

85
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,600
Of course.

86
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,360
Soviet cosmonaut Uri Gagarin became the first man in space in 1961

87
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,200
with Valentina Tereshkova,

88
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,920
following in his footsteps to become the first woman in space two years later.

89
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,160
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from this program on how to navigate

90
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,240
or find your way in space.

91
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,560
On Earth, you can use a compass,

92
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,720
an instrument with a magnetic needle that moves to point north

93
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,120
that is towards the magnetic pole,

94
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,480
a point near the north or south poles where Earth's magnetic field is strongest.

95
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,759
Saying that north is up is arbitrary,

96
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,680
done randomly, not according to any particular reason or principle.

97
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,959
A light year is a unit measuring the distance that light travels in one year,

98
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,959
around six trillion miles.

99
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,079
And finally, to flip means to turn over or move into a different position.

100
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,079
Once again, our time is up.

101
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,039
Goodbye for now.

102
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:11,680
Bye-bye.
