5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,280
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,320
And I'm Catherine.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,400
Thanks for making it on time today, Catherine.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,800
What do you mean, Neil? Are you implying I'm always late?

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,280
Well, punctuality, I mean being on time is not your strong point.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,760
But I do always turn up and I never miss the programme.

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,439
I just don't want to be early, Neil, and then wait around for you.

12
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,799
Hmm, people's attitude to being on time certainly varies.

13
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,039
And that's what we're discussing in this programme.

14
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,280
How important is punctuality?

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,439
Anyway, Catherine, as you're here on time, you're not going to miss our quiz question.

16
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,320
Oh, no, I certainly don't want to miss out on that.

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,439
So what is it?

18
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,280
Well, in 2011, researchers said that an atomic clock

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,079
at the UK's National Physical Laboratory

20
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,840
would have the best long-term accuracy of any in the world.

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,480
But how many years would it take, approximately,

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,799
for it to lose or gain a second?

23
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,079
Is it a, 138 years, b, 138,000 years,

24
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,960
or c, 138 million years?

25
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,879
Hmm, well, now atomic clocks are very accurate,

26
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:26,159
but 138 million years is a bit extreme.

27
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:31,439
So I'll say b, 138,000 years.

28
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,879
Okay, Catherine, we'll find out the answer before the end of the programme,

29
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:36,479
which has to be six minutes long,

30
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,280
so let's talk more about people's timekeeping.

31
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,000
That's their ability to do things on time.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,560
No, I know Neil doesn't like to be late.

33
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,439
He thinks it's rude, but I might be late,

34
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,679
because the traffic was bad or I had extra things to do.

35
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:55,920
And I know most appointments we make start late.

36
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,359
Well, Catherine, it sounds like you might be a time-bender.

37
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,680
It's something author Grace Pacey talks about on the BBC Woman's Hour programme.

38
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,320
Let's hear her definition of a time-bender.

39
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,520
Well, Jenny, a time-bender is actually somebody we all know very well.

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,120
They are the people who arrive last at any meeting or class,

41
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,479
or the mums whose children have to run into school at the last minute.

42
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,719
They're the people who don't want to be late,

43
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,480
but they have a strange resistance to being early like you,

44
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,799
and they don't allow enough time.

45
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:30,799
Okay, so I might be a time-bender,

46
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:34,239
someone who doesn't allow enough time to get somewhere,

47
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,519
but of course I always think I will have enough time.

48
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,319
One thing that is guaranteed is you'll never be early.

49
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,879
You have a resistance to, you fight against,

50
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,280
or are opposed to, being on time.

51
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,839
Isn't it best to leave home just a little bit earlier?

52
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:50,399
Well, Neil, it's about deadlines.

53
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:53,839
You know, a fixed time when something must be completed by.

54
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,840
If a deadline really matters, I'll make it.

55
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,400
But for less important things, it's not worth getting too stressed.

56
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,319
If you say so, Catherine, being late makes me anxious,

57
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,719
which is why I always arrive early.

58
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:11,439
But therapist, Phillipa Perry, might be able to explain

59
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,840
your more relaxed attitude to time-keeping.

60
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,920
She also spoke about this on the BBC's Woman's Hour programme,

61
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
see if you can hear what her reasons are.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,559
Underlying it all, there is this fear of being early.

63
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:28,719
And the fear could be a fear of being conspicuous,

64
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,319
a fear of standing out in a strange place,

65
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,159
of having no one to talk to, feeling a bit alone and awkward.

66
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,719
The other reason people are always late is that

67
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,959
all the traffic lights will be green.

68
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,799
And they generally sort of stretch the time somehow in their minds

69
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,120
and just think this time to do absolutely everything they packed in.

70
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,800
So she thinks being late is to do with social awkwardness.

71
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,280
If you arrive too soon, you feel awkward.

72
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,880
That's uncomfortable or nervous, waiting for others to arrive.

73
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,400
There's also the fear of being conspicuous,

74
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,600
easily noticed or standing out in the crowd.

75
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,000
It's a very uncomfortable feeling,

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,080
but that's not why I might be late.

77
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,680
It's the other reason Phillipa Perry mentioned.

78
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,000
I just think there's time to pack everything in.

79
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,879
But if it makes you happy, I will try to be on time next time.

80
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,319
Well, according to experts on the Woman's Hour programme,

81
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:28,079
you shouldn't try to be on time.

82
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,240
You should decide to be on time.

83
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,840
Ah, okay, yeah.

84
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,639
But before we run out of time,

85
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,160
why don't you tell me if I have the right answer to the quiz?

86
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,519
Was I correct?

87
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,240
Yes, I asked you how many years it would take

88
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,759
approximately for the UK's National Physical Laboratory

89
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,040
Atomic Clock to lose or gain a second?

90
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,759
Is it A, 138 years?

91
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,560
B, 138,000 years?

92
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,519
Or C, 138,000 years?

93
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,280
And I said B, 138,000 years.

94
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,960
And you are wrong.

95
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,079
You are too early.

96
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,400
You are too early for a change.

97
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,800
The answer is C, 138,000,000 years.

98
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,439
Maybe I should buy you an atomic watch, Catherine.

99
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,960
Oh, right.

100
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Let's not waste any more time.

101
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,560
Here's a recap of the vocabulary we've discussed today

102
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,480
starting with punctuality.

103
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,080
This is about doing something at an agreed time

104
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,000
and being on time.

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,080
When we talk about someone's time keeping,

106
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,960
we mean their ability to achieve things on time.

107
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,680
And we heard about time benders.

108
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,240
Not really people who bend time,

109
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,519
but people who are always late because they don't allow

110
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,360
enough time to get somewhere.

111
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,040
Like you, Catherine, maybe.

112
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,000
It's because you have a resistance to being on time.

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,600
You are against being on time.

114
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,800
You fight against it.

115
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,960
That's because I hate deadlines.

116
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,400
Fixed times when things must be completed by.

117
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,360
And some people also feel conspicuous,

118
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,319
easily noticed, and they feel awkward,

119
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,240
uncomfortable or nervous.

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,319
