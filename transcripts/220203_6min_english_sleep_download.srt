Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,039
And I'm Neil.

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,679
Sleep. We all need it. Some more than others. I can usually get by with around 7 hours

5
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:31,600
a night, but I do like to have an app, a short sleep in the afternoon when I'm not working, of course.

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,039
How about you, Neil?

7
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:38,079
I'm always tired, and as soon as my head hits the pillow, I'm out like a light,

8
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,159
meaning I go to sleep very quickly.

9
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,879
Well, Neil, you might not survive in South Korea, then. Apparently, it's one of the most

10
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:51,120
stressed and tired nations on Earth. A place where people work and study longer hours and get

11
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:57,359
less sleep than anywhere else. We'll find out more later and teach some sleep-related vocabulary.

12
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,759
But before we do, you need to give me a question to keep me awake and alert.

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,200
Of course I do, and here it is. In the 1960s, American man Randy Gardner

14
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,519
set the world record for staying awake for the longest period. Do you know what that time was?

15
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:23,519
A, 64 hours. B, 164 hours. C, 264 hours.

16
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,519
Or sound impossible, but I'll guess A, 64 hours. That's nearly three days.

17
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:35,120
Well, I'll give you the answer later in the program, assuming you don't dose off.

18
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,640
But let's talk more about sleep now. As I mentioned, we all need it to help our mind and body

19
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,159
rest and relax. And going without sleep or sleeplessness is bad for our health.

20
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:54,640
Many things can stop us sleeping and some of them are pressure, anxiety and stress caused by your job.

21
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,879
And in South Korea, research has shown it's increasingly difficult to switch off. Stop thinking

22
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:06,960
about work and relax. South Koreans sleep fewer hours and have higher rates of depression and

23
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:12,719
suicide than almost anywhere else. C, Wankoo has been reporting on this for the BBC World

24
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:19,280
Service documentary podcast. He met one worker who explained why she never got time to relax.

25
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,879
Separating work and rest time has been a recurring issue for Chile.

26
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,400
In her last job, her office hours were long. Like most Korean firms, her employer didn't think

27
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,879
about any boundaries. They encroached on almost all her time. They told me you need to be

28
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,080
contactable 24-7. There will always be someone from work reaching out to me like you need to get

29
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,159
this done right now. I'm even just thinking about it like I get really agitated.

30
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:56,400
So that stressed out worker got agitated just thinking about the situation. She got worried or upset.

31
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:02,879
That's because office hours in South Korea are long and some employers expect their workers to be

32
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:09,360
contactable all the time. Yes, there are no boundaries, so no limits or rules about when

33
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,840
employers can contact their employees. Therefore, as this employee said work encroached,

34
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,439
it gradually took over her leisure time. Stress like this can lead to insomnia,

35
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:27,039
a condition where you are unable to sleep. The BBC Discovery podcast goes on to explain that

36
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:33,039
offering a cure for this sleep business has become big business. There are sleep clinics where

37
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:39,520
doctors assess people overnight and sleep cafes that offer places to nap in the middle of the working

38
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:45,120
day. One other issue in South Korea that's affecting sleep is the Bali-Bali culture,

39
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,680
meaning quickly, quickly or hurry, hurry. People are constantly in a rush. Dr Lee spoke to the

40
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,920
World Services Discovery podcast about the effects of this and how even trying to take medication

41
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:08,800
to help sleep has its problems. People take like 10 or 20 pills per one night and because they

42
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:15,040
cannot follow sleep even with the medication they drink alcohol on top of that and they experience

43
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:22,159
the side effects of the medication. People can sleepwalk and go to the refrigerator,

44
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:29,039
eat a lot of things unconsciously, uncooked food and they don't remember next day.

45
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:35,279
There were cases of car accidents in the center of Seoul, which has been a sleepwalking patient.

46
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,399
So some people are taking lots of pills to help them sleep, but they're not working, so they're

47
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:48,239
drinking alcohol as well. This leads to side effects, unpleasant and unexpected results from the

48
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:54,560
medication. It seems one of these side effects is sleepwalking, moving around and doing things

49
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,079
whilst still asleep. Well, if sleeping pills aren't working, there's always meditation or working

50
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:05,679
less. At least South Koreans are guessing sunsleep, unlike Randy Gardner, who I asked you about

51
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:10,959
earlier. Yes, he holds the record for staying awake the longest and I thought he stayed awake for

52
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:19,120
64 hours. Was I right? Oh, no Neil, not long enough. Randy Gardner stayed awake for an incredible

53
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:30,240
264.4 hours. That's 11 days and 25 minutes in January 1964. That's one record I really don't want to

54
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,079
beat. Well, before you nod off Neil, let's recap some of the vocabulary we've been discussing,

55
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:41,919
including go out like a light, which means you go to sleep very quickly. When you switch off,

56
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,279
you stop concentrating on one thing and start thinking about something else. A lack of sleep or

57
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:54,799
rest can make you agitated. You get worried or upset. Incroach means gradually take over. When you

58
00:05:54,799 --> 00:06:01,120
take medication and it gives you unpleasant and unexpected results, we call these side effects.

59
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,639
And sleepwalking describes moving around and doing things while still asleep.

60
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,120
That's our six minutes up. Goodbye and see dreams. Goodbye.
