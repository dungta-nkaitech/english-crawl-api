00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,359
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,320
And I'm Sam.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,080
And in this programme we're looking at the word Objectification.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,080
Objectification is when we reduce people to objects.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,800
An example of this is advertising in the media

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,679
and in particular the way women have been shown.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,679
Impossibly attractive and implausibly perfect models.

12
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:39,679
In adverts and in movies and on TV you are much more likely to see naked or half-naked women than men.

13
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:45,280
Objectification can lead to issues in society such as inequality and discrimination.

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,079
Objectification of women is a problem.

15
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,039
But what about the objectification of men?

16
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,159
Before we hear more it's time for a question.

17
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:57,679
Today's question is on British TV in which decade

18
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,320
was a completely naked man first seen.

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,280
Was it A the 1940s, B the 1950s or C the 1960s?

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,159
What do you think Sam?

21
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,599
I'm going for the 60s.

22
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:09,920
I'll give the answer later in the programme.

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,079
Now Sam do you know the TV programme Love Island?

24
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,400
Yes it's a kind of dating show and all the contestants,

25
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,319
men and women spend a lot of time in their swimming costumes

26
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,319
and they've all got perfect bodies.

27
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:27,599
Yes that's right it's a programme that seems to objectify

28
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:30,640
men and women equally but is that a bad thing?

29
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:36,959
Dr Peter Lucas is senior lecturer in philosophy at the University of Central Lancashire.

30
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,879
He spoke on this topic on the BBC's Woman's Hour programme.

31
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,519
What does he suggest might be the advantage of featuring men with perfect bodies?

32
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,399
If you look at the impact of TV series like Love Island for instance,

33
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,359
the producers of that programme present that have described it as being aspirational for their

34
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:00,400
audience. It's presenting role models, it's presenting models that people are supposed to aspire to.

35
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,319
Now many women thinking about the male bodies on display there might think well

36
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,319
if it means that more men get off to the gym and sort of look after themselves physically,

37
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,520
surely that's a good thing.

38
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,960
So what might be an advantage of these highly fit athletic bodies on show?

39
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,719
Dr Lucas suggests that seeing those bodies might encourage men to go to the gym

40
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,120
and work hard to improve their fitness and health and that could be a good thing.

41
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,200
Yes, the people in the programme are described as role models.

42
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,080
A role model is someone whose behaviour is seen as a good example for others to copy.

43
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,600
I'm not sure the behaviour of the people in Love Island makes them good role models

44
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,280
but perhaps from the point of view of their physical fitness they give us something to aspire to.

45
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,480
If you aspire to something it's something you can aim for, something you want to achieve.

46
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,599
Dr Lucas also used a related word aspirational.

47
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,159
The TV series Love Island was described as being aspirational.

48
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,919
It shows a lifestyle that people would like to have something they might aim to achieve.

49
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,079
But there are also dangers to encouraging people to get to the gym.

50
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:11,759
Here's Dr Lucas again.

51
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:19,199
But also it's likely to generate a higher levels of narcissism, self-consciousness,

52
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,719
becoming obsessive about your appearance is not particularly an attractive feature

53
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,919
rather in men or in women.

54
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:29,599
I suspect that that's impacting on men's behaviour in a way which is detrimental in the same sort of way

55
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,799
that's been detrimental for women really for decades.

56
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,479
He talks about behaviour that is detrimental.

57
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:39,439
This means behaviour that has a negative impact.

58
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,079
What behaviours does he say are detrimental?

59
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:46,639
If people become obsessed by their appearance it could lead to narcissism.

60
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:51,199
This is a condition where you spend so much time focusing on yourself,

61
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,519
your own looks, your own body that you stop caring about anyone else.

62
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,879
And because it's very very hard to get that kind of body it can also lead to people being

63
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,399
very self-conscious. They might become embarrassed about their bodies and lose confidence in themselves

64
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:11,919
as a result. Right, it's almost time to review this week's vocabulary, but before that let's

65
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:18,319
have the answer to the quiz. In what decade was the first naked man seen on British TV?

66
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:24,639
Was it A, the 1940s, B, the 1950s? We'll see the 1960s. What did you say Sam?

67
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,319
I said C, the 60s.

68
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,319
I'm afraid the revolution had come earlier than that.

69
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:36,560
The correct answer is the 1950s. It was a 1957 documentary called Out of Step,

70
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,959
part of which was filmed at a nudist colony.

71
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,839
Now time for our vocabulary.

72
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:48,879
Our first word was objectification. This is the noun for when we reduce a human being to an object.

73
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,519
We don't think of them as a real person anymore. The verb is to objectify.

74
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,399
Someone whose behaviour is a good example that others want to copy is a role model.

75
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,800
When it comes to presenting six minute English you are my role model Neil.

76
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,960
Are you two kind and are here spire to your level of professionalism, Sam?

77
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,960
To aspire to, to aim to be, to hope to achieve.

78
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,439
That is related to the next word, aspirational. This adjective is used to describe the desire to

79
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:22,400
improve parts of your life, for example, getting a better job or a better body.

80
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,639
Aspirational TV programmes or adverts show lifestyles that people might want to be theirs.

81
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,519
Our next word is an adjective for something that is bad for you, something that has a negative

82
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:40,079
effect. The adjective is detrimental. We heard that aspiring to the perfect body can be detrimental

83
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:45,360
because it might lead to narcissism. Narcissism is the term for someone who is so obsessed with

84
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,120
their own body and life that they don't care about anyone else.

85
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,159
Achieving that perfect body is incredibly hard and impossible for most real people

86
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,840
and not achieving it can make people overly self-conscious.

87
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,600
Which in this situation means that they can lose confidence in themselves.

88
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,320
That's all we have time for today. Do join us next time and remember you can find us on

90
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,280
Bye.
