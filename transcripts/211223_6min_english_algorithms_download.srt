4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,519
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,320
I'm Neil.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,359
And I'm Sam.

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,359
What do shopping with a credit card,

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,000
finding love through internet dating and waiting for the traffic lights to change,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,039
have in common?

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,679
Hmm. They all involve computers.

11
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:33,679
Good guess, Sam, but how exactly do those computers work?

12
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,280
The answer is that they all use algorithms,

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,359
sets of mathematical instructions which find solutions to problems.

14
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:43,600
Although they are often hidden,

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,679
algorithms are all around us.

16
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:48,719
From mobile phone maps to home delivery pizza,

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,200
they play a big part of modern life.

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,439
And they're the topic of this programme.

19
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,120
A simple way to think of algorithms is as recipes.

20
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,399
To make pancakes, you mix flour, eggs and milk,

21
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,359
then melt butter in a frying pan, and so on.

22
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,840
Computers do this in a more complicated way

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,759
by repeating mathematical equations over and over again.

24
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:14,319
Equations are mathematical sentences showing how two things are equal.

25
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:16,000
They're similar to algorithms,

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,799
and the most famous scientific equation of all,

27
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,000
Einstein's e equals mc squared,

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,200
can be thought of as a three-part algorithm.

29
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,240
But before my brain gets squashed by all this maths,

30
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,640
I have a quiz question for you, Sam.

31
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,879
As you know, Einstein's famous equation is e equals mc squared.

32
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,280
But what does the e stand for?

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,480
Is it a electricity, b energy, or c, everything?

34
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,560
I'm tempted to say e is for everything,

35
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,800
but I reckon I know the answer.

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,040
B e stands for energy.

37
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,719
Okay, Sam, we'll find out if you're right later in the programme.

38
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,879
With all this talk of computers, you might think algorithms are a new idea.

39
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,159
In fact, they've been around since Babylonian times,

40
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,159
around 4,000 years ago.

41
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,640
And their use today can be controversial.

42
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,519
Some algorithms used in internet search engines

43
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,000
have been accused of racial prejudice.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,360
Ramesh Sunivasan is Professor of Information Studies

45
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,599
at the University of California.

46
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,360
Here's what he said when asked what the word algorithm actually means

47
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,079
by BBC World Service programme, The Forum.

48
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:29,360
My understanding of the term algorithm is it's not necessarily the boogie man

49
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,360
or it's not necessarily something that is, you know, inscrutable or mysterious to all people.

50
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,960
It's the set of instructions that you write in some mathematical form

51
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,560
or in some software code.

52
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,560
So it's a repeated set of instructions that are sequenced,

53
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,120
that are used and applied to answer a question or resolve a problem.

54
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,800
It's as simple as that actually.

55
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,520
Something that algorithms have been controversial,

56
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,759
but Professor Sunivasan says they are not necessarily the bogeyman.

57
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,400
The bogeyman refers to something people call bad or evil to make other people afraid.

58
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,920
Professor Sunivasan thinks algorithms are neither evil nor inscrutable,

59
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,080
not showing emotions or thoughts and therefore very difficult to understand.

60
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,480
Still, it can be difficult to understand exactly what algorithms are,

61
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,680
especially when there are many different types of them.

62
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,360
So let's take an example.

63
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,640
It's autumn and we want to collect all the apples from our orchard and divide them into three groups.

64
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,800
Big, medium and small.

65
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,880
One method is to collect all the apples together and compare their sizes.

66
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,120
But doing this would take hours.

67
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,200
It's much easier to first collect the apples from only one tree,

68
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,319
divide those into big, medium or small,

69
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,479
and then repeat the process for the other trees, one by one.

70
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,799
That's basically what algorithms do.

71
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,759
They find the most efficient way to get things done.

72
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,799
Or in other words, get the best results in the quickest time.

73
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,479
Mathematics Professor Ian Stewart agrees.

74
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,719
Listen as he explains how the algorithm called bubble sort

75
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,599
works to BBC World Service Program the forum.

76
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:16,959
Think of when your computer is sorting emails by date,

77
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,639
and maybe you've got 500 emails, and it sorts them by date in a flash.

78
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,839
Now, it doesn't use bubble sort, but it does use a sorting method.

79
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,680
And if you tried to do that by hand, it would take you a very long time,

80
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,959
whatever method you used.

81
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,040
Professor Stewart describes how algorithms sort emails.

82
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,519
To sort is a verb, meaning to group together things which share similarities.

83
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:42,159
Just like grouping the apples by size,

84
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:46,000
sorting hundreds of emails by hand would take a long time.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,599
But using algorithms, computers do it in a flash very quickly or suddenly.

86
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:56,399
That phrase in a flash reminds me of how Albert Einstein came up with his famous

87
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,680
equation E equals MC squared.

88
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,799
And that reminds me of your quiz question.

89
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:06,639
You asked about the E in E equals MC squared.

90
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:09,519
I said it stands for energy, so was I right?

91
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,439
Energy is the correct answer.

92
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:16,560
Energy equals M for mass multiplied by the constant C,

93
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,479
which is the speed of light squared.

94
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:24,159
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from this program starting with equation,

95
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:28,719
a mathematical statement using symbols to show two equal things.

96
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:33,599
If something is called a bogeyman, it's something considered bad and to be feared.

97
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,480
Inscrutable people don't show their emotions, so they are very difficult to get to know.

98
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,400
Efficient means working quickly and effectively in an organized way.

99
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,960
The verb to sort means to group together things which share similarities.

100
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,920
And finally, if something happens in a flash, it happens quickly or suddenly.

101
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,879
That's all the time we have to discuss algorithms.

102
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,720
And if you're still not 100% sure about exactly what they are,

103
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,439
we hope at least you've learned some useful vocabulary.
