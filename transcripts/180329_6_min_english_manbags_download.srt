5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,839
Welcome to 6 Minute English, the programme where we explore an interesting topic

6
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:20,960
and bring you some useful items of vocabulary. I'm Rob.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,039
And I'm Neil and today we are discussing man bags.

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,640
Yes, man bags. They're the height of fashion at the moment,

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,600
a stylish accessory that modern men are carrying.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,719
An accessory is an additional item added to something to make it more useful or attractive.

11
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,840
I'm not so sure, Rob. I mean, I wouldn't be seen dead carrying a man bag.

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,120
Really? So what do you carry your loose change, your credit cards,

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,719
tickets and mobile phone in?

14
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,519
I just stuff everything into my pockets, Rob.

15
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:51,519
It's better than being a laughing stock,

16
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:53,519
carrying a handbag around.

17
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:57,359
By laughing stock, you mean everyone thinking of you as silly.

18
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,840
But you wouldn't be because it's a man bag, Neil, not a woman's handbag.

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,359
Maybe I can convince you to change your mind by the end of the programme.

20
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,319
But now, let's not forget to ask you today's question.

21
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,799
Is it about man bags by any chance?

22
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,680
It is. So it might be tricky for you to answer.

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,400
According to Market Research Company Mintel,

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,239
how many men bought a man bag in the UK last year?

25
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,400
What is a 5%?

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,680
B 15% or C 25%.

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,200
Well, obviously not many, so I'm going to say 5%.

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,720
And I'm not one of them.

29
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
Right, OK, you've made that very clear.

30
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,520
We'll find out the answer at the end of the programme anyway.

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,240
Now, let's talk more about man bags.

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,400
For hundreds of years, women have carried their possessions around in handbags,

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,440
so why can't a man do the same with a man bag?

34
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,480
Maybe it's the name. Why can't it just be a bag?

35
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,880
Why does a bag have to have a gender?

36
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,440
It's a trend, Neil, a stylish, fashion item designed to look good on men.

37
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,840
Many big names have flocked to adopt the trend for L Williams, David Beckham,

38
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,719
and Kanye West are just some of those who've been spotted rocking a man bag.

39
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,439
Rocking is an informal way of saying wearing.

40
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,240
But what's wrong with a sturdy briefcase?

41
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,960
Sturdy means strong and not easily damaged.

42
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,680
Are you saying man bags are just fashionable?

43
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,199
No, they're practical too.

44
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,919
We've always needed bags to carry stuff around,

45
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,400
but what we carry these days has changed.

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,120
You know, laptops, mobiles, even our lunch.

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,480
So why not have a trendy looking bag to carry these things around in?

48
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,520
I think part of the problem is carrying one.

49
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,240
It's not seen as very British by some people.

50
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,680
We're not always as stylish as some of our European neighbours, are we?

51
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,439
Well, speak for yourself, Neil.

52
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,240
But Nick Carvelle, GQ contributing fashion editor, has a reason for this.

53
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,000
Here he is speaking on BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,520
When Britain were still very tied up with that idea of masculinity that is almost so fragile

55
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,400
that it can be dented by carrying a bag.

56
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,080
We think a lot about that in this country in a way that I don't think a lot of European men do.

57
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:06,400
So Nick, Phil, some British men are still tied up with the idea of masculinity.

58
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,400
These are the characteristics traditionally thought to be typical of men.

59
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,680
And for us British men, these characteristics are fragile.

60
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,520
They can easily be broken.

61
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,080
Yes, we can also call it manliness.

62
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,800
Things like not crying during a sad film.

63
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,680
It's a slightly old-fashioned idea, but it could still be dented or affected if a man was

64
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,200
caught carrying a manbag.

65
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,439
Whereas some European men don't give it a lot of thought according to Nick Carvelle.

66
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,600
But with people like Louis Vuisson, Fendi, Gucci and Dolce and Gabbana designing these bags,

67
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,320
they're bound to have a hefty price tag.

68
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,280
That's an informal way of saying a high price.

69
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,760
Well, fashion comes at a price, Neil.

70
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,680
You need to shake off your inhibitions.

71
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,439
That's a feeling of embarrassment that stops you from doing something.

72
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,840
And if you really want to be on trend, you could also splash out on a murs

73
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,840
at some man's purse or a moat, a man's tote bag.

74
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,879
Have I convinced you?

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,439
No, not really, Rob.

76
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,439
I have a feeling that a manbag by any other name is well, a bag.

77
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,520
And I have one, my trusty backpack.

78
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,120
Well, for some people, manbags are the thing.

79
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,360
But, as I asked earlier, according to market research company Mintel,

80
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,840
how many men actually bought a manbag in the UK last year?

81
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,800
Was it A, 5%, B, 15%, or C, 25%.

82
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,319
And I said, A, 5%.

83
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:30,160
Come on, I must have been right.

84
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,840
Well, you were wrong, Neil.

85
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,400
The answer was actually 15%.

86
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,319
Anilia quarter of 16 to 34-year-olds have bought one.

87
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,920
Well, as I say, Rob, a good practical backpack is for me.

88
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,160
But now, shall we unpack some of the vocabulary we've discussed today?

89
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,920
Starting with accessory, which is an additional item added to something

90
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,160
to make it more useful or attractive.

91
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,320
A tie is a smart accessory to wear with a suit.

92
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,680
Maybe, but you wouldn't catch me wearing a suit in my media job.

93
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,080
It's all T-shirts and jeans for us.

94
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,240
If I came to work in a suit, I would be a laughing stock.

95
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,680
I mean, I would be seen as someone who people think of a silly.

96
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,240
Our next word was sturdy.

97
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,600
Something that is sturdy is strong and not easily damaged.

98
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,840
If you're walking up a mountain, you need to wear some sturdy walking boots.

99
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,960
Good advice if I was going up a mountain, which I'm not.

100
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,000
Next, we mentioned masculinity.

101
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,920
These are the characteristics that are traditionally thought to be typical of men.

102
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,480
So we sometimes refer to as being macho,

103
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,480
like Neil went swimming in ice cold water to prove his masculinity.

104
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,920
That I would never do.

105
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,760
I'd rather carry a manbag, despite their hefty price tag.

106
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,439
That means high price.

107
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,000
Finally, we also mentioned the word inhibitions.

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,079
That's feelings of embarrassment that stop you from doing something.

109
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,920
Neils inhibitions are stopping him from carrying a manbag.

110
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,079
It's a bag, Rob. Just a bag.

111
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,360
But we've talked enough about this, so that's it for this edition of Six Minute English.

112
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,560
But before you rush off to purchase a designer manbag,

113
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,800

Bye for now.

115
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,240
