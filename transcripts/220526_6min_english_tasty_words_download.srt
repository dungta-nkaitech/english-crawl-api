00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,039
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,839
And I'm Sam. Many people have favourites.

6
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,440
My favourite colour, my favourite flavour, my favourite word.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,400
What's yours, Neil?

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,280
Hmm, my favourite colour is green.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,600
My favourite flavour is sweet and sour.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,800
And, well, I don't know if it's my favourite, but there is a word I really like saying out loud.

11
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,079
Ninkam poop. It means a silly person.

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,120
For me, it's the taste of coffee and the smell of lavender or freshly baked bread.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,200
Our favourite tastes, smells and colours are controlled by our five senses.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,760
Sight, sound, smell, taste and touch.

15
00:00:54,159 --> 00:01:00,799
For most of us, they don't mix. We see colours and taste flavours, but we can't taste sounds.

16
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,359
But that's not how everyone's brain works.

17
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,280
Imagine being able to taste every word that you hear.

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,200
In this programme, we'll meet two sisters from Glasgow in Scotland

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,159
who can do just that. And as usual, we'll learn some new vocabulary as well.

20
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,479
Julie McDowell and her younger sister, Jen McCready, have synesthesia,

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,800
a neurological condition where two or more senses mix together.

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:31,600
When synestheats, as they are called, hear a word, their sense of taste also becomes activated.

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,560
Words produce specific tastes on their tongues.

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,560
For example, when Jen hears the name of her daughter, Sophia, she tastes pink marshmallows.

25
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,880
And the name Leo tastes like noodles.

26
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,920
Well, hear more from the unusual sisters later, but first I have a question for you, Neil.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,519
We've just heard what happens when Jen McCready hears the names Sophia and Leo.

28
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,719
But what does she taste when she hears the name?

29
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:06,640
Neil. Is it A, eggs and bacon, B, spaghetti hoops, or C, a jam sandwich?

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,800
Well, I don't know what this says about me, Sam, but I'm going to guess that it's C, a jam sandwich.

31
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,080
Okay, don't worry, Neil. I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

32
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,000
Synesthesia isn't only about people like Julie and Jen who taste words.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,200
It can be a mixing of any of our senses, a synesthet may hear colours or see sounds.

34
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,880
In fact, there could be as many as 150 different types of synesthesia.

35
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,480
For the Scottish sisters having synesthesia is a gift, something Jen explained when she talked with

36
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,360
BBC World Service programme, the Food Chain.

37
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,840
It's enjoyable. It's never anything that causes the only thing I always say is it's quite hard

38
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,640
for you to try and eat healthily because if you hear a word that maybe tastes like tuna,

39
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,880
I'll be like, oh, I need to get a tuna baguette now.

40
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,440
You know it's almost like being pregnant and having a craving.

41
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,840
Words can be so vivid that you just want to eat that. That's the only negative I would say about it.

42
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,240
For Jen, the only drawback to synesthesia is that it can be hard to eat healthily,

43
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:17,200
because hearing certain words produces a craving, a strong feeling of wanting a particular food.

44
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,240
That could be because, for Jen, the sound of the word is so vivid, clear,

45
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,480
detailed and powerful in her mind.

46
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,000
There's still much doctors don't know about why some people experience sense mixing,

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,600
while most of us experience each sense in isolation.

48
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,200
But it's clear that for Julie and Jen, synesthesia makes the world a more interesting,

49
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,479
colorful place.

50
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:45,439
Someone who can explain why so little is known about synesthesia is Guy Letchzina,

51
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:51,599
consultant neurologist at King's College London, an author of the book The Man Who Tasted Words.

52
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,199
Here he is speaking to BBC World Services, The Food Chain.

53
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,399
One of the problems with synesthesia is for many years it's been dismissed and it's been viewed as

54
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:06,000
people with an overactive imagination, something not real.

55
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,439
But actually what research in recent years has taught us is that it does have an underlying

56
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,599
neurological and genetic basis.

57
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,360
Guy says that in the past synesthesia was often dismissed,

58
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,920
considered unimportant or uninteresting.

59
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,639
Synesthetes were labelled people with overactive imaginations,

60
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,600
a tendency to imagine things that are not true.

61
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,000
But research is showing that the cause of synesthesia could run in the family.

62
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,439
Julie and Jen's brothers don't have synesthesia, but Jen's daughter does.

63
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,959
And with an estimated 4% of the world population having some form of sense mixing,

64
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,279
a world of new and exciting possibilities is opening up to millions.

65
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,959
Exciting possibilities like tasting someone's name.

66
00:04:52,959 --> 00:05:00,160
Remember in my question I asked what synesthetes Jen McCready tastes when she hears the name Neil.

67
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,560
Okay well I guess that Neil tastes like a jam sandwich.

68
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,520
Was I right?

69
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,480
Well Neil no, you don't taste like a jam sandwich.

70
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,760
In fact when Jen hears the name Neil she tastes spaghetti hoops.

71
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,120
Oh well it could be worse, the name Robert makes Jen taste rotten eggs.

72
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,200
Sorry to any Robert's listening.

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,879
Okay let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this program about synesthesia,

74
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,199
a neurological condition where two or more senses mix together.

75
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,920
A ninkam poop is an informal way of saying a silly person.

76
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,040
A craving for something is the strong desire to have it.

77
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,399
A vivid sensation is clear, strong and detailed in your mind.

78
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,240
When something is dismissed it's considered unimportant or uninteresting.

79
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:54,800
And finally an overactive imagination is the tendency to imagine things that are not true.

80
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,920
Once again our six minutes are up.

81
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,240
If you've enjoyed this look into the weird and wonderful world of synesthesia

82
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,120
we hope you'll join us again next time for more chat, interesting issues and useful

83
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,720
vocabulary here at Six Minute English. Bye for now.

84
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,199
Goodbye.
