Hello, this is six minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam and I'm Neil

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:26,120
It's nice to see you Neil smiley face high five fist bump. What is this Sam? Are you saying hello with emojis?

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:35,280
Yes, I am in this program. We're entering the world of emojis the small characters people use to show emotions in texts and emails

5
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,719
Do you have a favorite emoji Neil?

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:46,640
Mines that crying tears of laughter emoji. I like the smiling face with hearts one and with over three thousand emojis to choose from

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,400
There's one for every occasion

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,560
It's one of the reasons why emojis have become so popular over the last 20 years

9
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:59,240
They let people put back some of the human emotion that's missing in written texts and emails

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,240
We'll be finding out more about emojis and learning some related vocabulary soon

11
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:06,600
But first I have a question for you Neil

12
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:15,480
It's about the word emoji itself which was invented in 1999 in Japan for the first internet enabled mobile phones

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,359
The name emoji comes from the combination of two Japanese words

14
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:32,159
But which words is the word emoji a combination of a face and emotion be picture and character or see message and image

15
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,079
I'll say it's a face and emotion. Okay, Neil

16
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,079
We'll find out if your answer gets a thumbs up at the end of the program

17
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:49,319
When we talk with someone face to face we use physical gestures like smiling, laughing or nodding to show the other person how we feel

18
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:54,959
But these gestures get lost in written communication. That's where emojis come in

19
00:01:54,959 --> 00:02:00,359
They add feeling and emotion to online messages, but not everyone is an emoji fan

20
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:10,000
Some people believe that carefully chosen words are the best way of expressing yourself and that emojis are affecting our ability to put feelings into words

21
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:16,319
Here's cognitive linguist professor Viv Evans author of a book about the language of emojis

22
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:20,439
Explaining more to BBC radio force word of mouth

23
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,840
A lot of people you know language mavens the grammar police and so on

24
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:31,919
Will say have the sort of jaundiced prejudice view about emoji that's taking us back to the dark ages of a literacy

25
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,879
Bring back Shakespeare and stick to the language of Shakespeare and all the rest of it

26
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,359
But that fundamentally misunderstands the nature of communication

27
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,759
Emoji is important in fact it makes us more effective communicators in the digital age

28
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,239
Viv Evans describes people who don't approve of emojis as the grammar police a

29
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:59,280
slang term referring to people who want to see formal language and grammar what they call correct English

30
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:07,719
Written online the grammar police criticize modern stars of English and like to correct other people's mistakes in spelling and grammar

31
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:13,199
According to professor Evans the grammar police have a jaundiced view of emojis

32
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:18,199
They only see the negative side of them because of their own ideas and experiences

33
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:26,119
What's more they think emojis are taking us back to the dark ages of illiteracy when most people couldn't read or write

34
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,399
If someone refers to the dark ages they mean a past time in history considered

35
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:38,159
Uncivilized and characterized by ignorance but luckily for emoji fans the grammar police are in the minority

36
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:44,400
Over six billion emoji messages are sent around the world every day with about

37
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,240
70% containing emotion-based characters like smiley face and blowing kisses

38
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:56,359
According to professor Evans emoji users are more expressive more effective communicators

39
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,680
So could that be an advantage for someone looking for love online?

40
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:06,719
That's what Michael Rosen presenter of BBC Radio 4's word of mouth wanted to find out

41
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,840
Is it possible to start a relationship using emoji?

42
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,240
Well, there is the research that's been conducted by match.com the American based

43
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:23,519
Dating site and what they found based on their research is that the people that use more emojis

44
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,839
tend to be luckier in love they have more success in terms of dating in the digital age

45
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,639
Using emoji makes us more effective communicators

46
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,160
expressive in more expressive

47
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:39,760
We're better able to express our emotional selves and people therefore it stands to reason if you use more emojis

48
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,760
You're gonna get more dates

49
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,000
For people who are dating or starting a romantic relationship with someone

50
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,680
It seems that using emojis helps them be lucky in love an expression meaning lucky in finding a romantic partner

51
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,520
emojis let us show our true personality

52
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,480
So professor Evans says it stands to reason in other words

53
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:07,040
It seems likely to be true that emoji users get more dates and that's a big thumbs up from me

54
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,840
What about our question Sam did my answer get a thumbs up to in my question?

55
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:20,480
I asked you which words combine to make up the Japanese word emoji and I guessed it was a face and emotion

56
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,879
Which was sad face the wrong answer I'm afraid in fact

57
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,639
emoji combines the words for picture and character in Japanese

58
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:35,639
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned about emojis starting with the grammar police

59
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:41,519
People who want correct spelling and grammar online and criticize those who don't if you have a

60
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:48,759
jaundiced view of something you only see the negative side because of your own bad experience with it the dark ages

61
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:57,480
describes a period in history characterized by ignorance and a lack of progress if you are dating someone you are spending time with them

62
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:04,039
romantically which means you are lucky in love an expression meaning lucky in finding a romantic partner and

63
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,800
Finally the phrase it stands to reason means that something seems likely to be true or it makes sense

64
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:14,959
Once again our six minutes are up by for now. Bye

65
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,919
six minutes from the BBC
