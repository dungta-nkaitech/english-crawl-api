00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,080
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,000
And I'm Neil. I'm feeling a bit chilly today, Alice.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,039
Yes, it is unseasonably cold today,

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,839
which means not normal for the time of year,

8
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,519
but the weather is very unpredictable these days.

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:27,679
I know what you mean.

10
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,800
Global warming is the subject of today's show.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,679
Is global warming really something to worry about?

12
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,560
Some people say that the earth has warmed up in the past,

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,320
and nothing terrible's happened.

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,240
The earth has warmed up before,

15
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,920
but this was the result of things like wobbles in the earth's orbit,

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,000
not because of an increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Can we reverse the changes?

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,600
No, it's too late.

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,039
And now we have to find ways to adapt to extreme weather,

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,399
rising sea levels and melting polar ice caps.

21
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,320
However, we can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,400
or make them less harmful.

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,640
But before we talk more about this, I have a question for you.

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,759
How much has the average temperature of the earth's surface

25
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:14,239
increased in the last 100 years?

26
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,599
Is it a 0.85 degrees Celsius,

27
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:21,840
b 1.85 degrees Celsius,

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,200
or c 8.5 degrees Celsius?

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,760
I'm going to go for the big one. 8.5.

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,960
Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right later on, Neil.

31
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,439
But first, do you know any ways to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions?

32
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,640
I do, actually.

33
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,400
An Argentinian company has started collecting cow emissions

34
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,520
and converting them into usable energy.

35
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,240
Well, as the world eats more meat,

36
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,080
methane emissions from livestock

37
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,799
are actually becoming a bigger climate concern.

38
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,920
And one day's worth of cow emissions

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,000
provides energy to run a car for 24 hours.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,679
OK, moving on now.

41
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:04,719
So the world is going to have to adapt to global warming

42
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,680
since we can't turn back the clock on climate change.

43
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,560
And rich countries have the resources to do this,

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,039
whilst poorer countries don't.

45
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,879
Let's hear from Salim al-Huk,

46
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,360
director of the International Centre for Climate Change

47
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,120
and Development in Bangladesh,

48
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,560
talking about how this problem is being addressed.

49
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,159
The rich countries have already pledged and promised

50
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,640
$100 billion a year, starting from 2020 to cover

51
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,960
all kinds of climate change activities,

52
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,240
which in climate change jargon we call either mitigation or adaptation.

53
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,400
Oh, yeah. I mean, that's an enormous amount of money.

54
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,680
Not that enormous compared to what they gave to the banking system when it

55
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,840
collapsed. Climate change is a much bigger problem

56
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,599
than the banking crisis.

57
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,479
Salim al-Huk interviewed on the BBC World Service Programme

58
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,719
NewsHour Extra. Well, he says rich countries have pledged,

59
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,400
or promised, to deliver $100 billion a year

60
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,359
to help poorer countries adapt to climate change.

61
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:04,879
However, he suggests that this sum could have been larger,

62
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,639
since more money than this was donated to resolve the banking crisis.

63
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,120
For example, after the devastating effects of hurricane Sandy,

64
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,400
New York City invested $10 billion on storm defenses to protect Manhattan

65
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,520
and Wall Street. And where lack of water is a problem,

66
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,640
countries like Australia, China and Spain have built desalination plants,

67
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,400
which remove the salt from sea water to produce drinking water.

68
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,599
But it's too expensive for developing countries to do this,

69
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,360
even though they need them.

70
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,360
So, in relative terms, $1 billion a year to help poor countries

71
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,319
is a small sum of money when compared to their need.

72
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,000
Countries like Bangladesh have developed homegrown technologies,

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,400
which means produced locally, such as harvesting rainwater from their rooftops.

74
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,120
Okay, Alice, and thinking about certain radical proposals for adaptation,

75
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,639
did you know there's a Dutch company that wants to build floating cities for us to live in?

76
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,120
No, I didn't. Yeah. Plans include 15-story high-rise buildings

77
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,879
and floating food production.

78
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,400
Hmm, it sounds like it would be incredibly expensive.

79
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,000
Has anyone actually built one?

80
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,280
No, not so far. Let's hear from Mark Maslin,

81
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,639
Professor of Climateology at University College London,

82
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,319
talking about why this might be.

83
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,160
Remember, we're going to have 9.5 billion people

84
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,920
by the middle of this century.

85
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,279
Now, if you think about it, think about the logistics of building

86
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,560
a city floating for, say, 10 million people,

87
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,759
and then multiply that up to 60% of 9.5 billion people.

88
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,319
Okay, so don't think it's really cost-efficient.

89
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:47,680
So, in practical terms, the logistics of building a large floating city

90
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,039
probably wouldn't work. It wouldn't be cost-efficient or good value for the money you paid.

91
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:57,039
And logistics means the organisation of a complex activity.

92
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:01,599
On the other hand, the logistics of teaching farmers in Bangladesh to breed ducks,

93
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:06,159
instead of chickens, for example, would be relatively simple and cost-efficient.

94
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,640
And since ducks float and chickens don't,

95
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,120
it's a sensible adaptation to climate change.

96
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,640
That's a great example, Neil.

97
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,160
Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question.

98
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,280
I asked how much has the average temperature of the Earth's surface increased

99
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,560
in the last 100 years? Is it A, 0.85 degrees Celsius?

100
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,360
B, 1.85 degrees Celsius?

101
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,120
Or C, 8.5 degrees Celsius?

102
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,639
And I said 8.5 degrees Celsius and I know I'm wrong.

103
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,360
Yes, I'm afraid you are, Neil.

104
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,519
The right answer is actually 0.85 degrees Celsius.

105
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:49,519
And did you know that 13 of the 14 warmest years were recorded in the 21st century?

106
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,519
I did not know that, Alice, but I do know which words we learned today.

107
00:05:53,519 --> 00:06:00,319
They are unseasonably mitigate pledged desalination,

108
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,839
homegrown, cost-efficient, logistics.

109
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,199
And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

110
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,040
Don't forget to join us again soon.

111
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,839
Bye. Bye-bye.
