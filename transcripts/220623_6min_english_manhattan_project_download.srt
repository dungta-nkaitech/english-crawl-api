Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Sam.

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:27,519
And hello, I'm Rob. On August the 6th, 1945, the US Aircraft Enola Gay dropped an atomic bomb

4
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:34,320
on the city of Hiroshima, instantly killing 70,000 people. When Japan refused to surrender,

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,480
a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki three days later. Many believe the bombings quickened

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,560
the end of the Second World War, but it came as a terrible human cost, which some have called a

7
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,159
crime against humanity. The invention of the atomic bomb, which resulted from the cooperation

8
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:58,239
between the US military and some of the world's leading scientific minds was known as the Manhattan

9
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,199
Project. In this programme, we'll take a look into the science and the politics of the Manhattan

10
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,519
Project, and as usual, we'll learn some new vocabulary as well. Even before World War 2,

11
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:16,079
scientists had known about the potential energy inside uranium, the heaviest metal in the periodic

12
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:22,239
table, a diagram which groups the chemical elements into rows and columns according to their

13
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:29,359
atomic number and symbol. The challenge for science was learning how to unleash this potential energy

14
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,719
in a controlled way. We'll hear more soon, but first I have a question for you, Rob.

15
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:41,599
I mentioned that uranium is the heaviest element in the periodic table, but which is the lightest?

16
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:54,000
Is it a hydrogen, b carbon or c oxygen? Well oxygen is a gas, so it must be pretty light, so I'll say c

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,119
oxygen. Okay, Rob will find out the answer later in the programme. First, let's find out a bit more

18
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:07,519
about the science of uranium from Frank Close, an Oxford professor of theoretical physics

19
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:16,079
in conversation with BBC Radio 4 programme in our time. Well in 1938, the discovery was made

20
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:23,599
that if you use uranium, the atoms of uranium, the other heaviest that occur naturally in the

21
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:29,599
periodic table, they're very fragile, and the discovery was that if you just almost touch them

22
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:36,479
with a single neutron, that's a nuclear particle, the uranium was like a drop of water, it would just

23
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:42,879
break apart, split into, and this action of splitting the uranium has become known as fission.

24
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:52,000
Atoms of uranium are very fragile, easily broken or damaged. In 1938, it was discovered

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,879
that when nuclear particles called neutrons were fired at uranium atoms, they would split or break

26
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:06,319
into. This process of splitting uranium or fission did two things. First, it released huge

27
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,599
amounts of energy a billion times more than would be released in a normal chemical reaction.

28
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:18,079
Secondly, the act of splitting atoms released two more neutrons. These new neutrons were freed

29
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:23,519
to hit more uranium, creating four neutrons which in turn were freed in created eight,

30
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,240
then sixteen and so on, making what's known as a chemical chain reaction.

31
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:34,879
In everyday English, a chain reaction is a series of events where each event becomes the

32
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:41,359
cause of the next. The politics behind the development of the atomic bomb was no less complex

33
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:47,519
than the science. In the same year that Hitler invaded Poland, two Jewish scientists exiled from

34
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,800
Nazi Germany, Rudolf PRLs and Otto Frisch, first realized uranium's power as a weapon of war.

35
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,199
Listen as Professor Frank Kloss takes up the story for BBC Radio 4 program in our time.

36
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,679
Now, what happened at that moment was that having had the idea and the shock of the discovery,

37
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:13,679
you immediately then think maybe scientists in Germany have already had the same idea and come

38
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:19,680
to the same conclusions, could Hitler already be building such a weapon. In the Memorandum,

39
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,159
which they wrote and reached the British government, they said it's conceivable that Germany is in

40
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:29,680
fact developing this weapon and the only defence against it is to have one yourself.

41
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,319
After their discovery, PRLs and Frisch were worried that the Nazis had already found out

42
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:43,680
how to weaponize uranium. It was conceivable or believable that Germany was building an atomic bomb.

43
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,399
They shared this terrifying thought in their famous Memorandum, a short written report on a specific

44
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:56,720
topic. As soon as US President Franklin Roosevelt read it, he started the Manhattan project and

45
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,720
the race to build an atomic bomb began. In a strange twist of history, it turned out that Hitler

46
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,920
hadn't been building atomic bombs at all, and Hiroshima, the Japanese city destroyed in 1945,

47
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:17,280
was rebuilt and stands as a symbol of peace today. Okay, let's end on a lighter note, Sam, with your

48
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,240
question. Yes, I asked which is the lightest element in the periodic table? It's A, hydrogen,

49
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,480
the lightest of all gases which come at the very start of the periodic table, having the atomic

50
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,879
number one. Ah, if only I'd remembered what our chemistry teacher taught us about the periodic table.

51
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,600
That's a chart grouping all the chemical elements according to their atomic number.

52
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,680
Let's recap the rest of the vocabulary too. If something is fragile, it's easily broken.

53
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,000
To split something means to break it into two parts. A chain reaction happens when one event

54
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,079
becomes the cause of the next. A memorandum is a short, written report on a specific topic.

55
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:06,319
And finally, the adjective conceivable means believable. And that brings us to the end of our

56
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,839
programme. We hope you'll join us again soon for more interesting issues and useful vocabulary.

57
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,199
Bye for now. Goodbye.
