00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,839
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,519
And I'm Neil. So, Alice, what's your ideal place to be?

6
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,920
Oh, curled up on the sofa with a good book in front of a log fire.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,920
Last night it was very cold.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,760
Well, for me, lying in a hammock under a palm tree on a tropical beach,

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,960
with a cool breeze. I don't like it when it's too hot.

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,200
Hmm, yes, true. Humans don't cope well with extremes of temperature,

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,800
but some species do. The subject of today's show is extremophiles.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,880
These are microorganisms that have adapted to live in what we would consider to be extreme conditions.

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,400
For example, living in near-boiling acidic water, or frozen at the bottom of an Antarctic lake.

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,439
Hmm, those do sound like pretty extreme conditions.

15
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:02,239
Yes, the thing is, what sounds hostile, or unfriendly to us,

16
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,799
are perfect environments for extremophiles,

17
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,679
and in fact, they wouldn't survive without them.

18
00:01:07,679 --> 00:01:11,679
Now, are you tough enough to face up to today's quiz question, Neil?

19
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:12,719
Oh, I think so.

20
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,319
All right, then here goes.

21
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,000
Which US National Park is home to geeseers,

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,599
or hot springs that shoot hot water and steam into the air,

23
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:23,759
which have extremophiles living in them?

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,160
Is it a Grand Canyon,

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,800
b Death Valley National Park, or c Yellowstone?

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,600
Oh, that's easy. It has to be c Yellowstone.

27
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,800
Okay, well, we'll find out if you got the answer right later on in the show.

28
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,640
But moving on now, Neil,

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,439
did you know that extremophiles belong to an entirely different group of living things

30
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,200
to other animals and plants?

31
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,320
No, I imagined extremophiles would be like insects,

32
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,400
because insects are pretty tough, aren't they?

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,760
Yes, that's true.

34
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,040
But remember, extremophiles are microorganisms.

35
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,640
They're really tiny.

36
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
Let's listen to Ian Crawford,

37
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,880
professor of planetary science and astrobiology at Birkbeck University of London.

38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,159
He tells us how in the 1970s, a scientist called Carl Wurzer

39
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,480
identified a new kingdom of living things that he called archaea,

40
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,159
meaning ancient ones.

41
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,159
The extremophiles belong to this group.

42
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,240
Well, the old tree of life idea basically talked about empires,

43
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,639
if you like, of plants and animals.

44
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,639
And the things that we can see essentially,

45
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,519
we put a great deal of emphasis on large organisms

46
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,039
and the traditional distinction in biology between botany and zoology.

47
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:37,840
What it really did was say, that's all wrong.

48
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,400
There's really only three major groups in life.

49
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,560
There's the archaea, the bacteria,

50
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,800
and the eukaryotes, which is all of this complex life.

51
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,280
And so it kind of put humans into a small corner of the tree of life

52
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,040
mixed to plants and whatever else.

53
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,320
It kind of squashes us again out of being the center of the universe.

54
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,480
So botany is the study of plant life and zoology is the study of animal life.

55
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,000
But maybe you can explain archaea and eukaryotes, Alice.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,320
archaea are a group of single-celled microbes similar to bacteria,

57
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,320
but different to all other known types.

58
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:17,280
Eukaryote is the scientific term for organisms with a much larger or more complex type of cell.

59
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,239
And this group includes all animals, plants, and fungi.

60
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,759
But why are archaea so important?

61
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:26,560
Why do they need a whole biological domain to themselves?

62
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,159
Are we humans, gets squashed up in one domain with plants and fungi?

63
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,159
Well, Neil, it's likely they've been living on our planet ever since the Earth became habitable,

64
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,840
and that's billions of years.

65
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,280
And they are still living and thriving in a whole range of different environments today.

66
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,240
And when something is thriving, it means it's doing well.

67
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,480
So tell us about where they live, Alice.

68
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:54,159
Some live in hydrothermal vents, holes in the ocean floor, hundreds of meters down,

69
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,560
where there's lots of pressure and no sunlight.

70
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,360
And mineral-rich superheated water is coming out of the Earth's crust,

71
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,120
and then flowing out through these holes.

72
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,319
I see. Well, what about cold-loving extramophiles?

73
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,000
Well, scientists have found them in hidden lakes trapped beneath ice sheets hundreds of meters thick

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,399
in Antarctica. It takes days to drill through the ice to reach the water.

75
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,480
And how do they survive down there?

76
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:24,159
Well, these microbes have found a way of getting energy from certain minerals like iron and sulfur,

77
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:25,360
present in the water.

78
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,600
Hmm, that sounds clever from microbes.

79
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,120
How do they figure that out?

80
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,800
It isn't a question of cleverness, it's a question of adaptation.

81
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,639
Extramophiles are extremely well adapted to their environment,

82
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,400
and they appeared on Earth much earlier than more complex life forms.

83
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,439
Let's hear from Nick Lane, reader in Evolutionary Biochemistry at University College London.

84
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,240
The origin of the eukaryotic cello, say it seems to have happened once,

85
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,040
it took about two billion years before that happened.

86
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,240
Then there was a kind of great leap forward at the cellular level,

87
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,280
but another billion years went by before we see animals.

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,399
So basically, the animal kingdom is much newer than the archaeian kingdom.

89
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,279
Indeed. And now it's time for the answer to today's quiz question, Neil.

90
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:15,279
I asked, which US National Park is home to geese that have extramophiles living in them?

91
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:21,279
Is it a, Grand Canyon, B, Death Valley National Park, or C, Yellowstone?

92
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,239
And I said C, Yellowstone, I must be right.

93
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:28,399
Yes, Neil, you are right. It's Yellowstone National Park.

94
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,759
Every year, scientists discover remarkable new microbes in Yellowstone's hot springs,

95
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,439
with implications for medicine, agriculture and energy,

96
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,279
as well as offering clues to the formation of the earliest life on Earth.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,519
Very interesting. Now, here are the words we heard today.

98
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:57,679
Extramophiles, hostile, geezers, microorganisms, botany, zoology, archaea,

99
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:03,679
eukaryote, thriving, hydrothermal vents.

100
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:06,079
And that's the end of today's Sixth and It English.

101
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,319
Don't forget to join us again soon. Bye.

102
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:08,719
Bye.
