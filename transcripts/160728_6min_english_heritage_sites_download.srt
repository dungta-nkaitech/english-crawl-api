00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:14,560
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,679
And I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,879
So Neil, what's the best holiday you've ever had?

7
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:24,240
Oh, that would be scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef of the coast of Australia.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,080
Oh, it was awesome. I saw sharks, sea turtles,

9
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,919
manta rays. I certainly don't like the idea of coming nose to nose with a shark.

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,679
But then diving isn't really my thing. I'm more into cultural holidays, you know,

11
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,399
visiting the ruins of ancient civilizations.

12
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,759
Hmm, that's very worthy, Alice. But tourists are actually damaging a number of important sites

13
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,719
around the world, tramping around, dropping litter, scribbling graffiti everywhere.

14
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,200
I would never drop litter or scribble graffiti.

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,320
Well, we're talking about world heritage sites today,

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,320
which our place's UNESCO considers to be at risk from various threats and in need of protection.

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,239
Heritage means the things a society considers important to its history and culture,

18
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:13,599
for example, art, buildings or natural sites, such as the Grand Canyon in the United States.

19
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,519
Hmm, and the environment poses a number of different threats.

20
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:24,159
So Neil, can you tell me which sea creature is a potential threat to the Great Barrier Reef's ecosystem?

21
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:31,599
Is it a starfish, b, jellyfish or sea, cuttlefish?

22
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:39,519
Hmm, I will go for b, jellyfish. I'm no expert on marine life, but I have eaten jellyfish

23
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:40,879
and I haven't eaten the other ones.

24
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,039
I see. Well, we'll find out later on if you're an expert or not.

25
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:50,159
But let's listen now to BBC reporter Roger Haravan talking about other types of threat

26
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:52,879
to heritage sites. See how many you can spot.

27
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,759
The most precious wonders of the natural world.

28
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,079
Australia's Great Barrier Reef.

29
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,599
America's spectacular Grand Canyon.

30
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,159
The Barrier Reef of Belize in South America, second biggest on earth.

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,280
All facing threats from humans.

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,159
The Great Barrier Reef is attracting urgent concern.

33
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,319
There's a huge battle over mining and port development.

34
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,799
A giant coal mine has just been given the go ahead by the Queensland Government.

35
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:25,599
Even though scientists warn it may damage the reef.

36
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,959
That's the BBC's Roger Haravan.

37
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,479
Well, I spotted a couple of threats to heritage sites there.

38
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,400
Mining and port development.

39
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:40,400
Now, any type of industrial activity can harm them by, for example, encroaching on the natural

40
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,079
habitat of animals and plants living there or by polluting the water that flows into the site.

41
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,840
Mining is the process of extracting coal or other minerals from the ground.

42
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,400
And if you encroach on something, it means you move beyond acceptable limits.

43
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:03,200
The interesting thing is that world heritage sites only constitute 0.5% of the earth's surface.

44
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,360
So why can't people do their mining and industrial development on the remaining 99.5%.

45
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,480
But there's one human industry that can actually be beneficial for precious sites.

46
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,439
Tourism.

47
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,520
But you said earlier that tourism was bad for heritage sites.

48
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,400
I know.

49
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,479
And I was right up to a point.

50
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,479
World heritage sites are some of tourism's main attractions,

51
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,120
and more and more people are visiting them.

52
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,079
So it's all about getting the balance right between generating money to maintain and restore

53
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,919
the sites and minimising the impact of tourist activities.

54
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,079
Hmm, such as littering and graffiti.

55
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,039
Exactly.

56
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,840
And the term for this is sustainable tourism.

57
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,719
Or tourism design to have a low impact on the local culture and the environment

58
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,960
while generating employment for local people.

59
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,840
So UNESCO is working to direct government site managers and visitors

60
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,120
towards sustainable tourism practices in order to keep our world's natural and cultural heritage

61
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,719
safe for future generations.

62
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,960
Wow, you can really talk the talk, Alice.

63
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,319
You should work for UNESCO.

64
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,319
Okay, let's move on now and listen to Paul Crocombe of the snorkeling and diving company

65
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,079
in Townsville, Queensland, Australia, giving his view on how the great barrier reef will cope

66
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,759
with threats to its survival.

67
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,159
The reach is fairly dynamic.

68
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:24,800
It's been through a couple of ice ages and still here.

69
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,079
So its resilience will ensure that the reef is still here in years to come.

70
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,800
But the species diversity and the visual aesthetics of reef may change quite considerably,

71
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,240
especially if you get an increase in sea temperature and increase in carbon dioxide

72
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,680
and the water and things like that.

73
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,000
Paul Crocombe describes the reef as dynamic and resilient.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,759
Dynamic means active or capable of changing, and resilience means the ability to recover

75
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,160
or adapt to change, which all sounds good.

76
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,920
But Paul also says that the species diversity, the range of plants and animals, may change.

77
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,840
Hmm, for example, a rise in sea temperature would cause a rise in carbon dioxide levels,

78
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,439
and this could have a big impact on both the species diversity and the reef's visual aesthetic.

79
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,199
Or the way it looks.

80
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,879
Okay, I think it's time now for the answer to today's quiz question, Alice.

81
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,480
Yes, I think so too.

82
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:25,280
Okay, so I asked you which sea creature poses a potential threat to the Great Barrier Reef's ecosystem?

83
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,560
Is it a type of a starfish, b jellyfish or c couplefish?

84
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,560
And I said b jellyfish.

85
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,960
And you've got stung number-fraid neal.

86
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,160
Ow!

87
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,040
The answer is starfish.

88
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:47,280
The crown of thorns starfish, praise on coral and large outbreaks of these starfish can devastate reefs.

89
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,200
Now, can you remind us of some of today's vocabulary neal?

90
00:05:51,200 --> 00:06:01,600
Sure. Heritage encroach on something, sustainable tourism, dynamic, resilience, species diversity,

91
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,520
visual aesthetic.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,240
Well, that's the end of today's six-minute English.

93
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,759
Don't forget to join us again soon.

94
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:08,879
Bye.

95
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,360
Goodbye.
