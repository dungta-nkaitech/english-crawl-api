00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,040
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Sophie.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,600
And I'm Neil. Did you watch the Tour de France cycling race this summer Sophie?

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,920
No, I didn't. I'm not a cycling enthusiast, Neil, unlike you.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,879
I was pretty exciting stuff. In fact, just thinking about it

9
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,239
makes me want to jump on my bike and ride off right now.

10
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,479
Don't go just yet because today's show is all about bicycles

11
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:42,960
and I've got a question for you. Who invented the first pneumatic or air-filled cycle tire in 1888?

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,480
Was it A John Boy Dunlop, B Charles Goodyear or C Harvey Samuel Firestone?

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,039
Well, I'm going to go for A John Boy Dunlop. Can I go now?

14
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,719
No, you can't. We'll find out later on in the show if you got the tire question right or not.

15
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,519
But first, I'd like you to tell us a bit about the history of the bike.

16
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,120
If you insist, well, before the modern bike was invented in 1885, people rode

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,879
bone shakers, high wheelers and even tricycles.

18
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,680
A tricycle is a three-wheeler bike that young children ride before they learn to balance

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,120
on a two-wheeler. But what's a bone shaker, Neil?

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,200
It was the first bike with pedals called a Velocipede by its manufacturers.

21
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,680
Others called it a bone shaker because its tires were made of iron,

22
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,000
so it was very uncomfortable to ride, especially over cobblestone streets.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,439
It sounds awful. Now moving on, the bicycle started out as an expensive toy for the middle classes.

24
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,400
But when manufacturing costs dropped, they became a vehicle for social change.

25
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,520
By the late 19th century, bikes had become affordable for a large proportion of the population

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,640
and the technology had moved on, so they weren't so dangerous, also uncomfortable to ride.

27
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,000
And for the first time in history, people had the freedom to travel where they wanted,

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,400
when they wanted, including women. Let's hear more about women in cycling from Robert Penn,

29
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,879
UK author and lifelong cyclist.

30
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:19,439
In very practical terms, it had a very significant effect on what women wore in public.

31
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:25,519
And when they first rode bicycles, they were expected to ride in long ankle length skirts and

32
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,079
voluminous petticoats. And of course, that was entirely impractical. So they adopted what was

33
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:37,120
called rational dress. And rational dress was a better fitting jacket and pantaloon trousers,

34
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,199
which are cinched below their knee, which meant that nothing got caught in the chain.

35
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:48,239
And at first, there was massive public outrage. There were core cases about whether or not

36
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,599
women were allowed to be served in pubs wearing this sort of dress.

37
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,199
So women in the 19th century typically wore long skirts and voluminous or large petticoats.

38
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:04,879
A petticoat is a piece of clothing worn under a dress or skirt. But what does rational dress

39
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:12,000
mean exactly, Sophie? Rational here means logical. It wasn't logical to wear ankle length skirts

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,599
with voluminous petticoats on a bike. So women started wearing pantaloon trousers.

41
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,400
Pantaloon trousers were baggy, though they were cinched or gathered in below the knee,

42
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,000
so they wouldn't catch in the bicycle chain. But pantaloons for women still caused outrage

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,400
or shock and anger. Because although they were baggy, they were still trousers. And they didn't

44
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:41,439
go down to the ankle. So bikes played a part in women's struggle for emancipation or freedom.

45
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:47,599
But let's listen now to Robert Penn, who claims that it also played a role in our evolutionary history.

46
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:56,000
It's definitely sure that the gene pool in countries like Britain, because it meant that people

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
could go further than they ever had before in order to find a partner for life and to mate.

48
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,479
And so what started as a really fadish leisure pursuit within a decade of 1885,

49
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,360
the bicycle became the most popular form of transport on the planet, and it has been ever since.

50
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:22,480
What does shore up mean, Sophie? It means support. And gene pool here refers to the collection of

51
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:29,199
genes in a particular population. So when people travelled further to marry and have children,

52
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,959
they were making the gene pool bigger and healthier. And Robert Penn uses the word fadish. He says

53
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:41,759
cycling started as a fadish thing. A fad or fadish activity means an enthusiasm for something that

54
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:48,319
doesn't last very long. But your enthusiasm for cycling is not a fad. No, it isn't. Do you think

55
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,039
like-rowaring is a fad and we'll all go back to wearing pantaloons in the future, Sophie? No?

56
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,800
Not a good look. Okay, maybe it's time for the answer to today's quiz question.

57
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:08,399
I asked, who invented the first cycle tire in 1888? Was it A, John Boyd Dunlop? B, Charles Goodier,

58
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:16,000
or C, Harvey Samuel Firestone? And I said John Boyd Dunlop, tell me I'm right. You are right.

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,439
Well done, Neil. Scottish inventor and veterinary surgeon John Boyd Dunlop developed the pneumatic

60
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:29,839
rubber tire. Although it was invented as an improvement on the bicycle, the pneumatic tire arrived on

61
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:36,399
the scene just in time to contribute to the success of the car. Now here are the words we heard

62
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:46,959
today. They are pneumatic, voluminous, petticoat, rational, pantaloon, cinched, outraged,

63
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:57,120
emancipation, shore up, gene pool, fad or fadish. Well that's the end of today's six-minute
