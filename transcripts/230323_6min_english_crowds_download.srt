00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hello, this is 6Nate English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And I'm Neil.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
There was a huge crowd of people waiting at the train station this morning, Neil.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
When the train finally arrived, everyone rushed in and I couldn't find a seat.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I hate crowds.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But you love going to the football match on Saturday.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Ah, well that's different. More like a big group of friends.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, whether it's sporting events, train stations or political protests,

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
crowds, that's large groups of people who gather together for a shared activity,

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
are a feature of life.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
For some, crowds create feelings of excitement and a sense of community,

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
while for others, they feel uncomfortable, confusing or even dangerous.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So why is that?

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
In this programme we'll be discussing the role of crowds in modern life,

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
asking why they evoke different reactions in people.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And as usual, we'll be learning some new vocabulary as well.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But first, I have a question for you, Neil.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The biggest crowd in history happened in 2019,

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
when over 200 million people gathered in the Northern Indian City of Alahabad.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But what did so many people come together for?

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Was it a, a cricket match, be a religious festival or see an election?

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, I know Indians love cricket, but I doubt 200 million people would fit into a stadium,

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
so I'll guess it's see an election.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay, Neil. We'll find out the answer later in the programme.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
People gathering for a cricket match or a music concert are usually happy events.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But crowds can have a darker side as well.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
They can become out of control and sometimes even violent.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Here's psychologist Professor John Jury discussing this idea

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
with an Andagasia presenter of the BBC World Service programme,

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
appropriately named Crowd Science.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
When people get together in a crowd, they regress psychologically.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Their thinking is more primitive, they become more gullible.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And that's also associated with a supposed tendency towards violence as well.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But according to John, the idea of mob mentality that people in crowds are irrational

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and prone to destructive behaviour just isn't backed up by research.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
One view is that when people get together in a crowd, they become irrational.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Psychologically speaking, they regress.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
They return to a less advanced, more primitive way of behaving.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
They may also become more gullible.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
An adjective meaning easily tricked or willing to believe everything someone says.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Connected to this is the phrase mob mentality,

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
the tendency of people in a group to behave in the same way as others in the group,

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
rather than as individuals.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
In crowds, people may do things they would never do alone,

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
like steel or use violence.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But according to Professor Drury in reality, it's not mob mentality and violence,

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
but rather feelings of safety and togetherness that actually characterise crowds.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And according to Dr Anne Templeton, another expert on crowd psychology from the University of Edinburgh,

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
that's especially true when you identify with the other people in a crowd.

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Here's Dr Templeton explaining more to BBC World Service Programme Crowd Science.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The more people feel like they are a part of a group with others in the crowd,

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
the more enjoyable experience they have.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
There's a correlation between having that social identification and feeling safer.

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So often if we feel like we are in a group with others, we expect them to look after us.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The flip side of that is when you don't feel as much part of the group

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and you're not having this positive experience.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Dr Templeton thinks there is a correlation.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's a connection or a link between being among people who share your values and feeling safe.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Football fans cheer their team on by wearing the same colours and singing the same songs,

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and this works as a kind of glue bonding the crowd together and making them feel safe.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The disadvantage of this, however, is when you don't feel part of the crowd you're with.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Dr Templeton calls this the flip side, the opposite, less good or less pleasant aspect of something.

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
In today's world, crowds are important because of the feeling of power they give us.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's one thing sitting alone, shouting at the news on television,

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
but it's something else altogether to march on a political protest with hundreds of demonstrators,

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
feeling that together you could change the world.

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Maybe that's what everyone was doing in 2019, Sam.

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Right, in my question I asked you why 200 million people gathered in the Indian City of Alahabad in 2019.

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I guess it was to vote in an election. Was I right?

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You were wrong, I'm afraid Neil.

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
In fact, the biggest crowd in history had gathered for a Hindu religious festival,

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,000
the Kambh Mehla, which 220 million people attended over 50 days.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this programme on crowds.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Large numbers of people who gather together for a shared reason.

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
To regress means return to less advance, more primitive behaviours.

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Regress is the opposite of progress.

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Someone who is gullible is easily tricked and will believe anything people say.

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The phrase mob mentality describes the tendency of people in a group to behave in ways that conform with others in the group

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
rather than as individuals.

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
A correlation is a connection or a link between two things.

83
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And finally, the flip side of something means those aspects of it which are less obvious, good or pleasant.

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The flip side of this programme is that once again our six minutes are up.

85
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Bye for now.

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Bye-bye.
