From BBC Learning English

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,399
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Rob.

6
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,480
And hello, I'm Neil and Rob.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,039
I have to say I am very, very excited.

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,519
Oh, why is that Neil? Are you going on holiday?

9
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,679
Oh, come on, Rob. You know why?

10
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,000
The 2018 World Cup is about to start in Russia,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,560
four weeks of world-class football to watch.

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,000
By world-class, I mean some of the best in the world.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Oh, yes, yes. I know that.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,760
But to be honest, I'll just be taking a passing interest.

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,280
I've got better things to do.

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,719
Better things to do.

17
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,840
Well, I'm going to be glued to my TV

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,799
to watch the 32 countries compete for the title of World Cup Champions.

19
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,039
And if you love football or not,

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,359
we've got some useful vocabulary to learn.

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,559
But let's start with a question for you to answer, Neil,

22
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,799
to see how much you really know.

23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,159
Now, the mascot for Russia 2018 is a wolf called Zabivarka.

24
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,479
What does his name mean in English?

25
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,799
Is it A. The winner?

26
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,239
B. The one who scores or C. Fair Play?

27
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,359
Uh, well, my Russian is a little rusty,

28
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:23,679
so I'll go for A. The winner.

29
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,240
OK, I'll reveal the answer later.

30
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,880
OK, but now I have a question for you, Rob.

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,080
Who won the last World Cup in Brazil in 2014?

32
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,080
Oh, come on. It was Germany, Neil,

33
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,600
and they beat Lionel Messi's Argentina in the final.

34
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,160
Both teams are among the favourites again this time,

35
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,120
but there'll be lots of countries who fancy their chances

36
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,200
of lifting the World Cup trophy.

37
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,840
That means they think they're likely to succeed,

38
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,440
even though they might not.

39
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,760
So you do know your football, Rob.

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,719
Anyway, the final will take place in the revamped

41
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,719
or much improved Luzniki Stadium in Moscow on July 15th, 2018.

42
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,640
Did I say I was very excited?

43
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,040
Well, I'm not the only one.

44
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,159
We are some people what they think about the World Cup

45
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,439
and hear a Keith and Jane describing their feelings.

46
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,680
It's a four-week festival of football, isn't it?

47
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,000
Everyone kind of gets behind their country.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,800
You also get to know about football teams in parts of the world.

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,280
You don't really think about very often.

50
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,039
So it's that double-sided thing of the actual football itself,

51
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,719
which is exciting, but also the stories that happen off the pitch as well.

52
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm really excited. I can't wait for it to start.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,639
One thing, there's going to be great telly every night.

54
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,759
It's great to see the underdogs that are going to come through

55
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,840
and have a really sensational tournament.

56
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,199
I think it's the enthusiasm of the crowds

57
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,840
and the love of football that people have.

58
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,039
So two football fans there.

59
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,120
Keith used some good alliteration.

60
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,519
That's words beginning with the same letter.

61
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,759
Four-week festival of fun.

62
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,199
He talked about people getting behind their country,

63
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,879
not literally going behind their team, but supporting them.

64
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,399
Who are you supporting, Rob?

65
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:08,560
Well, my home team is England,

66
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,639
but I'm not confident they'll do well.

67
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,319
That doesn't matter to Jane, though.

68
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,280
She said it's fun to see the underdogs do well.

69
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,719
The underdog here means the team considered to be the weakest

70
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,399
and the least likely to win.

71
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,280
You could say Iceland are the underdogs in this tournament.

72
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,319
Maybe, Rob.

73
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,280
So you can see where everyone's excited by the World Cup.

74
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,319
Not everyone, Neil.

75
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,280
For many people, they're not bothered by the tournament.

76
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,680
We could say it's not their thing.

77
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,599
And there are different reasons for it.

78
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,120
Let's hear from some other people, Jeff and Inga.

79
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,520
There's not a lot of sportsmanship in it now.

80
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,240
I find that it's very corporate.

81
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,680
There's a lot of what I would call cheating going on.

82
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,120
People taking dives.

83
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
People falling over because somebody looked at them

84
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,800
the wrong way on the pitch.

85
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,080
Not really that excited.

86
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,280
It's just too much hype about nothing, really.

87
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,840
The World Cup is a great event if you are into football,

88
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,240
but I'm not so can't be really bored.

89
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,000
Well, there you go, Neil.

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,680
Some sensible people there.

91
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,000
Jeff thinks football has changed

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,400
and now lacks real sportsmanship.

93
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,560
That's fair and honest behaviour.

94
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,879
He even claims some players cheat.

95
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,240
I'm not sure about that, Rob, but maybe he's right

96
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,719
about the tournament becoming very corporate,

97
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:25,199
which means it's sponsored by big companies

98
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,079
who like to decide how the tournament's run.

99
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,719
And Inga thinks there's too much hype.

100
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:33,199
This means there's a lot of talk and publicity

101
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,360
to make people interested in something.

102
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,839
Well, there is certainly a lot of talk about the World Cup,

103
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,199
but we have to remember it's not everybody's cup of tea.

104
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,199
Well, it is my cup of tea, Rob.

105
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,600
Now, can we have the answer to that question, please?

106
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,439
Yes, earlier I said the mascot for Russia 2018,

107
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,000
it's a wolf called Zabivarka.

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,400
What does his name mean in English?

109
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,240
Was it A, the winner?

110
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,120
B, the one who scores or C, fair play?

111
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,879
And I said A, the winner, because football's all about winning, isn't it?

112
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,040
It's the taking part that's important, Neil,

113
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,560
and you took part in my quiz and got it wrong.

114
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,680
The answer is B, the one who scores.

115
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,520
Now, let's have a brief reminder

116
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,680
of the vocabulary we've discussed today,

117
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,519
starting with world class.

118
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:20,000
That means some of the best in the world.

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,799
We should see some world class football in Russia.

120
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:24,319
If we're watching it, Neil.

121
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,719
Next, we had fancy their chances.

122
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:28,719
If someone fancies their chances,

123
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:31,519
they think they're likely to succeed, but they might not.

124
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,759
Let's move on to get behind.

125
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,079
If we get behind someone, like our national football team, we support them.

126
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,399
Are you getting behind our national team, Neil?

127
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,439
No, I'm supporting the underdog, Iceland, Rob.

128
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,800
That's a word to describe the team or person least likely to win.

129
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,519
Next, we discussed sportsmanship.

130
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,319
That describes fair and honest behaviour.

131
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,560
And finally, we talked about hype,

132
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,040
which means lots of talking and publicity

133
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,720
to make people interested in something.

134
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,639
Well, we've had enough hype about the world cup today and we're out of time.

135
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,120
