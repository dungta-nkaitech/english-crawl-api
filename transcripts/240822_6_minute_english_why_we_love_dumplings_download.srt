2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,080
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,599
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,920
In China, they're crescent-shaped and filled with pork and cabbage.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,400
In Nepal, they're called momoes and are fried with buffalo meat.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,679
In Ireland, they're soaked in Guinness gravy and Italians fill them with spinach

7
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,760
and call them nyokki.

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,600
They can be steamed or fried and are found all over the world.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,400
I'm talking, of course, about dumplings.

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,359
Dumplings are a group of dishes where a filling is wrapped inside pieces of cooked dough.

11
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,719
They're basically dough envelopes with a filling inside.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,799
Fillings can be anything from meat and fish to vegetables, tofu or cheese.

13
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:58,960
And the dough is usually based on a starchy grain like wheat, rice, corn or potato.

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,679
In fact, the English word dumpling comes from a 17th century adjective,

15
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:05,599
dump, meaning dough-like.

16
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,799
The really amazing thing about dumplings is that they're found all over the world.

17
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,240
Over the centuries, different countries and regions have experimented with

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,040
flavours and fillings to create something unique.

19
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,159
Wherever in the world you are, there's probably a special kind of dumpling for you.

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,240
In this programme, we'll be sampling a dumpling from the West African

21
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,920
country of Ghana.

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,399
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

23
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:35,119
Great, but first I have a question for you, Beth.

24
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:38,719
Probably the most famous British dumplings,

25
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:44,319
suet dumplings are cooked on top of a chicken or beef stew that made from suet.

26
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,079
But what exactly is that?

27
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,119
Is suet a wheat, b potato or sea animal fat?

28
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,760
I think suet is made from animal fats.

29
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,320
Okay, Beth, we'll find out if that's the correct answer later in the programme.

30
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,680
The origins of dumplings are a mystery.

31
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,360
Historians think the dish is very old, but no one knows for sure when or where the first

32
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,719
dumpling was cooked. One theory puts the birthplace of the dumpling along the silk road,

33
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,280
linking China with Central Asia and Turkey.

34
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:25,680
One way or another, the dumpling journeyed through the Middle East and across Africa to Ghana,

35
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,759
where today it's a favourite way of adding carbohydrates to a dish,

36
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,240
as well as soaking up sources and juices.

37
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,639
Caprui Agdhda is a business woman and fan of the Ghanaian dumpling called Kenki.

38
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,560
Here she introduces Kenki to Ruth Alexander,

39
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,000
presenter of the BBC World Service programme The Food Chain.

40
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,280
I love Kenki. In fact, I had Kenki this afternoon.

41
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,639
You've had some this afternoon?

42
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,879
Yes, I love it. And it hits the spot.

43
00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:00,800
Absolutely. And the Ga'wa, the Ga'wa is one of the tribes in Ghana.

44
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,680
And Kenki is the ass-taple food, even though it's eaten across the whole country.

45
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,080
How is it then eaten?

46
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,599
Now, we have to eat Kenki with what we call chitok, chili sauce, okay?

47
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,879
But we also have the black sauce, which streams fish and all sort of proteins in it.

48
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,879
And then, yum yum, you go at it. You dig in.

49
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,280
So is this really satisfying comfort food?

50
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,000
It is very satisfying. In fact, Kenki is loved by most people who do manual works,

51
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:42,799
because it feels that Tommy and he takes you almost a whole day before you feel hungry again.

52
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,000
Caféu says eating Kenki really hits the spot.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,439
If something hits the spot, it's exactly what you wanted and totally satisfies you.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,560
Kenki dumplings are made from maize sourdough and eaten across Ghana.

55
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,319
For some tribes, Kenki is their staple food, a basic and important type of food that is

56
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,280
regularly eaten by a large portion of the population.

57
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,919
In Britain, for example, bread and eggs are staple foods.

58
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,279
Kenki takes time to make. The maize needs to be soaked in water for a week,

59
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,959
but when they're ready and served with a hot chili sauce,

60
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:29,199
Caféu uses two phrases to show it's time to eat. Yum yum is used to say that food tastes or smells

61
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:36,399
very good. And dig in is another exclamation, meaning don't wait, start eating and eat as much as

62
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:41,680
you like. For Ghanaians, Kenki is comfort food, something which is enjoyable to

63
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,639
eat and makes you feel happier. And what's more, it fills your tummy or stomach.

64
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,400
Whatever type you eat and wherever in the world you eat them,

65
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,639
dumplings are a great way to spread a little love, including in Britain.

66
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,840
Ah yes, it looks like we're back to my earlier question.

67
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,160
I asked you what the traditional British suet dumpling is made from.

68
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,199
Beth guessed it was animal fat, which was the correct answer.

69
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,959
Suet dumplings aren't the healthiest, but for some brits, they're certainly comfort food.

70
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:18,159
Food that makes you feel happier because it tastes good or because it reminds you of home.

71
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:22,959
Okay, let's recap the rest of the vocabulary we've learned in this programme,

72
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:28,800
starting with the idiom hits the spot, meaning that something is satisfying and exactly what you

73
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,800
wanted. A staple food is a basic and important type of food that is regularly eaten by a large

74
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,600
portion of the population. The exclamation yum yum is used to say that food tastes or smells

75
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,280
delicious. If you say dig in, you're inviting someone to start eating as much as they want.

76
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,759
And finally, tummy is an informal word for stomach. Once again, our six minutes are up,

77
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,600
but remember to join us again next time for more trending topics and useful vocabulary here
