6-Nate English from the BBC.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,160
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English,

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,919
the show that brings you an interesting topic,

6
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:17,519
authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary.

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,160
I'm Dan.

8
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:27,199
I'm Neil.

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,039
We'll be discussing dogs being used in cancer detection.

10
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,240
Everything okay, Neil?

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,519
Oh, I'm so tired.

12
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:37,759
One of my children is a sick as a dog.

13
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,960
I didn't sleep all night long looking after them.

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,840
As sick as a dog is an expression meaning very ill.

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,120
I'm sorry to hear it.

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,399
Try and hold on if you can.

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,239
Don't worry.

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,159
There's life in this whole dog yet.

19
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:50,799
Good.

20
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,359
It's funny that you mentioned dogs because the UK's

21
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,239
National Health Service is currently assessing where the dogs

22
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,679
can be used to detect early stage prostate cancer.

23
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,640
Amazing.

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,600
Any success?

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,840
Let me ask you in this week's question.

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,560
In what percentage of cases were dogs able to detect

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,799
the presence of cancer in urine?

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,840
Is it A, 50%, B, 70% or C, 90%?

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,560
I'm going to guess A, 50%.

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,200
We'll find out later if you're right or wrong.

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,079
So, Neil, I say dog, what do you think?

32
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:28,640
A wet nose, four paws, which is what we call the feet of certain animals.

33
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,640
Fluffy coat and a waggy tail, man's best friend.

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,799
But I've never heard of cancer dogs.

35
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,799
I wonder what makes them suitable.

36
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,319
Well, I'll let Dr. Claire Guest, CEO of the charity Medical Detection Dogs, take that one.

37
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:47,680
Although the dog has a fluffy coat and a waggy tail, he is in fact a highly sophisticated

38
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,959
biosensor.

39
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,559
You know, evolution is given in this highly sensitive nose.

40
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:54,079
Go down to parts of the trillions.

41
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,359
People bore planes every day.

42
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,799
There have been screened by detected dogs to see if they're exposed to some board.

43
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,519
Why do we rely on them now and yet not in the systems with help?

44
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,159
So, dogs have evolved to have a highly developed sense of smell that allows them to act as a biosensor,

45
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,680
a sensor which uses a living thing to detect chemicals.

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,319
Yes, and she mentioned that humans have a history of using dogs in security

47
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,719
to screen or examine for suitability, for explosives and bombs.

48
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,120
Yep.

49
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,719
Can you think of any other places that dogs are used to support humans?

50
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,359
Well, there's guide dogs or seeing eye dogs as they're known in North America.

51
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:32,560
They help people who are blind to avoid danger.

52
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,359
Nice.

53
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:34,560
Any more?

54
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,680
Maybe around the home.

55
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,039
Are you referring to guard dogs, meaning a dog which keeps a house or place safe from burglary,

56
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,240
theft or trespassing?

57
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,879
Yep.

58
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,879
X burglars have often said that there are much bigger deterrent or reason not to do something

59
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,080
than an alarm system.

60
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,760
Oh, and there's rescue dogs.

61
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,040
They're trained to search and find victims of natural disasters,

62
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,520
such as avalanches or earthquakes.

63
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,560
Exactly.

64
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,600
Dogs are perfect for situations where people may be buried under the earth or the snow.

65
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,200
A human can't see them, but a dog can still smell them.

66
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,160
Do you think our national health service will employ them as full-time biosensors, then?

67
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,599
Well, I don't know, but here's what Jeremy Hunt, the UK health secretary, had to say on the matter.

68
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,240
One of our jobs as MPs is sometimes to question orthodoxies,

69
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,199
so if this research is good, then I want to know about it, and I will certainly look at it carefully.

70
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,000
He mentions that this type of research goes against orthodoxies or generally accepted ways of

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,599
doing things, but he also mentions that he will be looking at it carefully.

72
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,560
So let's hope so.

73
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,719
Yes, I wouldn't mind having a dog doctor.

74
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:42,960
And speaking of research, there was a question I need to know the answer to.

75
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,919
Oh, yes.

76
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:49,919
I asked you in what percentage of cases were dogs able to detect the presence of cancer in urine?

77
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,520
A, 50%, B, 70%, or C, 90%.

78
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,400
And I said, 50%.

79
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,240
It's a dog's life, Neil, I'm sorry.

80
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,479
The answer was C, 90%.

81
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:01,680
Wow, 90%.

82
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,120
That's amazing, isn't it?

83
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,879
Shall we go through the vocabulary?

84
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,120
Okay, the first expression we had was as sick as a dog.

85
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,719
If you are as sick as a dog, it means that you're very sick indeed.

86
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,120
When was the last time you were as sick as a dog, Neil?

87
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,319
Oh, just after Christmas, I caught a bug from my kids.

88
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:20,240
Oh, I was as sick as a dog.

89
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:22,319
Next, we had paws.

90
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,480
Paws are the feet of certain animals.

91
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,319
They have pads and claws.

92
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:28,159
Can you give us a few examples, Dan?

93
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:32,800
Well, dogs have paws, so do cats, rabbits, bears, and mice.

94
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,199
But not horses, sheep, or pigs, they have hooves.

95
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,360
After paws, we had biosensor.

96
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,120
A biosensor is a combination of the words biology and sensor.

97
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,199
It is a sensor which uses a living thing to detect chemicals.

98
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,600
Can you think of a famous historical example, Neil?

99
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,680
Well, miners in danger of highly toxic but invisible gas,

100
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,240
called methane, used to carry a canary and a cage down the mine with them.

101
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,080
If the canary became ill or died, they knew the air was toxic.

102
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,000
Then we had screen.

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,120
If you screen something, it means you examine it for its suitability,

104
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,280
such as luggage going through an airport,

105
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,600
where they would screen for explosives.

106
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,120
How else can it be used, Dan?

107
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,680
Well, these days you can get an ad block on your computer

108
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,560
that will screen out those annoying pop-up adverts.

109
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,439
I hate those.

110
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,160
After that was deterrent.

111
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,360
A deterrent is a thing which stops a person from doing something,

112
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,000
such as the fear of punishment for a crime.

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,560
How do you deter your children for being naughty, Neil?

114
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,360
Oh, that's easy.

115
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,240
I just threatened to remove a sticker from their sticker charts.

116
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,519
Huh, good idea.

117
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,839
Finally, we heard orthodoxies.

118
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,680
An orthodoxy is a generally accepted way of doing things.

119
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,519
Its adjective is orthodox, and we often hear its opposite word,

120
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,680
unorthodox, meaning unusual.

121
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,600
Do you do anything unorthodox, Dan?

122
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,680
Well, I love to combine hot sausages and cold vanilla ice cream.

123
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,639
It's delicious, but no one will trust me enough to try.

124
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,079
Well, I don't blame them.

125
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,959
Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

See you there.

130
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:08,079
Goodbye.

131
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:08,639
Bye-bye.
