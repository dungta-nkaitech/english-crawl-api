00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,280
Hello, this is 6 Minute English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,719
Joining me is Rob.

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:17,519
Hello.

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,960
Rob, when we think of Easter, what do we think of?

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,920
Chocolate.

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,760
Well, yes, chocolate Easter eggs are an obvious symbol of Easter,

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,679
but there is an animal people often associate with Easter.

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,399
Rabbits, cute, adorable and fluffy. What's not to like about a rabbit?

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,719
Well, not everyone is a fan of them.

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,840
By not a fan of, I mean they don't like them.

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,079
Some people think they are a pest,

16
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,719
but we'll be telling you more about rabbits shortly.

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,840
That's good to know.

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,000
Well, I'll tell you what I am a fan of,

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,760
and that is your quiz questions.

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,359
So, what are you going to ask me today?

21
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,399
It's all about wild rabbits.

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,519
In the last rabbit survey in 1995,

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,640
how many were estimated to exist in the UK?

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,560
Was it a 370,500?

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:11,840
B, 3,750,000, or C, 37,500,000?

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,159
I know rabbits are everywhere in the UK,

27
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,320
but not 37 million of them,

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,400
so I'll go for B, 3,750,000.

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,520
Well, you'll have to wait until the end of the programme to find out,

30
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,879
but you're right when you say rabbits are everywhere in the UK.

31
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,519
It's probably true in other countries too.

32
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,359
You could say they are endemic,

33
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:35,679
meaning very common or strongly established in a place or situation.

34
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,479
But are they a typically British wild animal?

35
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,159
They are now, but it's believed they were brought to the country by invaders.

36
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,799
Some say the Romans, others, the Normans,

37
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,519
but they eventually spread across the UK.

38
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,399
Victoria Dickinson is author of a book called Rabbit,

39
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,280
and she's been telling the BBC Radio 4 programme,

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,799
costing the earth about what helped them spread.

41
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,760
It was really by the middle of the 17th century,

42
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,240
when people really started to think about rabbit as being particularly British.

43
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,159
And certainly there were more rabbits in Britain than the rest of Europe.

44
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,639
There was a calculation done that there are over 400 villages and towns in Britain

45
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,520
with the word Warren in their name.

46
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,080
So the rabbits were raised in Britain,

47
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,400
but they really kept to their warrants until

48
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,920
there was the rise of fox hunting.

49
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,080
When their predators disappeared,

50
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,920
rabbits do what rabbits do best,

51
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,840
and they started to multiply and become wild,

52
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,120
our feral rabbits throughout the land.

53
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,280
So Victoria knows a thing or two about rabbits and said the word Warren,

54
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,040
used in town and village names,

55
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,200
is evidence that they've been in the UK since the mid 17th century.

56
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,800
A Warren is the area underground where rabbits live with lots of holes

57
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,320
and connected passages.

58
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,880
But today we use the word Warren to mean a building or part of a town

59
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,080
where there are lots of confusing passageways or streets.

60
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,000
It's a kind of place where you get lost.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,920
But it was rabbit warrants where rabbits would live until hunting,

62
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,640
particularly fox hunting, was introduced,

63
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,360
and that killed many of the rabbits predators.

64
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,040
A predator is an animal that hunts and kills another animal.

65
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,160
Now Victoria was talking about feral rabbits,

66
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,879
so wild rabbits, not the sort people keep as pets in a rabbit hutch.

67
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:28,879
Moving on, I'm interested to know why not everyone loves these cute little creatures.

68
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,560
I mean, think of the rabbit characters in the bitrix potter stories.

69
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,639
Well, they weren't always well behaved,

70
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,879
and Victoria Dickinson spoke to the costing the earth program about this.

71
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,680
What word did she use to describe rabbits having the two opposite sides to their character?

72
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,640
The rabbit is a paradoxical animal.

73
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,800
It has a lot of faces, if you will.

74
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,520
It's both wild and tame.

75
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,680
It's timid, but also has its reputation as trickster rabbit,

76
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,280
if you think of Peter Cottontale or you think of rare rabbits.

77
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,520
And I think our relationship with rabbit is the rabbit of the nursery rhyme,

78
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,280
the rabbit of childhood, or you think of Peter Rabbit.

79
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,400
She said that rabbits are paradoxical animals.

80
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,079
That's the word that describes them having two opposing characteristics.

81
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,199
Yes, we think of them as wild, maybe a trickster,

82
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,759
someone who deceives people to get what they want.

83
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,079
Like Peter, what a cheeky rabbit.

84
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,480
But we also think of rabbits as tame.

85
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,399
We have nursery rhymes about them.

86
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:30,959
Kids have soft, cuddly rabbit toys.

87
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:33,920
I say that they're the perfect symbol for Easter.

88
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,519
OK, Rob, if you say so.

89
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,639
But now let me give the answer to the question I said you earlier.

90
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,160
In the last survey of rabbits in 1995,

91
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,200
how many were estimated to exist in the UK?

92
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,800
Was it A, 370,500?

93
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,800
B, 3,750,000, or C, 37,500,000.

94
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,160
Rob, what did you say?

95
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,840
I said B, 3,750,000.

96
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,000
Well, you're wrong, Rob.

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,360
A government survey put the population in the UK at 37.5 million,

98
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,040
so a lot more.

99
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,160
But despite its reputation, a recent survey suggests

100
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,920
rabbit numbers in the UK have declined by around 60% over the last 20 years.

101
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,520
That is sad news.

102
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,920
But let's cheer ourselves up with a recap of the vocabulary we've discussed today,

103
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,920
starting with a fan of.

104
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,120
When someone is a fan of something, they are keen on it.

105
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,720
They like it a lot.

106
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,439
If you're not a fan of something, you don't like it.

107
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,120
We mentioned endemic, meaning very common or strongly established

108
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,800
in a place or situation.

109
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,720
And we talked about a Warren, an underground area where rabbits live,

110
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,800
but also a building or a part of a town where there are lots of confusing

111
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,319
passageways or streets where it's easy to get lost.

112
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,759
A predator is an animal that hunts and kills another animal.

113
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,680
Paradoxical describes things that have two opposing characteristics,

114
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,360
making it hard to understand.

115
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,120
And a trickster is someone who deceives people to get what they want.

116
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,560
Well, I know trickster.

117
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,840
It really has been six minutes, so it's time to call it a day.

118
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,599
Please join us next time.

119
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:10,399
Bye for now.

120
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,199
Goodbye.
