Hello, this is 6 Minute English, I'm Rob.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:15,919
And I'm Sam.

5
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,879
In this program, we're talking about biscuits.

6
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,359
Really? That's not what I was told.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,920
Oh, hold on, you're lying.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,600
Yes, you're right, Sam.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,800
I am lying simply to demonstrate our topic.

10
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,920
Lying and how to detect it, you detected my lie very easily, Sam.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,120
I could tell from the smirk on your face that you were telling a fib.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,640
That's the word for a small, inoffensive lie.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,519
To be honest, talking about lie detecting will be much more interesting than biscuits.

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,600
But first, let's start with a question for you to answer.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,519
A competition is held in Cumbria in the UK every year to find and award the title of

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,000
the biggest liar in the world.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,440
But which type of people are not allowed to take part?

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,320
A, farmers, B, lawyers, or C, estate agents?

19
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,600
What do you think, Sam?

20
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,480
Well, I'd be lying if I said I knew, but based on personal experience,

21
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,400
I'd say estate agents.

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,079
They'd find it too easy.

23
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,800
Ah, well, that's your opinion, but I'll let you know if you're right at the end of the program.

24
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,120
So, lying is something I'm sure a lot of us do.

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,480
Sometimes to avoid trouble, sometimes to cheat people,

26
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,880
or sometimes just to impress someone.

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,520
Did you know I can speak seven languages, Sam?

28
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,160
That's just a bare face lie, Rob.

29
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,040
But I can see how easy lying can be, and that's what neuroscientists Sophie Scott thinks.

30
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,439
Here she is on BBC Radio 4's seriously podcast,

31
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,560
explaining how we sometimes lie just to be nice.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,880
Often what we mean by lying is someone setting out two DCs with their words or their

33
00:01:54,879 --> 00:02:00,719
actions, but actually normal conversation probably can only happen because we don't actually say

34
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,319
all the time exactly what we really think and what we really mean.

35
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,599
And that kind of cooperation is at the heart, I think, of a lot of social interactions for humans,

36
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,280
and I think that's one of the strong pushes to make conversation polite,

37
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,000
and therefore frequently not actually truthful.

38
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,039
So, Sophie mentions two types of lying.

39
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,759
There's the one where we try to deceive someone,

40
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,000
so that's trying to hide something by tricking someone to gain an advantage.

41
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:32,879
That's like you're getting me to pay £10 for a cinematic it,

42
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,879
when actually there were only £5.

43
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:41,680
That's just dishonest, but there are also what we like to call white lies.

44
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,719
Small lies we tell to avoid obsessing someone.

45
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:48,719
Those are lies that aren't intended to give you an advantage.

46
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,079
Yes, Sophie Scott says we use them in normal conversation.

47
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,640
When we don't say what we really mean.

48
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,600
So we want to make conversation polite because we want to cooperate with each other.

49
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,080
She says cooperation is at the heart.

50
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,600
Something that's at the heart is the most important or essential part.

51
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,200
Now, telling lies is one thing, but how do you know if we're being lied to?

52
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,400
Sometimes there are telltale signs, such as someone's face turning red or someone

53
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,599
shuffling their feet.

54
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,040
But if you really want to know if someone is lying, maybe we should listen to Richard Weisman,

55
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,920
a psychologist at the University of Hertfordshire.

56
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,879
He or he is speaking on the seriously podcast.

57
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,560
Lies in general say less.

58
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,240
They tend to have a longer what's called response latency, which is the time between the end

59
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,400
of the question and the beginning of the answer.

60
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,879
And that also tends to be an emotional distance in the lie.

61
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,960
So the words me, my, I, all those things tend to drop away in lies.

62
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,439
And it's much, much harder for lies to control what they're saying and how they're saying it.

63
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,199
So focus your attention there.

64
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,560
You become a better lie detector.

65
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,199
Hmm, some good advice from Richard Weisman.

66
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:10,319
So to detect lies, we need to listen out for the response latency.

67
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,599
A term using psychology to describe the time taken between a stimulus or question

68
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,879
and a response to it.

69
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,040
The bigger the gap, the more chance there is that someone is lying.

70
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,319
Is that a good summary, Sam?

71
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,719
Hmm, sort of, Rob.

72
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:32,159
Richard also suggests we focus on or concentrate on what and how people are saying things too.

73
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,600
There's probably more to it than just that.

74
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,759
Well, now you know how to detect my lies, Sam.

75
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,800
Maybe honesty is the best policy, as they say.

76
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,600
So I'm now going to give you an honest answer to the question I asked earlier.

77
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:53,199
A competition is held in Cumbry in the UK every year to award the title of the biggest liar in the world.

78
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,040
But which type of people are not allowed to take part?

79
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,600
A, farmers, B, lawyers or C, estate agents.

80
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,280
Well, I guess C, estate agents.

81
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,519
And you are wrong, I'm afraid.

82
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,039
Lawyers, as well as politicians, are not allowed to enter the competition.

83
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,919
It's claimed they are judged to be too skilled at telling porquies.

84
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,039
Porquies is an informal word for pork pies and that rhymes with lies.

85
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,599
Hmm, fascinating stuff, Rob.

86
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:26,560
And that's no lie.

87
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,479
But now shall we recap some of the vocabulary we've heard today?

88
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,199
Yeah, why not?

89
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,399
A fib is a small, inoffensive lie.

90
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,239
A white lie is also a small lie told to avoid upsetting someone.

91
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:45,919
When you deceive someone, you try to hide something by tricking them to gain an advantage.

92
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:52,159
When something is at the heart of something, it is the most important or essential part of it.

93
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:58,560
And we heard about response latency, a term used in psychology to describe the time taken

94
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,120
between a stimulus or question and a response to it.

95
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,399
Okay, thank you Sam.

96
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,399
That's all from 6 Minute English.

97
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:08,560
We look forward to your company next time.

98
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,360
Goodbye.

99
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,319
Bye everyone.
