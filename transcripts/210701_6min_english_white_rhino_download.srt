00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,879
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:18,160
And I'm Sam.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,679
In this programme, we'll be hearing a new story linked to the nature versus nurture debate,

8
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,280
not concerning a human, but a rhinoceros.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,960
The extremely rare Northern white rhino of East Africa was on the brink of extinction

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,600
when the second to last living male, Sunny, died in 2014, leaving behind two females,

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,359
Nagine and Fattu, the last living creatures of their species.

12
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,799
Conservationist started an artificial breeding programme, using eggs from the females and sperm from

13
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,799
Sunny to produce an embryo, an unborn animal in the very early stages of development.

14
00:00:57,919 --> 00:01:02,640
Recently, there's been a new development in the story, but before we hear more, it's time for my

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,280
quiz question. The name rhinoceros comes from the ancient Greek, but what exactly does it mean?

16
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,799
Is it A, thick skin, B, horned nose, or C, small eye?

17
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,560
Ooh, that's a tricky one because rhinos have all three.

18
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,319
Okay, I'll guess A, thick skin.

19
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,679
Okay, Sam will find out later. Now let's get back to the story of those precious northern rhino

20
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:36,400
embryos. Well, the good news is that so far five embryos have been produced. They're being frozen

21
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:43,200
until they can be implanted in southern rhinos. The Northern species is more common cousin.

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,439
Conservationist Thomas Hildebrand runs the Rhino breeding programme. He spoke to BBC World

23
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,799
Services Science in Action, who asked him whether the embryos were genetically from the northern species.

24
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:04,320
Absolutely right, that's a hybrid that's pure northern rhinos embryos, which were generated

25
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:13,439
with the desire breeding partner, SUNY, who died in 2014. So we have embryos which have a very

26
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:20,319
high quality. There's no inbreeding effect on these embryos, and it is so important to

27
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,639
make the next step to transfer these embryos because we can preserve life biologically

28
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:32,799
material in liquid nitrogen, but what we can't do, we can't preserve social knowledge. And

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,200
therefore we need desperately a calf on the ground so that these two existing northern rhinos can

30
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:48,800
teach the new calf how to behave as a northern right rhino. Having genetically pure embryos

31
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,080
prevents the birth of hybrids, animals that have been bred from two different species.

32
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,800
It's also important the embryos have no inbreeding. Breeding of a young animal from two closely

33
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,680
related parents, because this can cause disease. Fortunately, Thomas and his team have preserved

34
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,480
five healthy and genetically pure northern rhino embryos in liquid nitrogen. But while they can

35
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,320
preserve nature, what Thomas's team can't provide is nurture. The social knowledge that a young

36
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:26,640
northern rhino or calf can only learn from other northern rhinos. And since Najin and Fattu,

37
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:33,119
the last remaining northern rhinos on earth, are getting old, the race is on to breed a young

38
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:38,799
rhino calf before they die. The good news for the survival of the northern white rhino is that

39
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,599
experiments to implant the delicate embryos in southern rhinos have been successful.

40
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,799
Here's Thomas Hilderand again, talking about these recent experiments with BBC World Service

41
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:56,560
Program Science in Action. We will for sure not wait until this pregnancy is completed,

42
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:04,240
because it takes 16 months for a full pregnancy in a rhino to us. So if this embryo implants,

43
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:10,640
and we can see that in ultrasound and form a nice placenta, that is the goal for us to proceed

44
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,280
with the next step on the northern white rhino embryos. Normally, it takes 16 months for a female

45
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,799
rhino to complete her pregnancy, the state in which a woman or female animal has a baby developing

46
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:28,959
inside her. But in the case of the northern rhino, the race is on to birth calves who can learn the

47
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:35,519
rhino rules of social behaviour from Antinagin and Granny Fattu while they're still alive.

48
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:42,399
Which is why conservationists are monitoring the pregnancy using ultrasound, a procedure using

49
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:48,239
sound waves to create images of internal body parts, or in this case, growing rhino babies.

50
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,199
It's an unusual episode in the ongoing nature versus nurture debate.

51
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,399
And hopefully a big step towards restoring the northern white rhino population,

52
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:03,279
so that future generations get to see these magnificent creatures with their thick skin,

53
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:09,439
horn nose and... And small eyes, Neil. So what was the answer to your question?

54
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,759
Yes, I asked you what the name rhinoceros meant. What did you say, Sam?

55
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,120
I guessed it was a thick skin. Was I right?

56
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,439
Well, rhino certainly do have thick skin, but their name actually comes from the Greek meaning

57
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:29,600
horned nose. Hmm, well luckily I've got a thick skin too, so I won't take it personally.

58
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:34,399
Let's have another look at the vocabulary we've learned, starting with embryo,

59
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,000
an unborn animal or human, still inside its mother's womb.

60
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,120
A hybrid is an animal or plant that has been bred from two different species.

61
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,279
Inbreeding is when a young animal is born from closely related parents.

62
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:53,920
A calf is the name for the young of several large mammals including cows, elephants and whales,

63
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,040
as well as rhinos. Pregnancy means being pregnant or growing a baby inside you.

64
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:05,040
And finally, ultrasound is used to see internal organs or a baby developing inside a woman.

65
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,800
And that's all from this species saving edition of Sixth-Vide English.

66
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,840
Goodbye. Bye-bye.
