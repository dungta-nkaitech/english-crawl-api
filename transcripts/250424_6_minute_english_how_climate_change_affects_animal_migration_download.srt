Hello and welcome to 6-Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Beth

3
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,080
and I'm Neil. You can find a transcript and worksheet for this podcast on our website

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,719
bbclearningenglish.com. So Neil, today we're talking about animal migration.

5
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,679
That's the movement of animals from one place to another, usually because of the weather

6
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:35,280
or temperature. Yes, for example, will the beast are famous for their migration? They travel

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,679
around the Serengeti in Tanzania and the Masai Mara in Kenya every year depending on the rain.

8
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:47,359
It's often called the Great Migration. Yes and I have a question for you about this Neil.

9
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:54,719
How many animals are thought to take part in the Great Migration every year? Is it a 1 million,

10
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:04,879
b 1.5 million or c 2.5 million? Well, I don't know, but I'm going to guess 2.5 million.

11
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,560
Okay, I'll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Now, will the beast are not the only

12
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,039
animals who travel large distances? That's right. Many sharks also migrate. They move to a different

13
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:22,560
place because of the weather or temperature. Trisha, at word, researches sharks and their migration

14
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:28,799
for Utah State University and explained more to BBC World Service programme, the Climate Question.

15
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,480
Animals migrate for all types of reasons. Some of them migrate for food resources,

16
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:41,520
things like mating or for giving birth. So, animals can migrate for food, mating and giving birth.

17
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,840
Host of the BBC World Services, the climate question Sophie Eastor wanted to know more.

18
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,359
And what kind of distances are we talking with these migrations? Are they covering huge swathes of

19
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:58,800
ocean? Some of these sharks species can travel massive distances. We've seen great white sharks that

20
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:06,159
have travelled from the coast off of Perth, Australia, all the way to South Africa. Sophie asks, what kinds of

21
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,800
distances are we talking with these migrations? This is an informal way to ask how far are the

22
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,439
migrations? We can rephrase lots of questions in this way. For example, you could ask, what kind of

23
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:26,400
price are we talking to ask how much something costs? Sophie goes on to ask whether sharks travel across

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:35,439
huge swathes of ocean. Swathes of ocean means large areas of ocean. Yes, and in fact, sharks do travel

25
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:42,080
across large areas. For example, great white sharks can travel from Australia to South Africa. That

26
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,000
is a long way to swim. But as climate change causes changes to the temperature of the ocean,

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,240
it's changing the way that sharks migrate. This is a problem. Sharks scare away other creatures,

28
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,600
such as sea turtles. And these creatures eat sea grass, which absorbs a lot of carbon from

29
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:05,520
the atmosphere. So basically, when the sharks are around, there's more sea grass on the ocean floor

30
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:11,920
and so more carbon is absorbed. So sharks can actually help fight climate change. Yes, in fact,

31
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:17,599
lots of species that migrate are really important for fighting climate change. Let's say more from

32
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,759
BBC World Service Programme, the climate question. Sharks aren't the only migratory animal that acts

33
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:30,000
as a secret weapon against climate change. Research that we worked on shows that by just managing

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,919
about 10 groups of animals, we could be taking out or sequestering morissio 2 from the atmosphere

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,919
by about six gigatons of carbon per year. So for perspective, some experts say that we need to suck

36
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:52,560
10 gigatons of CO2 a year out of the atmosphere to meet our climate goals. So if he says that many

37
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,479
animals that migrate, like sharks, are a secret weapon against climate change, a secret weapon

38
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:03,759
is something nobody knows about that will give you an advantage over a problem or enemy.

39
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,199
By protecting sharks and other animals that migrate, Tricia's research shows that we could be

40
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:16,560
sequestering six gigatons of carbon dioxide or CO2 a year from the atmosphere. So,

41
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,599
question means remove and store the carbon, for example, implants like sea grass. Six gigatons

42
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:30,079
is a lot of carbon. Sophie says that for perspective, it's about 60 percent of the amounts of carbon

43
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,839
dioxide that some scientists believe we need to remove from the atmosphere each year. We can

44
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:41,680
use the phrase for perspective to explain the size or importance of something, particularly when

45
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,680
it's difficult to imagine that thing. Alongside sharks, another species that Tricia believes is

46
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,039
important to helping remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is the wills beast. Yes,

47
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:58,719
and that reminds me of your question, Beth. You asked me how many animals take part in the great

48
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:06,880
migration and I think I went for option C2.5 million. Was I right? You weren't. I'm afraid.

49
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:14,240
The answer was B1.5 million, so still a lot of animals. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've

50
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,720
learnt starting with migrate. Move to a different place. For animals, this is usually because of the

51
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,680
weather or temperature. We can use the structure, what kind of something are we talking to rephrase a

52
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,759
question more informally, particularly one about distance, cost or numbers. For example, what kind

53
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:40,960
of distance are we talking? Swathes means large areas of something. A secret weapon is something nobody

54
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,960
knows about that gives you an advantage over a problem or enemy. If you sequester something, such as

55
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,439
carbon dioxide, you remove it and store it. And we can use the phrase for perspective to explain

56
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,719
the size or importance of something, particularly if that thing is difficult to imagine.

57
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:04,639
Once again, our six minutes are up. Why not test what you've learnt using the interactive quiz
