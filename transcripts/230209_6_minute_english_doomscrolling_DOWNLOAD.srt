Hello, this is 6 minutes English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,280
And I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,800
Have you heard the expression, Doom's scrolling, Neil?

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,879
It's when people spend a lot of time reading or scrolling,

7
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,679
a mobile phone or computer screen in order to read negative news stories.

8
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,359
Stories full of doom.

9
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,119
I hate to admit it, but I do sometimes doom scroll.

10
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,320
Well, don't feel too bad, Neil, because you're not alone.

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,679
Research from the University of California found that people all over the world doom scroll,

12
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:45,359
regardless of culture.

13
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,480
What's more, there may even be evolutionary reasons why we're attracted to bad news.

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:58,000
In this programme, we'll be investigating why we feel compelled to look at and even seek out bad news.

15
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,359
And as usual, we'll be learning some new vocabulary as well.

16
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,759
But before that, I have a question for you, Neil.

17
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,640
Doom's scrolling is a very modern idea, which is only possible with the 24-7 non-stop cycle of news

18
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,560
reporting. So according to international news agency Roeces, what has been the top global

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:25,120
news story of 2023 so far? Is it A, the war in Ukraine, B, increasing prices and inflation, or C,

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,600
Prince Harry's autobiography?

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,320
I think the answer is an issue that's affecting everyone in inflation.

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,359
Okay, Neil. I'll reveal the answer at the end of the programme.

23
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,400
Now, it might be true that the non-stop news cycle makes doom scrolling possible,

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,520
but that doesn't explain why we do it. Anthropologist Ella Alshamahi thinks the answer may lie in human

25
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,960
evolution. Here she outlines the problem for BBC Radio 4 programme. Why do we do that?

26
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:59,199
We go searching out for bad news, looking for things that will make us feel IK inside.

27
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:05,919
And so many of us do it. Is it a result of 24-7 doom on tap on our phones?

28
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,240
Or is it some kind of compulsion that comes from somewhere way, way back?

29
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:19,519
Reading bad news stories makes us feel IK, an informal American phrase which means feel sick,

30
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,719
often because of something disgusting or disturbing. It's a feeling caused by the fact that

31
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:31,120
thanks to the internet, now we have the news on tap, easily available so that you can have as much

32
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,240
of it as you want whenever you want. But Ella thinks that's not the whole story.

33
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,080
There's another theory, way back in human history when we lived in caves, it seemed everything

34
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,240
could kill us from wild animals to eating the wrong mushroom. Knowing what the dangers were and how

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:55,920
to avoid them was vital to our survival. And from an evolutionary perspective, survival is everything.

36
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,400
As a result, we humans naturally pay attention to the negative stuff, something Ella calls

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,560
negativity bias. But while cavemen only knew what was happening in their local area,

38
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,240
nowadays we know the bad news from all over the world. Here's Ella again, discussing this with

39
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:20,000
her friend, TV presenter Clara Ampho, for BBC Radio 4 program, why do we do that?

40
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,560
You know, before it would be like, I don't know, I'm assuming you'd go to the neighbor's cave,

41
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,640
and they don't really know the bad news from that particular mountain.

42
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,040
Yeah.

43
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,560
It's now, it's like, let me tell you about the really bad information and situation that's going on

44
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,719
in some island somewhere. It's just that the good news doesn't make up for it.

45
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,000
It really doesn't and it's, I think, trauma is very man-sized.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,639
Really? It doesn't kill you, you make it stronger.

47
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,800
This is a test. I think we're conditioned to believe that negative experiences shape

48
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,159
possible than joyous ones.

49
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:58,879
Reading bad news from around the world can depress us, and Ella thinks that the little good news we

50
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,960
do here doesn't make up for the depressing news. To make up for something means to compensate

51
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,520
for something bad with something good.

52
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:14,880
Good news is hard to find. In fact, Clara thinks society has romanticized bad traumatic news.

53
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,560
If you romanticize something, you talk about it in a way that makes it sound better than it really is.

54
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,759
Connected to this is the saying, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger,

55
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,280
meaning that by going through difficult experiences in life,

56
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,240
people build up strength and resilience for the future.

57
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,680
Maybe it's best to stop doom scrolling altogether.

58
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,480
But with so much bad news pouring into our mobile phones every day, it's not easy.

59
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay, it's time to reveal the answer to my question, Neil.

60
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,720
I asked you, what news agency Reuters considers the top new story of 2023 so far?

61
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,040
And I guessed it was B inflation.

62
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
Which was the correct answer.

63
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,600
Although there's still plenty of time for 2023 to bring us more doom,

64
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,319
hopefully along with a little positivity too.

65
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,079
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this program about doom scrolling,

66
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,759
spending lots of time reading bad news stories on your phone.

67
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:18,159
Feeling Ick is American slang for feeling sick, often because of something disgusting or disturbing.

68
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:23,759
When something is on tap, it's easily available so that you can have as much of it as you want.

69
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:30,159
The fraisel verb to make up for something means to compensate for something bad with something good.

70
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,520
When we romanticize something, we make it sound better than it is.

71
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,000
And finally, the saying what doesn't kill you makes you stronger means that by going through

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,320
difficult life experiences, people build up strength for the future.

73
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,920
Once again, our six minutes are up, but if doom scrolling's not for you, remember you can find

74
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,560
lots of positive news stories to build you vocabulary here at six minute English.

75
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,280
Don't forget that there is more to BBC learning English than six minute English.

76
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,000
Why not try to improve your vocabulary through the language in news headlines?

78
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:09,759
But that's by for now. Bye.
