00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,120
Hello, this is 6 Minute English and I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,640
And joining me today is Rob.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,440
Hello.

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,519
Rob, how do you feel about shopping?

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,080
Ugh, mooching around a shopping mall from one shop to another spending money,

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,600
it's my idea of hell.

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,039
How about shopping online?

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,559
Yes, much better.

13
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,240
Sitting in front of the TV and browsing online is much easier.

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,399
Well, that can be a problem.

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,359
It's sometimes too easy, especially when we are tired

16
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,000
and we sometimes make purchases we regret.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,479
That's what we'll be talking about in this programme,

18
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,599
an activity known as vampire shopping.

19
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:49,359
But before we continue, it's my job to set you a quiz question.

20
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:50,320
So here goes.

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,600
According to the UK's Office for National Statistics,

22
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:59,439
at the end of 2018, what percentage of all retail sales took place online?

23
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,160
Was it A, 9.8%?

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,120
B, 19.8% or C, 29.8%.

25
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,439
Buying things online is big business now,

26
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,480
so I'll say C, 29.8%.

27
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,560
Well, you'll have to wait a bit to find out,

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,840
but let's talk more now about vampire shopping.

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,159
This term refers to shopping late at night,

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,719
traditionally a time when vampires appear.

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,200
Most of us are asleep at this time,

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,280
but sleep deprived parents,

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,760
shift workers and gamers might not be.

34
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,799
If you're an insomniac, someone who can't sleep easily,

35
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,079
it's tempting to open up your laptop and start shopping.

36
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,560
Online shops are open 24 hours a day,

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,519
so it's easy to get sucked in and do some shopping.

38
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,359
When you get sucked into something,

39
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,239
it means you can't stop yourself getting involved with something

40
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,680
that you didn't want to do.

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,680
So what you're saying, Neil, is at night,

42
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,480
when we're very tired, we don't always think straight

43
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,079
and can make some bad decisions.

44
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:54,960
That's right.

45
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,480
And this shopping temptation can be particularly problematic

46
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,320
for those with mental health issues.

47
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,719
It's something Helen Undy has been talking about

48
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,760
on the BBC Radio 4 program, You and Yours.

49
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,360
She's the chief executive of the Money and Mental Health Institute.

50
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,960
Let's hear what she had to say.

51
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,240
Our ability to control our impulse to spend

52
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,080
and to resist things like advertising

53
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,000
is reduced when we sleep deprived.

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,480
Well, mental health problems can have a similar effect,

55
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,159
so the mental health problems themselves

56
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,639
make it harder to resist the urge to spend.

57
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,959
And they also cause sleep deprivation,

58
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,359
so you're alone, possibly surfing the internet

59
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:32,000
and both the lack of sleep and the mental health problems

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,479
make it harder to resist the things that you can see.

61
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,159
Helen said that for all of us, when we're at sleep deprived,

62
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,000
that means not having enough sleep,

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,120
we find it harder to resist the urge to shop.

64
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,879
We're more sucked in to shopping by the advertising we see.

65
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,359
And resist the urge means stop yourself

66
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,160
facting on a strong feeling to do something.

67
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,600
But this is more serious for people with mental health issues.

68
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,000
They are particularly sleep deprived

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400
and along with everything that's going on in their minds,

70
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,920
they find it harder to resist to stop themselves buying things.

71
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,400
I suppose buying things at night, if you're alone,

72
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,440
gives you some comfort, even a feel good factor.

73
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,040
Doing something that gives someone a happy and positive feeling.

74
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,280
I certainly feel good when I've bought something,

75
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,240
but Rob, have you ever bought something you regret?

76
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,280
Yes, spits of tech, even flight tickets to somewhere

77
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,840
I didn't really want to go to because they were cheap.

78
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,200
Regret is a sad feeling you get when you've made a mistake

79
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,080
and wished you hadn't made the mistake in the first place.

80
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,439
We all have Regret's Rob, particularly when buying things.

81
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,000
But there's usually the option to return something

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,280
and get a refund.

83
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,439
That's true, but it's not always easy.

84
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,760
Let's hear what Helen Undy had to say about that.

85
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,680
We found in our research that 75% of people,

86
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,480
so regardless of whether you've got a mental health problem or not,

87
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,840
three quarters of people didn't send back the last thing they bought online

88
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,040
that they regretted.

89
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,840
Or we found that four in 10 people with mental health problems

90
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,319
didn't send things back because they were so ashamed

91
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,520
of the things that they were buying

92
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,439
that they just wanted to pretend it never happened.

93
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,439
So she says that three quarters of people didn't send back

94
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,920
the last thing they bought that they regretted.

95
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,520
Maybe they were too embarrassed.

96
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,560
Possibly, but it's not always easy to return an item

97
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,120
and for those with mental health issues, it can be a struggle, a great effort.

98
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,560
Helen Undy says that sometimes they were ashamed of their purchase.

99
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,519
Well, I think we have all bought things we're ashamed of,

100
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,160
but while online shopping continues to expand,

101
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,399
the temptation will always be there.

102
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,600
Well, your question earlier was about the rise in online shopping,

103
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,959
so what's the answer, Neil?

104
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,959
I asked, according to the UK's Office for National Statistics,

105
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:42,319
at the end of 2018, what percentage of all retail sales took place online?

106
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:49,360
Was it A, 9.8%, B, 19.8%, or C, 29.8%.

107
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,120
I said C, 29.8%. I've got to be right.

108
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,159
Well, you're not.

109
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,199
The rise was a bit smaller at B, 19.8%,

110
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,399
but that's still large compared with 10 years previously,

111
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,920
when the figure was just 5.8% of all retail sales.

112
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,399
No doubt the figure will continue to rise.

113
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,519
And before I nip off to do a bit of vampire shopping,

114
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,639
let's recap some of the vocabulary we've mentioned today,

115
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,479
starting with insomniac.

116
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,359
And insomniac is someone who can't sleep easily.

117
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:21,199
They suffer from insomnia.

118
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,399
Next, we talked about to get sucked into something.

119
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,599
This informal phrase means not being able to stop yourself

120
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:30,159
getting involved with something that you don't want to do.

121
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:33,839
If you are sleep deprived, you do not have enough sleep.

122
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,759
And if you resist the urge,

123
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,959
you stop yourself acting on a strong feeling to do something.

124
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,319
For example, resisting the urge to buy something online.

125
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,959
But if you don't resist the urge to buy something,

126
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,359
it might have a feel-good factor.

127
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:51,199
A feel-good factor is something that makes you feel happy and positive.

128
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,479
But after buying something, you may have regret.

129
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,799
That's a sad feeling you get when you've made a mistake

130
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:59,279
and wish you hadn't made the mistake in the first place.

131
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,799
Well, hopefully you haven't regretted spending six minutes listening to us.

132
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:05,199
