Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,440
And I'm Georgina.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,519
Last November, NASA launched a very unusual home delivery service,

5
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:27,039
a rocket carrying four tons of supplies to the ISS, the International Space Station.

6
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:33,759
Among the scientific equipment were 12 bottles of red wine from the famous Bordeaux region of France.

7
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,640
The astronauts might have wanted a glass of wine with dinner,

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,200
but the real purpose of the bottles was to explore the possibility of producing food and drink in space,

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,239
not for astronauts, but for people back on Earth.

10
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,519
In today's programme, we'll be finding out how growing plants in space can develop crops,

11
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:55,759
which are more productive and more resistant to climate change here on Earth.

12
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,479
And we'll hear how plants can grow in environments with little or no natural light.

13
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,120
But first today's quiz question, what was the first food grown in space?

14
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,280
Was it A, potatoes, B, lettuce or sea tomatoes?

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,280
Mmm, well, in the film The Martian, a stranded astronaut grows potatoes on Mars.

16
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,640
I know it's only a film, but I'll say A, potatoes.

17
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,200
Okay, we'll find out the answer later.

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,920
Now, you might be wondering how it's possible to grow plants without natural light.

19
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,680
British company Vertical Future has been working on this problem

20
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,359
by developing indoor farming methods in partnership with NASA.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,640
Here's their head of research, Jen Bromley, explaining the process to BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain.

22
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:48,240
Basically, we use LED lighting, and we use LED lights that are tuned to specific wavelengths.

23
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,159
So if you imagine what the rainbow looks like, the reason a plant looks green

24
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,919
is because it's not using all the green light, it actually reflects a lot of that back.

25
00:01:55,919 --> 00:02:00,959
So the reason why it looks pink in here is because we're actually only using red light and blue light

26
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,079
to grade the plants. And that essentially tailors the light diet,

27
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,560
so that the plants look kind of black when you look at them, because they're not reflecting any light,

28
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,479
they're being super efficient. They're using up every photon that hits them.

29
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,359
The lack of natural light in space means that plants are grown using LED lights.

30
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:27,359
LED is an abbreviation of light emitting diode, an electronic device that lights up when electricity is passed through it.

31
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:33,359
On Earth, plants look green because they reflect back any light traveling at a certain wavelength.

32
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:39,839
The distance between two waves of light, which makes things appear to us in the various colours of the rainbow.

33
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,800
But when scientists control the wavelengths being fed, plants are able to absorb every photon,

34
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,840
particle of light energy, making them appear black.

35
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,360
Each particle of light that hits the leaves is absorbed and through photosynthesis

36
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,280
is converted into plant food. NASA found that different colour combinations or light

37
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,759
recipes can change a plant's shape, size and even flavour.

38
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:10,560
But the lack of natural light isn't the biggest obstacle to growing food in space.

39
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,799
Here's Joy Amassa, Chief Plant Scientist at the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida to explain.

40
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:25,359
Microgravity is really challenging, but plants are amazing. They can adapt to so many different

41
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:30,879
environments, and we call this plasticity, because they can turn on or off their genes to really

42
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,759
adapt to all sorts of conditions, and that's why you see plants growing in different areas on

43
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,560
Earth, the same type of plant may look very different because it's adapting to the environment in

44
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:48,400
that specific location. On Earth, plants use gravity to position themselves, shoots grow up,

45
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,560
roots grow down, but this doesn't apply in space because of microgravity. The weaker pull of

46
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,639
gravity, making things float and seem weightless. Plants can only survive in these conditions,

47
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:06,319
due to their plasticity, the ability of living organisms to adapt and cope with changes in

48
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,159
the environment by changing their biological structure. Plants adapt themselves to being in space

49
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:18,719
by manipulating their genes. Chemicals and DNA in the cells of plants and animals which control

50
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:25,199
their development and behaviour. In the low-gravity atmosphere of space, plants become stressed,

51
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,800
but they adapt genetically. And as a result, they're stronger and more resilient to other

52
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,240
less-dressful events when they return home to Earth. Like those bottles of red wine orbiting

53
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,319
Earth as we speak, the effects of microgravity on the wine's organic composition will be studied

54
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,560
and could hopefully offer solutions for growing food in Earth's changing climate.

55
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,680
So Neil, if it wasn't red grapes, what was the first food grown in space?

56
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,959
Ah yes, in today's quiz question, I asked what the first plant grown in space was.

57
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:05,920
I said A potatoes. But in fact it was. B, lettuce grown over 15 months on the ISS,

58
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,199
and eaten in 15 minutes in the first ever space salad.

59
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,519
Today we've been discussing the possibilities of growing plants in space using LED lights,

60
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,720
devices that use electricity to produce light.

61
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,800
The energy needed for plants to grow is contained in photons or light particles traveling at

62
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,600
different wavelengths. Distances between light waves which make things look different colors.

63
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,160
Plants have evolved over millennia using the strong gravity on Earth, but this changes in space

64
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,880
because of microgravity. The weaker gravitational pull, making things in space float and seem

65
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:48,959
to be a bit more weightless. Luckily plants use their genes, the chemicals in DNA responsible for

66
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,639
growth, to adapt to new environments by changing their biological structure, a process known as

67
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,159
plasticity. All of which makes it possible for astronauts to enjoy a glass of wine and green

68
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:05,279
salad in space. And genetically stronger plant specimens to study back on Earth.

69
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,159
That's all for today, but join us again soon at 6 Minute English. Bye for now. Bye.
