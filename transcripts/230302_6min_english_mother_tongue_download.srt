00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And I'm Rob.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
In this programme, we'll be hearing about an issue experienced by many child refugees

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
who are forced to leave their home.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The loss of their first native language or mother tongue as they start a new life

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
learning to speak a new language in a new country.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Julie Tadevi and her family left their home in what was then Czechoslovakia

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and is now the Czech Republic during the Cold War when Julie was a small child.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
After several years travelling through Europe, they arrived in Canada as political refugees with no English.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We'll be hearing about Julie's childhood when learning English started to replace a native language Czech.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And as usual, we'll be learning some new vocabulary as well.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But first, I have a question, Rob.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Julie's family left their home as political refugees, but every year millions of people are also displaced

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
because of war, persecution or the damaging effects of climate change.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So, according to the United Nations, how many people around the world are currently living as displaced refugees?

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Is it A, 3 million, B, 53 million or C, 103 million?

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll guess it's 103 million.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hmm, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme, Rob.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Like many child refugees, Julie spoke only her mother tongue,

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Czech at home with her brothers, sisters and parents, who in the beginning spoke no English at all.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Here she describes to Michael Rosen, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, Word of Mouth,

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
going to an English-speaking school for the first time.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So you went into school not to start off with really understanding what was going on, is that right?

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's right. I just kind of interpreted things as best I could.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And my memory of that is that that was not particularly difficult or traumatic.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I think by then I'd had the experience of being dunked into various unfamiliar languages numerous times,

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and I had faith that it would sort itself out and that everything would be just fine. And it was, was of course.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000
At school, Julie was dunked into unfamiliar situations, a bit like a biscuit being dunked into a cup of tea.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Often, dunk means to dip something into a liquid, but here the meaning is that Julie was suddenly dropped into a new situation for a while,

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
then taken out has a family travelled through Europe.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
By the time she arrived in Canada, Julie had been exposed to several other languages, including Italian and French.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
She had experienced many difficulties, but never given up hope of finding a new home.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Julie had faith, in other words, trust or confidence that everything would sort itself out,

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
a phrase meaning to stop being a problem automatically without having to do anything.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Over the following years, Julie faced many challenges, going to school and making friends,

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
helping her parents as they struggled in the English-speaking world,

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and grieving for her native language which she slowly forgot.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And with it, the chance to speak Czech with her dad before he passed away.

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Julie shares her thoughts on losing and refinding her mother tongue in her book Memory Speaks.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Through it all, Julie kept alive her belief that by speaking two, three or even more languages,

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
we don't forget who we are, but instead gain a sense of tolerance,

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
an idea which she talked about with BBC Radio 4's Word of Mouse.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The idea that you can be both of Mexican ancestry, for example, and speak Spanish,

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and be a full-fledged American, or in my case, come from a country like the Czech Republic,

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
continue to speak my language, and be Canadian and very proudly,

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
so and very invested in Canada as a society.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
There's a number of studies that suggest that the very presence of people with blended ideas in a society

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
seem to lead to greater acceptance between groups.

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It creates the sense that this is not an either or that we can coexist.

52
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Perhaps precisely because we have evidence that these cultures can coexist within a single person.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
For Julie, there's no contradiction in being a Canadian refugee speaking Czech,

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
or a Spanish-speaking immigrant who's a full-fledged or fully developed American.

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
These are not either or situations, cases where there is only a choice between two options with no third possibility.

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Instead, a peaceful coexistence can develop as shown in the life of Julie Sadevi herself.

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Right, it's time to reveal the answer to my question.

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
How many people around the world, like Julie, are living as displaced refugees?

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, I said it was 103 million. Was I right?

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And that was the correct answer, Rob, a number which according to the UN is only going to grow.

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Now it's time to recap the vocabulary we've learned from this programme about losing our mother tongue.

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The native language we were brought up speaking by our parents.

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
If something is dunked, it's dipped into a liquid, like a biscuit and a cup of tea.

64
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But if someone is dunked into a situation, they're suddenly placed into a new and unfamiliar setting.

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Before being removed again, after a short time.

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
If you have faith in something or someone, you have trust or confidence in them.

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The phrasal verb to sort itself out means to stop being a problem without having to do anything.

68
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The adjective full-fledged means completely developed.

69
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And finally, an either or is a situation where only a choice between two options is possible with no third alternative.

70
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And that brings us to the end of this programme. Bye for now.
