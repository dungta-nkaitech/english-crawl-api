00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,039
Hello, this is 6M8English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,320
And I'm Neil.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,280
There are a million songs about falling in love

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,400
and just as many about being broken-hearted.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,039
Do you remember the first time you fell in love, Sam?

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,320
Ah, yes. I was 14 and it seemed like every word of every love song

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,000
had been written just for me.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,119
There's a strong connection between music and love.

13
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:38,960
As Shakespeare famously wrote,

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,519
if music be the food of love, play on.

15
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,120
In this programme, we'll be meeting a singer-songwriter

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,879
who used music to express her feelings of falling in love

17
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,039
and later to mend her broken heart when the relationship ended.

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,879
And as usual, we'll be learning some new vocabulary as well.

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,880
But first, I have a question for you, Neil.

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,040
Your mention of Shakespeare reminds me of Romeo and Juliet,

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,520
his famous lovers who fall in love despite their fighting families

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,920
only to die tragically young.

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,159
But in which Italian city was Romeo and Juliet set?

24
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,200
Was it A, Florence, B, Venice, or C, Verona?

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,840
I think it must be one of the world's most romantic cities, Florence.

26
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,520
Okay, Neil, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

27
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,799
Julia Jacqueline is an Australian singer-songwriter

28
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,920
whose song don't know how to keep loving you,

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,200
reach number eight in the Australian pop charts.

30
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,400
Her song lyrics explore feelings of falling in love

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,120
as well as the pain of breaking up.

32
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,080
Julia's songs are written from experience.

33
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,879
Several years ago, she quit her band in Australia

34
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,879
and bought a one-way ticket to London

35
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,439
to be with her boyfriend and soulmate.

36
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,280
The person who she felt a special romantic connection with.

37
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,239
But things didn't work out as she'd hopes

38
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,840
and she found herself alone and working in a depressing job.

39
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,159
Julia turned to music,

40
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,800
pouring her feelings of lost love into the songs

41
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,560
which later became her first album as a successful musician.

42
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,680
So when BBC World Service programme the conversation spoke with her,

43
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,719
they asked Julia what she would tell her younger self.

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,840
The one thing that was just very heartbreaking for me at that age

45
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,560
was kind of adult cynicism, I guess, about love.

46
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,639
I found that really difficult.

47
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,719
You know, now when a young person is like really in love at 14,

48
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,479
I know that as an adult, all your instincts are telling them to like,

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,479
you know, that it's probably not going to work, you know?

50
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,639
And that's like just relax or whatever.

51
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,400
But I remember at the time just desperately wanting to be validated by adults

52
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,319
and not be told that I was being stupid.

53
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,920
I don't know, I'd probably just be like, yeah, go for it.

54
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,400
Many teenagers have a romantic ideal of everlasting love,

55
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,360
often in contrast to the beliefs of adults which Julia calls cynicism.

56
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,080
The belief that something will not be successful

57
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,879
or that the people involved are not sincere.

58
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,120
The young Julia wanted to feel validated to get confirmation

59
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,520
that her feelings were worthwhile and valued.

60
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,200
She wanted someone to tell her, go for it,

61
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,880
a phrase used to encourage a person to do whatever it takes

62
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,080
to make something work.

63
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,560
Young love is delicate and it's easy to be pessimistic.

64
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,879
I mean, how many couples do you know Sam

65
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,719
who met as teenagers and stayed together for the rest of their lives?

66
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,800
I don't know many, it's true.

67
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,560
Neuroscientist Dr Lucy Brown is co-creator of the Anatomy of Love,

68
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,000
a website exploring the science of romance.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,680
She thinks we need to be more realistic about falling in love

70
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,439
as she explains here to BBC World Services, the conversation.

71
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,759
I wish someone had said, you know, love is wonderful, yes, go for it,

72
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,080
but heartbreak happens, you know, and maybe this isn't going to last.

73
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,199
Maybe it is, but maybe it isn't and just realize that

74
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:13,439
it can be one of the most devastating experiences in your life,

75
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,120
but you're going to get over it.

76
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,319
Dr Brown thinks it's important to know that relationships can end in heartbreak,

77
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,319
feelings of great sadness as if your heart is broken,

78
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:26,720
especially after the end of a romantic affair.

79
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,800
But she also wants young people to know that whatever happens,

80
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,040
they can't get over it.

81
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,560
Feel better again after something has made them unhappy.

82
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,680
Falling in love is one of the great experiences in life

83
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,720
and developing the strength the face whatever happens

84
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,760
makes it more likely that the story ends happily,

85
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,480
unlike the tale of Romeo and Juliet.

86
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,920
I think it's time to reveal the answer to my question, Neil,

87
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,480
in which Italian city does the story of Romeo and Juliet take place?

88
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,120
I said it was Florence, so was I right?

89
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,400
Well, Florence is a romantic city, but the correct answer is Verona.

90
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,960
Verona was little known in Shakespeare's time,

91
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,920
but nowadays thousands of tourists visit the sites

92
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,360
connected with the story, including the famous balcony

93
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,920
where Romeo declared his eternal love.

94
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,319
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned starting with

95
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,680
soulmate, the special person who you feel a strong romantic bond to.

96
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,319
Sinicism describes the belief that something will not work out successfully.

97
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,040
If you are validated, you get external confirmation that your actions, ideas

98
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,600
or feelings are worthwhile and valued.

99
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,080
You can use the phrase go for it to encourage someone to make whatever efforts

100
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,560
are necessary to get something done.

101
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,520
Heartbreak describes feelings of great sadness

102
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,200
as if your heart is broken.

103
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,200
And finally, to get over something means to feel better again

104
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,439
after something has made you unhappy.

105
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,640
Once again, our six minutes are up, but there's time for one more famous saying

106
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:06,560
and I think it's good advice, better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.

107
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,920
Bye for now.

108
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,120
Goodbye.
