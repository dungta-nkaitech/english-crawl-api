Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,839
I'm Rob.

5
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:19,039
And I'm Georgina.

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,039
Now Georgina, you recently mentioned in one 6 Minute English program

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,240
about NFTs and that you had a collection of Pokemon cards when you were younger.

8
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:31,359
Yes, I did and I still can't find them.

9
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,560
Why did you bring that up?

10
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:40,560
Well, Pokemon started out as a video game series that turned into anime movies and trading cards

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,599
among other things. And in this program, we're talking about a video game character

12
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:49,840
that is iconic, a word which means widely known and recognised.

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,959
That character's name is Super Mario.

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,560
Ah, I spent many hours of my childhood playing with Nintendo's Super Mario

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,439
or his rival, Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,760
Now these days, video games are everywhere and people of all ages enjoy playing them.

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,079
There's also competitive e-sports events where gamers compete for what are often

18
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,680
considerable amounts of money.

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,240
Yes, and there are also streamers that appear on platforms like Twitch and YouTube

20
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,719
who have become celebrities in their own right.

21
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:31,599
Talking about celebrities, I have a question about the famous character we're talking about in

22
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:39,679
this program. Many people remember Super Mario brothers as being the first time we saw Mario,

23
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:48,000
but he first appeared in another game, which was it? Was it A, the legend of Zelda, B Donkey Kong

24
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,439
or C Pokemon?

25
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,480
I'm not sure about that. I can't remember him being in Pokemon, so I'll go for A, the legend

26
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,280
of Zelda. Okay, Georgina, we'll find out if you're right at the end of the program.

27
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,240
So, we established at the start of the program that these days, the video games industry is thriving.

28
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:16,159
True, but it wasn't always that way. It's hard to imagine now, but in the 1980s, the console market

29
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:18,639
was struggling, particularly in the US.

30
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,840
So bad that they ended up burying thousands of copies of it in a desert because nobody

31
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,400
liked it. So we'd had the, especially in America, this didn't happen so much in Europe,

32
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,840
but in America, there'd just been lots and lots of software and none of it was all that great.

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,719
There hadn't been anything really revolutionary in some years, so the video game boom was

34
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,159
really falling off the cliff and Nintendo is what rescued it in the US especially.

35
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:14,159
Kess and McDonald used the term a flood of, meaning a large number in a short period of time,

36
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:20,639
to describe the number of games that were coming out. She used cited, which means reference

37
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:26,719
or noted, when talking about the game ET being a reference for a factor in the collapse of the

38
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:35,280
console market. And she said boom, a sudden period of growth. So as ET was mentioned, as a factor

39
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,000
in the collapse, many people say that Super Mario Bros. was the reason that video games really took

40
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:48,719
off, especially in the US. It's interesting to consider what might have been if its creator,

41
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:56,159
Shiguru Miyamoto, had never created that character. The question is why is that game so popular?

42
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:02,800
What made it so fun to play? Here is Kess and McDonald speaking again with Peter White on the BBC

43
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:09,120
World Service program You and Yours. Explaining why Mario is just so popular and what makes the

44
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:16,000
original game so satisfying to play? It's just such a joy to play. It's running and jumping

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,560
and it's the joy of movement. When you play even the original Super Mario Bros. you just feel the

46
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,639
sense of joy in your movement. And it's one of the greatest games I've ever made. And a lot of

47
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,800
games from 35 years ago are basically unplayable now. They might have been a step to something

48
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,879
greater, but Mario is one of those few that really holds up today as well that did then.

49
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:43,120
Kess and McDonald said that some games from 35 years ago are unplayable, so not possible to play

50
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:50,000
them. But she said that Mario holds up, a term used to say that something standards or quality

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,319
has not lessened. It certainly does hold up. In fact, I played it the other day and I had lots of

52
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:01,199
fun with it. It reminded me of my childhood and it's still as good now as it was then.

53
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,439
Which reminds me of your quiz question, Rob? Yes. In my quiz question, I asked your Gina,

54
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:14,560
which game had the first appearance of that famous plumber, Mario? I went for A, the Legend of Zelda.

55
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:22,240
Ah, which is wrong, I'm afraid. Mario's first appearance was in Donkey Kong, and his creator,

56
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,919
Shiguru Miyamoto, never thought he would be that popular. Well, I guess we've already learnt

57
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,759
something today. Let's recap the vocabulary from today's programme about Super Mario, starting

58
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:41,520
with iconic, famously associated with something and instantly recognisable. Then we had a flood of,

59
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,920
which means a large amount of something in a short space of time. Sighted means reference as or

60
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:55,280
noted. Boom relates to explosion and means a short period of sudden growth. Unplayable describes

61
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:01,919
something that can't be played or a game that is very difficult to enjoy. And finally, holds up

62
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:08,559
means that the quality or standard of something hasn't changed and still looks good or plays well.

63
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:11,199
That's all for this programme. Bye for now. Bye!
