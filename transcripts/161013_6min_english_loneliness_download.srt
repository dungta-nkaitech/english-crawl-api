5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,439
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Sophie.

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:16,399
And I'm Neil.

7
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,080
How was your weekend, Neil?

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,640
Well, not great.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,000
I hadn't got anything planned,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,480
so I didn't see anyone for two days.

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,359
And to be honest, I felt very lonely.

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,719
There was a real physical feeling in the pit of my stomach.

13
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,039
Well, poor Neil, you do sound really down in the dumps,

14
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:36,320
and that means unhappy.

15
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:39,840
Well, the subject of today's show is loneliness.

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,239
And loneliness is sometimes described as a social pain,

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,879
a pain that tells us that we're isolated,

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,280
or lacking contact with others,

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,640
which motivates us to seek out companionship.

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,480
I had no idea that feeling lonely had a biological explanation.

21
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,839
How does being sociable help us as a species, then, Sophie?

22
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:02,000
It's all about cooperation,

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,799
or working together to get something done.

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,039
For example, finding food.

25
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:10,560
Oh, well, I suppose I cooperated with the Pizza Delivery guy

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,399
for a shared outcome.

27
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:14,719
You paid him and he gave you the pizza?

28
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:15,519
Exactly.

29
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,359
But it wasn't a socially enriching experience.

30
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:20,719
That's the bad thing about London.

31
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,199
You can feel lonely, even surrounded with people.

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,759
It isn't easy to meet people you really like,

33
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,880
so often you might as well just be on your own.

34
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,080
Good point.

35
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,520
And I have a question about cities and living alone, Neil,

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,800
because it's on the rise.

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,840
Which country has the highest proportion of people living on their own?

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,640
Is it A, the US, B, Japan, or C, Sweden?

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,640
Oh, well, I'm going to guess B, Japan.

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,600
Okay, we'll see if you've got that right later on in the show.

41
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,320
So, getting back to loneliness,

42
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,679
the idea is that because it makes us feel bad,

43
00:01:57,679 --> 00:02:00,399
it motivates us to go out and meet people.

44
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,839
Some people are more likely to feel lonely than others,

45
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:06,559
because our genes play a role in this tendency.

46
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,680
Hmm, I wonder if I inherited loneliness, genes.

47
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,680
I don't know, Neil.

48
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,039
But while in some situations being lonely may be a good thing,

49
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,439
because it encourages you to be sociable,

50
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,879
in other situations, it may be useful to tolerate,

51
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,039
or put up with loneliness.

52
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,319
Let's listen to Professor Dorit Bumsmer

53
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,759
at Vry University in Amsterdam talking about this.

54
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,759
So, the intriguing question is,

55
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,239
why do genes that influence loneliness still exist?

56
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,719
And one explanation is that probably they do not only have negative effects

57
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:52,719
in some situations, it is an advantage to be able to tolerate high levels of loneliness

58
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,960
and that is why the genes are maintained in the population.

59
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,719
So, inheriting genes for loneliness might not be a bad thing.

60
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,400
Why is that, Neil?

61
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,039
Because it means you can tolerate being alone for a long time without feeling bad.

62
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,879
Well, that's an intriguing or very interesting idea.

63
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,800
But it shows that you probably don't have those genes, Neil,

64
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,879
because you did feel bad at the weekend.

65
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,599
And actually, that was despite spending a lot of time on Facebook.

66
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,199
And that's a form of social contact.

67
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,000
But does all the tweeting, messaging, and chatting online that we do make us

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,680
lonelier because we're getting out less and meeting fewer people

69
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,800
or do virtual connections stop us from feeling lonely?

70
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:39,599
Those are intriguing questions.

71
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,159
Let's listen to Professor Eric Klinenberg,

72
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,879
sociologist at New York University, and author of a book about living alone.

73
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,000
He talks about this.

74
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,039
We just don't have great research showing that we are significantly more lonely

75
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,120
or isolated today than we were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago,

76
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,039
which means that critics who say that Facebook or the internet or whatever device

77
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,879
you carry with you is making you lonelier and more miserable.

78
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,039
They just don't have that much evidence to back it up.

79
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:16,800
So, there isn't enough evidence to back up or support the claim that social media

80
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,639
is making us feel lonelier.

81
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:19,680
No, that isn't.

82
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,959
Okay, now before I give you the answer to today's quiz question, Neil,

83
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,680
did you know that loneliness is contagious?

84
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,039
Oh, you mean you can catch it from someone like a cold?

85
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:35,120
Yes. There are environmental factors involved in loneliness too.

86
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,800
For example, if somebody you talk to every day is always unfriendly towards you,

87
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:46,639
this makes you statistically more likely to be negative in your interactions with somebody else.

88
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,319
Well, let's try and stay friendly towards each other then Sophie.

89
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,439
You can start by telling me whether I got today's quiz question right.

90
00:04:54,159 --> 00:05:00,319
Okay, I asked which country has the highest proportion of people living on their own?

91
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,759
Is it A, the US?

92
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,959
B, Japan or C, Sweden?

93
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,959
And I said Japan.

94
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,399
This is the wrong answer, I'm afraid.

95
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,279
It's actually C, Sweden.

96
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:18,719
Nearly half of all Swedish households are single occupancy or for one person.

97
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,439
Living alone in Sweden is arguably the norm because it's so easy.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,559
There are many affordable single occupancy apartments and young Swedes can expect to move into their own apartment

99
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:32,159
once they graduate high school.

100
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,159
Okay, now let's hear the words we learn today again, Sophie.

101
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:36,959
Yes, okay.

102
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,439
They are down in the dumps, loneliness,

103
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,600
isolated,

104
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,519
cooperation,

105
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,279
tolerate,

106
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,959
intriguing,

107
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,399
backup,

108
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,160
contagious,

109
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,399
single occupancy.
