00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,759
And I'm Beth. Can you keep a secret, Neil?

4
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,920
Or I use someone who spills the beans. That's an idiom meaning to tell people a secret.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,719
I'm pretty good at keeping secrets, Beth.

6
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,800
Unless it's giving away the ending of a movie, I'm always doing that.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,439
Whether you find it hard to keep secrets or take them with you to the grave,

8
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,200
keeping secrets is often considered something bad.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,200
But what if some secrets could actually make your life better?

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,320
Now, psychological studies are uncovering a more positive side to secrets,

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,679
suggesting that keeping good news to yourself can actually make you feel more alive,

12
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,000
especially if you plan to share your secret with someone later.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,159
In this programme, we'll be discussing the advantages of keeping secrets,

14
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,560
and, as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,159
But first, I have a question for you, Neil.

16
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:15,200
One very famous secret is the recipe for the world's favourite soft drink, Coca-Cola.

17
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:25,039
While travelling in Indonesia, BBC TV presenter Joanna Lumley believes she discovered the unknown secret ingredient.

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:33,680
So is Coca-Cola's secret spice A. Cinnamon B. Nutmeg or C. Ginger?

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,880
Well, I don't know, so I'm going to guess it's nutmeg.

20
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,240
Okay, I'll reveal the secrets at the end of the programme.

21
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,160
This year, a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology

22
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,080
introduced a new term to the discussion, positive secrets.

23
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:58,000
Here, the study's author, Dr. Michael Slepian of Columbia University,

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,799
discusses positive secrets with BBC World Service programme Newsday.

25
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:08,800
Yes, so what's interesting about the idea of positive secrets is, you know, there's a set of them

26
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,919
where the plan is to never reveal them. You know, we might say a guilty pleasure or something.

27
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,879
We enjoy it, but don't want to tell other people about.

28
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,199
And then there's other secrets that the whole point of keeping them secret is to reveal them.

29
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:27,599
You know, the surprising marriage proposal, the pregnancy announcement, unwrapping a gift that you've wrapped.

30
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:32,719
Dr. Slepian distinguishes between positive and negative secrets.

31
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:39,439
Negative secrets hurt people and damage relationships. They're like a guilty pleasure and activity

32
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,719
you really enjoy doing, but which also gives you a feeling of guilt or shame for doing it.

33
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:50,000
Positive secrets, on the other hand, include things like marriage proposals.

34
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,159
The act of asking someone to marry you. Revealing positive secrets lets us share and

35
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:02,639
celebrate those things with others. In fact, the whole point of positive secrets is to reveal them.

36
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,439
Here, the phrase, the whole point is used to mean the most important reason or purpose for something.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,400
Because positive secrets give us the feeling we are in control of our emotions, they energise us.

38
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,080
However, Dr. Slepian's research comes from the United States.

39
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,319
Would the results be the same in other cultures and countries?

40
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:29,759
Here's Dr. Slepian again, talking with BBC World Service Programme, Newsday.

41
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,640
Some cultures, it is said that if it's a good news, especially around pregnancy, don't share it

42
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,759
till the time, you know, it's safe because they feel that it may lead to some negative vibes.

43
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:50,079
Evil eye as many people call it. Is that also a part of what you found why people keep secret?

44
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:55,519
Are there any kind of cultural influences when they keep the good secrets and the positive secrets?

45
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,359
Yeah, it's interesting you bring this example because we're studying it right now.

46
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:07,759
We have this intuition that pregnancy and secrets around pregnancy in early periods

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,399
that it looks more like a burdensome secret and then when it's later and you know,

48
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:15,120
people feel comfortable discussing it more like positive secrets.

49
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:23,360
In some cultures, secrets about pregnancy are related to the evil eye, a superstition in which

50
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,639
someone causes injury or bad luck through a look. It could be bad luck to reveal a pregnancy to

51
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:38,560
early and Dr. Slepian calls these secrets burdensome, meaning worrying, troublesome or distressing.

52
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,959
It seems secrets do vary from culture to culture, but what everyone wants to know is the missing

53
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:50,800
ingredient in Coca-Cola. So come on Beth, tell us the secret answer to your question.

54
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:58,560
Okay, I asked about TV presenter, Joanna Lumley, who thinks she's found out Coca-Cola's secret

55
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,240
spicy ingredients. Well, I guess that it was nutmeg. And that was the correct answer! Good

56
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,800
guess, Neil. Traveling in Indonesia, Joanna noticed lots of nutmeg being grown and asked

57
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,759
who was buying it only to be told Coca-Cola. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from

58
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,199
this program starting with the idiom, spill the beans, meaning to reveal a secret.

59
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,920
A guilty pleasure is something you really enjoy doing, but which also gives you a feeling of guilt or shame.

60
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:38,000
A marriage proposal is the act of asking someone to marry you. The phrase, the whole point of

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,879
something, describes the most important reason or purpose for it. The evil eye is a superstition

62
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:51,919
in which someone causes injury or bad luck through a look. And finally, the adjective burdensome

63
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,680
means worrying, troublesome or distressing. Once again, our six minutes are up, but I'll

64
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,199
tell you a secret. You can join us again next time for more topical vocabulary here at six

65
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:11,039
minutes English. Goodbye for now. Bye!
