00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,719
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Neil.

5
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:17,679
And I'm Rob.

6
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:22,000
From the ancient Roman Sea God Neptune to myths of mermaids,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,800
to modern Hollywood films like Finding Nemo,

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,679
people throughout history have been fascinated by the idea of living underwater.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,200
In this programme, we'll be hearing about projects to create

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,119
livable underwater habitats and the challenges they face.

11
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,120
We'll be finding out how realistic it is to believe that in a few years,

12
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,320
we could be eating breakfast while watching fish swim outside the kitchen window

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,439
before heading off to work in an office under the ocean.

14
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,480
And we'll be learning some related vocabulary as well.

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,519
But first, it's time for our quiz question.

16
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:59,280
One of the first adventure stories to fire the public's imagination

17
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,960
about the underwater world was the 1870 novel,

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,280
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,079
But who wrote this underwater classic?

20
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:14,240
Was it A. H. G. Wells, B. Arthur Conan Doyle, or C. Jules Verne?

21
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:16,879
Oh, I think I know this one, Neil.

22
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,439
Wasn't it A. H. G. Wells?

23
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,240
OK, Rob. We'll find out later if you're right.

24
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,520
Now, one of the most ambitious designs for an underwater city is Ocean Spiral.

25
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,359
A huge transparent globe attached to the seabed,

26
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,640
the solid ground which lies deep below the sea level.

27
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,239
The top of the globe stands above the surface of the ocean,

28
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,959
and running through the center is a tower to add strength and to provide space

29
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:48,959
for homes, offices and even an amusement park for 5,000 underwater residents.

30
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,359
Ocean Spiral has been dreamt up by the Japanese Shimizu Corporation.

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,879
Here's Shimizu Engineer Max Saki Takuuchi,

32
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,400
explaining to BBC World Service Programme Crowd Science,

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,239
the motivation behind the idea.

34
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:12,079
At the moment, the world is facing a lot of serious problems regarding

35
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:16,240
food, energy, water, natural resources.

36
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,319
However, we are trying to solve these issues just by using our lands.

37
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,079
Our idea is to connect the sea surface and deep sea vertically,

38
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:35,280
and that way we believe that we can utilize the capability of the deep sea.

39
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,919
And that's the purpose of this whole project.

40
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,359
The effects of human activity on the land have led some to look to the oceans

41
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:48,639
for natural resources, naturally existing things,

42
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,079
such as minerals, oil, coal and other energy sources.

43
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,520
That can be used by people.

44
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,800
This search deep underwater is happening vertically,

45
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,400
at a 90-degree angle straight up or down from the ground,

46
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,320
as opposed to horizontally or flat across the earth's surface.

47
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,560
But as yet, Shimizu Corporation's plans for an underwater city

48
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,800
are still in the planning stages.

49
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,040
No part of the project has yet been built,

50
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,040
and the total cost is thought to exceed $26 billion.

51
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,920
In fact, the longest anyone has spent living under the sea is only 73 days.

52
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,679
That record was set by Roger Garcia, ex-military diver,

53
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:30,799
and head of the Aquarius, currently the world's only underwater research station.

54
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,599
Here's Roger Garcia explaining to BBC World Service Programme Crowd Science

55
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,359
what happens to the human body after living underwater for so long.

56
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,879
Perhaps a change in their voice.

57
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,879
Not much, because we're not very deep.

58
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,359
That's because the air becomes denser.

59
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:50,239
Physiologically, the most important thing, though,

60
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,640
is that since you are, in this case, at two and a half times atmospheric pressure,

61
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,600
you do take on more inner gaps.

62
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,480
And in this case, since the inside of the Aquarius, we just breathe normal air,

63
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,640
you're going to take on more nitrogen.

64
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,920
And depending on how long you stay in the Aquarius,

65
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,200
that's going to incur some sort of decompression obligation.

66
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,400
In addition to engineering challenges,

67
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,399
living underwater for long periods of time also affects the human body.

68
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,479
One example is the bends or decompression sickness,

69
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,039
a serious medical disorder created by nitrogen bubbles in the muscles

70
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:32,399
when returning to the surface of the sea too quickly.

71
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,039
The bends and changes to the voice are examples of how underwater living

72
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:43,359
changes the body physiologically, relating to how the bodies of living humans and animals function.

73
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,480
As divers descend deep below the ocean's surface,

74
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,520
there is an increase in atmospheric pressure,

75
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,240
the normal air pressure within the Earth's atmosphere.

76
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,960
The deeper they dive, the higher the pressure.

77
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,080
Physiological reactions like the bends are caused by divers incorrectly

78
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,040
readjusting to normal atmospheric pressure.

79
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,480
Well, Neil, with so many difficulties, it's no surprise that

80
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,520
H.G. Weld's fantasy of living under the sea is still science fiction.

81
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,879
Ah, but are you sure it was H.G. Weld's, Rob?

82
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,519
In my quiz question, I asked you who wrote the classic underwater adventure

83
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,919
20,000 leagues under the sea.

84
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,719
Yes, and I said A.H.G. Weld's.

85
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:27,120
Which was the wrong answer.

86
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,439
It was in fact C. Jules Verne, the French author, who also wrote around the world in 80 days.

87
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,120
In this programme, we've been discussing the challenge of living underwater,

88
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,199
going down vertically at a 90-degree angle to the sea bed,

89
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,000
the solid ground hundreds of meters under the sea.

90
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,759
Ocean explorers search underwater for natural resources,

91
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,240
useful materials like coal and oil.

92
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,039
But they face many physiological problems,

93
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,000
problems relating to how the human body functions,

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,199
such as the bends, a painful medical condition,

95
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,480
caused by returning too quickly to atmospheric pressure,

96
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,399
the Earth's usual air pressure.

97
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,680
That's all for this programme, but we hope you'll be diving back into

98
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,360
six-minute English very soon.

99
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,319
Bye for now.

100
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:10,959
Bye.
