00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,120
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,080
And I'm Sam.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,160
And if I say to you, Sam, motorbike, what do you think of?

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,960
Oh, I think of the film Easy Rider, with Jack Nicholson and Peter Fonda,

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,480
cruising the wide open spaces on powerful machines.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,359
How about you, Neil?

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,119
Oh, well, I think of the young man on a mo-ped who delivers my pizzas.

12
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,280
Not quite the same image, is it, really?

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,480
No, but in both cases, we were associating motorbikes with male figures.

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,719
Today, we're looking at women and bikes, but before that a quiz.

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,799
In which decade was the first mass-produced motorcycle released?

16
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:54,480
Was it A, the 1880s, B, the 1890s, or C, the 1900s?

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,760
What do you think, Sam?

18
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:56,960
Tricky question.

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,679
The 1880s, maybe too early.

20
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,519
So I think I'll play it safe and go for the middle option.

21
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:04,959
The 1890s.

22
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,319
Well, we'll see if you're right later in the programme.

23
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:13,680
Esperanza Miyake is the author of a new study of the gendered motorcycle

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,079
in film advertising and TV.

25
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,879
She was interviewed on BBC Radio's Thinking Allow programme about the topic.

26
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,879
First, she was asked about the experience of travelling at over 110

27
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:27,280
kilometres per hour on a motorbike.

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,959
What world does she say you are part of?

29
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,599
I think it dissolves, gender, race, all these things stop mattering.

30
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,599
It's all about experience to car drivers.

31
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,039
There's a lot about enjoying the internal space of the car.

32
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:45,359
And the bike, obviously, there's no interiority.

33
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,159
You're completely part of the exterior world.

34
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,919
So what world are you in when travelling at speed on a motorbike?

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,760
The external world.

36
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,400
Because you are not inside a car, your experience is completely different.

37
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,519
On a bike, you have no interiority.

38
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,560
That's the experience of being inside.

39
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,240
But I do have to say, although that is a real word,

40
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,039
it's not one I've ever heard or used before.

41
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,400
No, me neither.

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,680
What she also says is that travelling at speeds dissolves gender and race.

43
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,439
It makes them less important.

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,719
When you dissolve something, you make it less strong.

45
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,479
In fact, she says that it's speed these things stop mattering.

46
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,800
They stop having any importance.

47
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,159
If something doesn't matter, it's not important at all.

48
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:38,400
Before that, we said we usually connect motorbikes with men.

49
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,159
Think bike? Think bloke.

50
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,319
But what about women and bikes?

51
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,000
Esperanza Miyake goes on to talk about the way women bikers are usually shown in the media.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,719
How many different types does she mention?

53
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,680
Generally, there's three types.

54
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,120
The first type would be your typical empowered female who's on the motorbike.

55
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,759
You do have that image, but having said that, I would also add that those images are typically very sexualised, very stylised.

56
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,120
So yes, she's empowered, but she's in a skin type, cat suit.

57
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,599
You also get another type, which is the female rider, who's been muscularised.

58
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,960
She's kind of embodying very masculine kind of style.

59
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,320
And I think the third type is kind of silly, giggly female on a scooter.

60
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,400
So she talked about three types of representations, particularly in movies.

61
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,760
Sam tell us more.

62
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,360
Yes, she first talked about the empowered woman.

63
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,960
This is a character who has authority, who has the power to drive the plot and action,

64
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,480
and is not dependent on a man to make decisions for her.

65
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,640
It seems like a positive image,

66
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,000
but she does say that these characters are often sexualised,

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,719
that is, presented in a way that might be sexually appealing for a male audience.

68
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,799
The next character type she mentions is a woman who is very masculine.

69
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,359
They embody male characteristics, which means they have and demonstrate

70
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:08,239
many typically male personality features.

71
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,000
And the final type she talked about was showing women on bikes as silly and giggly riding scooters.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,879
So they don't seem to be many really completely positive images of women and motorcycles,

73
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,959
at least not in the popular media.

74
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:27,360
Time to look again at today's vocabulary, but first let's have the answer to the quiz question,

75
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,519
in which decade was the first mass-produced motorcycle released?

76
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:37,040
Was it A, the 1880s, B, the 1890s, or C, the 1900s?

77
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,560
What did you think, Sam?

78
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,199
I took a guess at the 1890s.

79
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,279
Well done, it was a good guess.

80
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:48,079
It was indeed the 1890s and a bonus point if you knew that it was 1894.

81
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,679
Okay, let's have a quick reminder of today's words.

82
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:54,000
We started with the verb dissolves.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,599
If something dissolves, it gets less strong, less immediate.

84
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:00,479
Then we had another verb to matter.

85
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,439
Something that matters is important to someone.

86
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:04,319
What's the next word?

87
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:11,839
It was a rather uncommon word to describe the experience of being inside, interiority.

88
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,839
Let's rush by that one and move on to the next word empowered.

89
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,359
Someone who is empowered is in control of their own life.

90
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:24,239
When we talk about empowered women, we are talking about women who are not dependent on men

91
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:27,279
or anyone else for the direction of their lives.

92
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,120
They make their own choices.

93
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,439
Our next word was sexualised.

94
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,120
This is when something is given a clearly sexual styling.

95
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,639
In the program we heard that women on motorcycles are often shown in a sexualised way,

96
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,399
dressed in clothing, for example, that makes them sexually attractive.

97
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,439
And finally, there was to embody.

98
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,039
This means to be a clear and obvious example of something.

99
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,680
So in movies, female bikers often embody male characteristics,

100
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,079
which means they might dress or behave in a way we would usually associate with men.

101
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,719
Well, it's time for us to say goodbye.

102
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,120
See you next time and until then, you can find us online and on our app.

103

Just search for BBC Learning English.

104
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,159
Goodbye for now.

105
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,800
Bye.
