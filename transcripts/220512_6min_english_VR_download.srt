Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Rob.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,960
And I'm Sam. Here at 6 Minute English, we love to chat about new technology.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,920
One of our favourite topics is VR or virtual reality,

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,480
and the ways that's shaping life in the future.

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,520
VR allows you to put on a headset and escape into a completely different world.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,800
In this programme, we'll be hearing about some of the ways VR is tackling serious problems,

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,960
like domestic violence and helping people overcome phobias,

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,680
the strong in a rational fear of something.

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,000
And of course, we'll be learning some useful, related vocabulary along the way.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,719
People who use VR often describe the experience as intense,

13
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,479
putting on the headset makes you feel you're really there in what's ever new world you've chosen.

14
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:10,719
And it's this intensity that inventives, scientists and therapists are using to help people overcome their problems.

15
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,879
We'll hear more soon, but first I have a question for you, Sam.

16
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,280
One of the phobias VR can help with is the fear of heights.

17
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,640
But what is the proper name for this psychological disorder?

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,200
Is the fear of heights called A,

19
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,480
electrophobia, B, arachnophobia or C, acrophobia?

20
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,200
I'll say A, electrophobia.

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,560
Okay, Sam, we'll find out the answer at the end of the programme.

22
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,799
Now, if, like me, you're not very good with heights,

23
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,640
you'll be happy to know that a company called Oxford VR

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,079
has designed a system to help with precisely that problem.

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,879
In the safety of your own home, you put on a headset and are guided through a series of tasks,

26
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:57,280
moving you higher and higher off the ground.

27
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,239
You start by taking an elevator to the top floor of tall buildings

28
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,920
and move on to harder challenges like climbing a rope.

29
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,359
Daniel Freeman is a professor of clinical psychology at Oxford University.

30
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:15,120
Listen as he explains how the VR experience works

31
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,639
to BBC World Service programme People Fixing the World.

32
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,000
Even though your consciousness is aware of assimilation,

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,159
it doesn't stop all your habitual reactions to heights happening

34
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,479
and that's really important and that's why it's got such a potential to be therapeutic.

35
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,080
The art of successful therapy and what you can do really, really well in VR

36
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,360
is enable someone to drop those defences and VR

37
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,560
a person is more able to drop them because they know there's no real height there.

38
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,400
Although the VR experience seems real,

39
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,080
the person using it knows it's only a simulation,

40
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,560
a pretend copy of the real thing.

41
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,960
This gives them confidence to go higher,

42
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,360
knowing they can't really get hurt.

43
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,039
But although it's simulated,

44
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:02,800
the experience is real enough to trick your mind into acting in its habitual way,

45
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,640
the way it usually typically works.

46
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,159
Although your brain knows you have both feet on the ground,

47
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,599
VR is so realistic that to complete the tasks you have to drop your defences,

48
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,560
a phrase meaning to relax and trust people by lowering the psychological barriers

49
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,719
you have built to protect yourself.

50
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,479
Oxford VR's fear of heights experience

51
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,840
uses VR to put people into another world,

52
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,000
but the next project we'll hear about takes things even further,

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,039
putting people into someone else's body.

54
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,520
In Barcelona, a VR simulation is being used in prisons

55
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,240
to make men convicted of domestic violence

56
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,400
aware of what it feels like to be in the position of their victims.

57
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,200
The project, called Virtual Embodiment,

58
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,040
is led by neuroscientist Mavi Sanchez Vivez

59
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,560
of Barcelona's Institute for Biomedical Research.

60
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,360
So in a virtual world, we can be somewhat different

61
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,879
and have a first person embodied perspective

62
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,280
from the point of view, for example, of a different person,

63
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,000
different gender, different AIDS.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,319
One can go through different situations

65
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,079
and have the experience from this totally novel perspective.

66
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,040
Many of the prisoners lack empathy for their victims.

67
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,000
Virtual embodiment works by giving these men the experience of abuse

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,319
in the first person, from the perspective of someone who actually experiences an event in person.

69
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,839
In VR, the men have the insults and abuse they gave to others, turn back on them.

70
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,360
It's a novel, a new and original experience for them,

71
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,199
and not a pleasant one either.

72
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,680
But the VR therapy seems to be working,

73
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,360
and Dr Sanchez Vivez reports more and more of the prisoners

74
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,560
successfully reintegrating into their communities

75
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,240
after their release from prison.

76
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,120
The experience VR creates of seeing things from someone else's point of view

77
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,560
can be therapeutic, even for serious problems.

78
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,800
And speaking of problems, what was the answer to your question, Rob?

79
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,960
Ah, I asked Sam whether the correct name for the fear of heights

80
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,520
was electrophobia, arachnophobia, or acrophobia.

81
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,160
I guessed it was electrophobia.

82
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,319
Which was the wrong answer?

83
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:24,879
electrophobia is the fear of chickens.

84
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,800
The correct answer was see acrophobia, a fear of heights,

85
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,560
and a good example of a phobia.

86
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,319
Hmm, let's recap the rest of the vocabulary we've learned

87
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,480
starting with simulation,

88
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,080
a pretend copy of something that looks real, but is not.

89
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,920
Her bitual describes the usual typical way something works.

90
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,840
The phrase drop your defenses, means to relax,

91
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,759
and trust something by lowering your psychological barriers.

92
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,480
In the first person, means talking about something from the perspective of the person

93
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,120
who actually experienced an event themselves.

94
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,759
And finally, the adjective novel means completely new and original,

95
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,000
unlike anything that's happened before.

96
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,920
Ah, well once again, our six minutes are really and virtually over.

97
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,800
Goodbye for now.

98
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,600
Bye.
