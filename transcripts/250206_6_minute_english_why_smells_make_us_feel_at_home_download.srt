00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,080
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Phil.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,759
And I'm Beth. Phil, what makes home special for you?

4
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:22,480
Maybe it's sleeping in your own bed, the view from the window or a loved family pet?

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,280
What makes you feel like your home, Phil?

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,679
You know what? I think it's just relaxing on my sofa in my living room.

7
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:34,079
Very nice. Well, you might not realise it, but for your brain,

8
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,119
one of the strongest identifiers of home is smell.

9
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,399
Listen, as BBC presenters, Marnie Chesterton and Tristan Arton

10
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,000
describe the smells, which give them the feeling of home.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,200
My granddad's house smells of pine and damp and musty books.

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,640
I know my mom's perfume, my dad's preferred soap.

13
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,160
In this programme, we'll be finding out why our sense of smell is so important to

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,520
feeling at home, even when we don't notice it.

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,599
As always, we'll be introducing some useful new vocabulary.

16
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,840
And if you head over to our website, BBCLearningEnglish.com,

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,760
you'll find a transcript of the programme to read along with as you listen.

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,680
And there's a free worksheet too.

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,680
Good idea, Beth. But now it's time for my question.

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,560
The sense of smell is incredibly powerful, but not everyone has it.

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,400
A small amount of the population is a nozzmick, meaning they can't smell.

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,480
So, according to research at the University of Reading,

23
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,320
what percentage of people have no sense of smell?

24
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,680
Is it a 2% b 5% or c 7%?

25
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,719
Oh, I'm going to say b 5%.

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,760
Well, we'll find out the correct answer later in the programme.

27
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,000
Have you ever come back home from holiday and noticed a strange smell in your house?

28
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,760
If you have, don't worry, it's not bad.

29
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,639
In fact, there's a scientific reason for it.

30
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,319
As science writer Tristan Arthone explained to BBC World Service programme,

31
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,680
unexpected elements.

32
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,200
One thing I've been thinking about is that every house or home has a smell to it.

33
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,960
You might really notice this in your own home when you come back from a long trip,

34
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,760
and you step through your front door and think smell just kind of a bit weird.

35
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,600
While there's a good chance your house might smell strange because it's been closed up for a few

36
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,600
weeks, there's also a chance you might be smelling your home as it usually smells,

37
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,319
but you just don't notice it when you're there.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,680
Tristan says that when you return home after being away, there's a good chance your house

39
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,000
smells weird, an adjective meaning strange or unusual.

40
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,120
If you say there's a good chance that something will happen, you mean there's a high

41
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,520
likelihood or probability of it.

42
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,640
The truth is that every home has a smell, although we're so used to it, we usually don't notice.

43
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:16,399
When we breathe in, receptor cells in the nose detect molecules in the air and send them to

44
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:23,119
old factory organs in the brain. These analyse the smells for danger. The reason you can't smell

45
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:29,919
your own home is that it isn't a threat to you. Here's Science writer Tristan Arthone again,

46
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,879
explaining more to BBC World Service programme, unexpected elements.

47
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,479
By filtering out common non-threatening smells, it makes it easier to detect things out of the

48
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:48,240
ordinary. That might be dangerous. For example, if you forget about your toast and it starts to burn,

49
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,479
you can typically smell that quickly because it's a change to the environment that you're in,

50
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:57,120
then the other parts of your brain kick in to understand the smell of smoke as a potential

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,319
harm or threat. But even if we can't smell our own homes, the scent of them still matters because

52
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,759
it's entangled with our recognition of comfort and security.

53
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:12,639
By filtering out familiar smells, our brains are able to detect other smells which are out of the

54
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:20,159
ordinary, unusual or uncommon, and which may be dangerous. To filter something out means to remove

55
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:26,240
or separate something unwanted from something else. For example, filtering out the smell of home

56
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,079
means we notice the smell of burning toast or other smells alerting us to possible danger.

57
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,920
Even though we don't usually notice the scent, the particular smell of our home,

58
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,240
it still has an effect on the brain's limbic system, which handles memory and emotion.

59
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,159
This explains why smell has such a strong effect on our feelings and why we feel comfortable

60
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:55,199
and safe at home. Right, Phil, isn't it time to reveal the answer to your question?

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,839
Yes, it is. I asked you what percentage of the population is anosmic, that means they can't smell.

62
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:09,680
And the answer is B, 5%, which is what you said, I think. It is, yeah. Well done.

63
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,360
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt in this programme, starting with anosmic,

64
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:23,839
meaning having no sense or a limited sense of smell. The adjective weird means strange, odd, or bizarre.

65
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:30,319
When someone says there's a good chance something will happen, they mean it's quite likely to happen.

66
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:36,079
The phrase out of the ordinary means unusual, uncommon, or exceptional.

67
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,399
If you filter something out, you remove or separate something unwanted from a substance.

68
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:48,319
And finally, a scent is a distinctive smell, often a pleasant one,

69
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:54,159
although it can also mean the smell made by an animal. Once again, our six minutes are up,

70
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:58,879
but if you enjoyed listening to this programme, you'll find many more, along with a worksheet

71
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:05,040
with a quiz you can try on our website, BBCLearningEnglish.com. See you there soon.

72
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,360
Bye!
