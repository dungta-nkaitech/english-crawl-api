00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,040
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,160
And I'm Neil. Could you lend me some Dosh Neil?

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,679
Sure, how much do you need?

7
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:21,839
A couple of smackers.

8
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,679
You'll send you a bit strange today, Alice.

9
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,760
Yes, I know, Neil.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,440
Slang or informal language used by a particular group

11
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,760
is the subject of today's show.

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,160
And I was just demonstrating a couple of slang words that mean money.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,000
Dosh is a general term for money, and a smacker is a British pound or US dollar.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,680
Okay, so Cockney rhyming slang is a type of slang.

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,000
It's a coded language invented in the 19th century by Cockneys.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,480
So they could speak in front of the police without being understood.

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,920
And still on the subject of money, I have a question for you, Alice.

18
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,960
Oh, okay.

19
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,320
What's Cockney rhyming slang for money?

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,879
Is it a bread, b honey or c-dough?

21
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:09,280
I think it's a bread.

22
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,519
I bet you didn't know Neil that I'm a Cockney.

23
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,400
I don't add a manoeuvre, Alice. That's a pork pie.

24
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,120
Adam and Eve means believe and pork pie means lie.

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,079
Actually, you're right. I'm not a Cockney.

26
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,640
To be considered a Cockney, you need to be born

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,239
within hearing distance of the bells of St Mary Lebo Church

28
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,239
in what is now the city of London.

29
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:38,640
Indeed. Now slang, as we've said, is colloquial or informal language

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,920
and it's characteristic of specific social groups.

31
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,719
We usually use it in informal conversation

32
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,200
rather than in writing or more formal situations like a job interview.

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,560
We change the way we speak so that what we say is appropriate

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,319
for a particular situation.

35
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,279
So you surprised me earlier, Alice, by talking about

36
00:01:57,279 --> 00:02:00,559
Dosh and smackers because it didn't seem appropriate

37
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:02,079
for presenting the show.

38
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,479
Slang use is often frowned upon or disapproved of.

39
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,079
Let's listen to Jonathan Green, a lexicographer of slang,

40
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:13,680
talking about who uses slang and how this has changed.

41
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,479
Here he is on the Radio 4 programme Word of Mouth.

42
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,280
Slang does have a bad reputation and I would say this comes

43
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,960
from its earliest collection which was of criminal slang

44
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,240
in the 1500s in the 16th century and it was associated with bad people

45
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,800
and inevitably that has lingered.

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,360
But now in the last 40-50 years it's changed the definitions

47
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,240
tend to stress different and jocular, funny, humorous,

48
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,840
inventive that kind of thing.

49
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,759
So we have records of 16th century slang in collections or dictionaries.

50
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,560
Words used by criminals as a code so they could talk without being understood

51
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,639
and this bad reputation has lingered or been slow to disappear.

52
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,759
But for the last 50 years we've been using slang to be funny and creative

53
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,479
as well as to show belonging to a particular group

54
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:12,079
and apparently we're very creative when talking about drinking and being drunk.

55
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:18,399
The slang word booze meaning alcohol comes from the 13th century Dutch word

56
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,080
and there are hundreds of slang expressions to talk about drink and being drunk

57
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,040
on the source in your cups half-cut hammered, squiffy tipsy, wasted,

58
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,920
legless and many many more that are far too rude to mention in this programme.

59
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,120
Yes. So while these terms might not be strictly acceptable

60
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,120
or appropriate in formal context they aren't offensive,

61
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,879
they are often amusing and help people bond in social groups.

62
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:53,599
By contrast, swear words or profanity means rude language that offends or upsets people

63
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,159
and I'm not going to give any examples because that would be inappropriate and impolite, Alice.

64
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,359
Okay, let's listen now to Jonathan Green and presenter Michael Rosen

65
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:07,280
talking about jargon, another type of in-group language.

66
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,280
jargon what I would call is small-o occupational small-p professional slang it's closed off

67
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,079
environment. You get legal jargon, you get a naval jargon I've been reading and

68
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,439
Patrick O'Brien recently and that's a wash with butter plates and fidying the day.

69
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:31,360
This is radio four Jonathan, be careful. Jonathan Green in another segment of the BBC Radio Four

70
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,600
programme word of mouth. So he says jargon is occupational and professional meaning people speak

71
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,720
at work for example lawyers and sailors. A futter plate is I believe an iron plate

72
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,280
attached to the top of a ship's mast but I don't know much about this subject.

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,520
That's the idea though jargon is the technical language belonging to a specific group

74
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,760
and to outsiders this jargon is often hard to understand.

75
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,480
Yes and here in the studio I can use all the radio jargon that I liked look at my

76
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:10,480
faders here Alice going down up and up and up and I'm just testing our levels.

77
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,480
Come on leave the fader alone it controls the level of sound on a studio deck.

78
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,240
Now it's time for the answer to today's quiz question Neil.

79
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,280
I asked you what's Cockney rhyming slang for money? Is it A, bread, B, honey or C, dough?

80
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,439
And I said A, bread.

81
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:35,199
In you were right Alice Cockney rhyming slang uses just the first word of a phrase that rhymes

82
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:43,279
with the word we're trying to disguise. So money becomes bread and honey but we just say bread.

83
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:48,639
Okay so let's recap on the words we've learnt today. They are slang,

84
00:05:49,199 --> 00:06:04,399
Dosh, smacker, Cockney rhyming slang, colloquial, frowned upon, lingered, booze, swear, profanity, jargon.

85
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,479
Well that's the end of today's 6 Minute English please join us again soon.

86
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,680
Bye bye.
