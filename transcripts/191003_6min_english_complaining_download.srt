00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,120
Hello, this is 6 Minute English, I'm Sam.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,080
And I'm Rob.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,559
Are you good at complaining, Rob?

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,519
Of course not, I'm British.

9
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,480
I never complain, even when I get terrible service,

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,160
it's just too embarrassing.

11
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:29,920
Well, you might be in a minority now,

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,759
as it seems we British are complaining more than we used to.

13
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:37,920
We'll look at this topic a little more after this week's quiz question.

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,960
The oldest recorded complaint is on a stone tablet in the British Museum.

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,200
It's nearly 4,000 years old.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,159
What was the complaint about?

17
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:54,000
A, an incorrect number of goats that were delivered after being bought at market.

18
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,759
B, the quality of copper bars that were supplied.

19
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,640
Or C, the non-payment of a bill for a banquet.

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,679
What do you think, Rob?

21
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:05,840
I'm just going to guess at the goats.

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,879
Someone bought a load of goats and fewer were delivered than were bought.

23
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,799
That sounds good, but it's just a guess.

24
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,439
Mm-hmm.

25
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,039
Okay, well, I will reveal the answer later in the programme,

26
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:19,519
and don't complain if you get it wrong.

27
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:25,119
You and yours is a BBC Radio programme about consumer affairs.

28
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,599
On a recent programme, they discuss the topic of complaining and customer service,

29
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:35,039
with Giles Hawke, from an organisation called the Institute of Customer Service.

30
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:37,120
He talks about different sectors.

31
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,640
A sector is a particular area of business.

32
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,439
Which sectors does he say have most problems when it comes to keeping the complaining

33
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,799
customers satisfied?

34
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,480
The sectors that probably have more problems in the UK average

35
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,759
are public services, telecommunications, transport and service sector.

36
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,719
And they're probably some inherent challenges within those sectors.

37
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,280
They maybe have more impact on a day-to-day basis.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,599
Those sectors which are performing well, travel is performing well, retail is performing well,

39
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,120
leisure appears to be performing well.

40
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:18,000
So, which sectors are not keeping the customer satisfied?

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,039
He says that public services, telecoms, transport and the service sector have most problems.

42
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:29,840
And he says that these sectors may have inherent challenges.

43
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,840
And what does he mean by that?

44
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,920
Well, some sectors by their nature are more complicated and more likely to cause problems for customers.

45
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:43,599
Public services, for example, often don't have enough money or enough staff.

46
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,039
Telecommunication systems, such as your internet connection, are very complicated and sometimes

47
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,719
go wrong. And bad weather can affect transport and so on.

48
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,599
So, an inherent problem is a problem that is part of the nature of the thing itself.

49
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:01,359
So, those sectors are not performing well.

50
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:07,039
We usually think of the word perform when we're talking about actors or musicians.

51
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:14,000
But in a business sense, to perform well or badly means to be successful or not.

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,560
And according to Giles Hawke, travel and retail are performing well in terms of customer service.

53
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,079
Giles Hawke goes on to talk about how people are actually making their complaints,

54
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:30,959
but are modern methods taking over from the traditional letter or phone call?

55
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,480
We still see over 58% of complaints are made by phone or by letter.

56
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,280
So, you know, the more traditional methods of making a complaint are still dominant.

57
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,480
But we are seeing social media rise, although it's still a very small part of how people complain.

58
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,200
And it tends to be used as an escalation point of people aren't getting what they want

59
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,560
dealt within the first instance.

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,680
So, are people using modern methods more than traditional ones?

61
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,680
Actually, no. He says that phoning or writing a letter are still dominant.

62
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,640
This means they are still the main most-used methods for making a complaint.

63
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,599
Where people are turning to social media is if their complaint is not dealt with.

64
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,399
To deal with something means to sort it, to fix it.

65
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,800
And if you complain and it's not dealt with, then he says,

66
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,399
people turn to social media as a form of escalation.

67
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,239
When you escalate a complaint, you take it to a higher level.

68
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:36,639
Putting your complaint on social media means that a lot more people are going to see it,

69
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,239
and it might encourage a company to deal with the complaint.

70
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:45,599
Right, well, before we receive any complaints, let's review today's vocabulary

71
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:50,399
after the answer to the question, which was about a 4,000 year old complaint.

72
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:56,959
Was the complaint about A, an incorrect number of goats that were delivered after being

73
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,759
bought at market? B, the quality of copper bars that were supplied,

74
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:07,359
or C, the non-payment of a bill for a banquet. Rob, what did you say?

75
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:09,759
I went for A, I went for the goats.

76
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:16,959
Sorry, it was actually a complaint about the quality of copper ingots or bars that were supplied.

77
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,639
If you knew that, very well done. If you guessed right, also very well done.

78
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,639
No shame to get that one wrong.

79
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,000
No complaints from me.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,959
Mm-hmm. Right, now to vocabulary.

81
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:34,000
We had sectors which are particular areas of business in the economy.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,680
Something that is inherent is a natural part of something.

83
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,039
It's usually used to describe a problem or risk that is an unavoidable part of something.

84
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,839
How successful a company is can be described as how well it's performing.

85
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:52,560
And if something is dominant, it means it is the strongest or most used.

86
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,480
And if a company doesn't deal with or try to fix a problem,

87
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,480
the customer might take the complaint to the next level on social media,

88
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,800
which would mean an escalation.

89
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,120
Thank you, Rob. That's all from six minute English.

90
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,279
This time do join us again soon and don't forget to check us out online.

91
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,240
Bye-bye. Bye.
