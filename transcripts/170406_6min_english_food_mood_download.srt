00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,919
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English,

6
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:15,759
the show that brings you an interesting topic,

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,240
authentic listening practice and six items

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,320
of incredibly useful vocabulary.

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,080
I'm Dan and I'm Neil.

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,920
Now, a favourite topic today.

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,879
Food and how food could influence your mood.

12
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:30,000
Dan, tell me, what food makes you happy?

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, you know, ice cream, chocolate.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,399
Chocolate always puts a smile on my face.

15
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,479
And a few inches around your waistline.

16
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:39,519
Sadly, the research we'll be looking at today

17
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:41,759
doesn't suggest you eat more chocolate,

18
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:43,840
but it does talk about bacteria.

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,799
Bacteria.

20
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,879
Those simple, small organisms.

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:47,840
They make me happy.

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,640
Absolutely.

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,560
The so-called good bacteria do.

24
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,640
We'll get to that, but first we'll look at today's question.

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,759
How many bacteria are there in the human body?

26
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:04,799
Is it A39 million, B39 billion, or C39 trillion?

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,840
Hmm.

28
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,280
They are pretty small.

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,680
I'm going to go for C39 trillion.

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,920
Well, we'll find out if you're right

31
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,680
by counting them one by one.

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,920
That's going to take longer than six minutes.

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes, it is. So let's get moving.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,079
Scientists believe your mental state

35
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,960
is connected to the bacteria in your gut.

36
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:25,359
My gut, my stomach, and the other organs

37
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:26,719
my food passes through.

38
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,039
Yes, researchers at McMaster University

39
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,119
and Canada and University College

40
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,239
cork in Ireland have found that certain bacteria

41
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:36,559
help produce anxiety in mice.

42
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:37,359
Anxiety.

43
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,599
The state of being worried or anxious.

44
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,519
I don't like the sound of an anxious mouse.

45
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,039
Well, I'm afraid there's another mouse experiment coming up.

46
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,919
Researchers at Kyushu University found

47
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:50,879
germ-free mice showed more stress.

48
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,399
Germs. A general word for bacteria and microorganisms.

49
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,959
Usually the ones which cause disease.

50
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,799
So germs help reduce stress and anxiety in mice.

51
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,280
Hmm. Any research on humans?

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,599
The BBC TV program Trust Me.

53
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,240
I'm a doctor has just explored this.

54
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,359
They looked at foods which are high in good bacteria.

55
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:13,680
The claim which more and more food products

56
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,960
are making these days.

57
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,759
Yes, it's a phrase that appears a lot in marketing.

58
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,840
But many traditional foods are high in good bacteria as well.

59
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,639
They found that homemade fermented food was best.

60
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,239
So things like miso soup, kimchi, yogurt, sourcrow,

61
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,599
all these are fermented.

62
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,799
Have you tried all of those?

63
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:33,280
Mmm, I love miso soup and kimchi.

64
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,120
And fermentation is the process where sugars in food are turned into acids and alcohol.

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,479
Femented foods are full of lots of good bacteria for your gut.

66
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,159
Anything else from the BBC program?

67
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,799
Well, this is the man behind the BBC study.

68
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,000
Dr. Michael Mosley in this clip, a radio presenter,

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,680
asks him about the best kind of food to make us happy.

70
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,680
What's the good mood food?

71
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,840
What shall we eat now to cheer ourselves up?

72
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,560
Mediterranean diet, olive oil,

73
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,320
oily fish full of omega-3, which is really good for the brain,

74
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,040
whole grains, fruit vegetables, sugar, terrible food.

75
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,320
Not chocolate or clairs.

76
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,400
Sadly not, that would make you feel good.

77
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,320
Dark sugar, good for about 30 seconds.

78
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,960
It's actually finishing.

79
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,640
Then you feel terribly, terribly guilty.

80
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,080
Right. Okay, Mediterranean.

81
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,840
He said the best kind of food is the Mediterranean diet.

82
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,760
Now, a diet can mean an eating plan designed to help you lose weight.

83
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,840
But that's not what it means here.

84
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,439
Here it refers to the food and drink eaten by a group of people.

85
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,720
In this case, the people living around the Mediterranean see.

86
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,400
Lots of oily fish, olive oil, grains, fruits and vegetables.

87
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,840
And of course, add in plenty of fermented food too.

88
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,680
And don't eat too many fatty sugary chocolatey things,

89
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,520
like chocolate or clairs.

90
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,480
Those buns filled with cream and covered in chocolate,

91
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,640
it's really not rocket science, is it?

92
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,320
Eating healthy is pretty straightforward,

93
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,320
even if the science behind it is complex.

94
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,480
When you say something is not rocket science,

95
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,719
you mean it's not difficult to understand.

96
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,719
Now, are you ready for some counting?

97
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,360
Ah, yes.

98
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,320
You wanted me to count all the bacteria in my body.

99
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,920
I said 39 trillion.

100
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,920
And you were right.

101
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,480
Woo-hoo!

102
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,080
The number goes up and down,

103
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,000
but on average, we're thought to have

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,079
around 39 trillion bacterial cells in the body,

105
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,959
according to the Weisman Institute in Israel.

106
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,720
The interesting thing is they think

107
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,079
that there are only 30 trillion human cells in the body.

108
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,040
So there's more bacteria than human in me?

109
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,199
Well, maybe just you, Dan.

110
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,920
Now, before the bacteria take over completely,

111
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,720
let's look over today's words one more time.

112
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,920
Gut was first.

113
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,120
It means the stomach and other organs which digest our food.

114
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,639
But here's an extra tip.

115
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:44,319
The word can also mean bravery when used in the plural.

116
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,519
You've got guts, Neil, wearing that crazy shirt in this office.

117
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,639
Well, thank you.

118
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,839
Maybe I don't feel any anxiety about how I look.

119
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,680
Anxiety was our second word,

120
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,599
and it means fear or worry.

121
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:57,279
The adjective is anxious.

122
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:58,800
You know what makes me anxious?

123
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,599
Germs.

124
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,680
I washed my hands 50 times a day.

125
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,519
I can't stand the idea of getting ill

126
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,719
from all the germs around here.

127
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:07,279
Yes, germs are tiny organisms.

128
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,560
The word usually refers to those which carry disease.

129
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,879
But as we heard, certain germs are good for you.

130
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,280
Especially those which are in fermented food.

131
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,360
That's food which has gone through a process

132
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,160
where sugars turn into acids and alcohol.

133
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,560
They often taste sour or bitter.

134
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,759
We also talk about fermenting alcoholic drinks.

135
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,920
Beer and wine are fermented.

136
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,560
Does that mean I should make them a part of my diet?

137
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,959
A diet not only means a healthy eating plan,

138
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,759
but can also mean the foods and drinks consumed

139
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,680
by an individual or group.

140
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,680
Which country has the best diet, Neil?

141
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,800
Well, in my opinion, the Japanese diet.

142
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,920
It's my favorite anyway.

143
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,480
Very varied and plenty of fermented food.

144
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,120
And finally, we had it's not rocket science.

145
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,639
It's simple to understand.

146
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,519
An example?

147
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,519
Brewing beer isn't rocket science.

148
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,319
You just need hops, yeast, and patience.

149
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,519
And there we are, a rocket speed review of today's words.

150
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,680
