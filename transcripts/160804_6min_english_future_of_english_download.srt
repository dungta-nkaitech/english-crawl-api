3
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:14,400
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,839
And I'm Neil. So, Alice, can you think of an example of how the English we speak is changing?

5
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:23,679
Yes, I can. Teenagers saying like all the time.

6
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:25,679
Oh, that's like really like annoying.

7
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,440
Yeah, like. Yeah, like.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,039
Well, the subject of today's show is how and why the English language is changing.

9
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:39,439
And teenagers definitely have their own code, including text speak when they're on the internet or using their phones.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:48,159
FOMO, FOMO, B-B-A-E, PLOS, PLOS. Do you have any idea what those terms mean?

11
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:54,799
I've got no idea what you're talking about, Alice. They're pretty baffling and that means hard to understand.

12
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,640
But that's the idea, isn't it? We oldies aren't supposed to understand.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:06,799
Yes, exactly. Apparently, PLOS means parents looking over shoulder, which proves your point.

14
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,039
Text speak is a lot to do with inventing cool new terms and these change quickly.

15
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:18,560
In a year or even six months' time, words that were once popular have disappeared completely.

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,400
Okay, I have a quiz question forming in my mind, Alice. So, I hope you're feeling up to the challenge.

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:33,520
Can you tell me what kinds of words are slow to change? Is it A? Nouns, B, pronouns or C adjectives?

18
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,840
I think it's A, nouns. The way we name things probably doesn't change that quickly.

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,240
We shall find out if you're right or wrong later on in the show, but let's think about English grammar for a minute.

20
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,400
What changes are occurring here?

21
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,680
I noticed you said shall, there, Neil. And to my ear, that sounds pretty old-fashioned.

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,360
And you're right, Alice. The modal verb shall is on the way out, meaning it's disappearing.

23
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,640
Why do you think that is?

24
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,400
Well, perhaps it's because Will sounds more natural these days.

25
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,719
Let's listen to linguist basarts talking to writer and presenter Michael Rosen on the BBC Radio 4 program

26
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,800
Word of Mouth for his explanation.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,960
Why would we lose shall? I mean, if especially as we hold it in the interrogative, we say,

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,240
you know, shall we go swimming?

29
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,600
Well, because it's in competition with Will, if you have two words that more or less express the same meaning,

30
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,159
one of the two is going to be pushed out of the language. And in this case, it shall.

31
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,040
Basarts there. And interrogative means a question.

32
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,680
So it's not just in nature that we get survival of a fittest, you know, the struggle for life.

33
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,640
It happens in language too. Similar words are competing with each other and some lose,

34
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,280
while others win out or succeed after a fight.

35
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,280
Do you know of any other modal verbs that are on their way out, Alice?

36
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,080
Yes, must is declining rapidly.

37
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,039
And why is that?

38
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:01,920
Well, must sounds authoritarian and people are choosing to express obligation or having a duty to do

39
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
something in different ways.

40
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,159
Okay, authoritarian means demanding that people obey you. For example,

41
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,639
Alice, you must move on to the next point now.

42
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,800
Oh, you scared me a bit, Daniel.

43
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,680
Exactly. I can see why people are showing away from or avoiding must.

44
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,280
It sounds nicer to soften obligation by saying things like,

45
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,320
you might want to move on to the next point now, Alice.

46
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay, then, I shall.

47
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,800
Let's talk about tenses. Progressive tenses formed from the verb B and the suffix

48
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:41,360
in are usually used for ongoing situations. For example, I'm doing the show with Neil at the moment.

49
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,040
But its use has been increasing rapidly.

50
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,400
Let's listen to Michael Rosen and Bassart's again talking about this.

51
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,400
It started increasing dramatically in the 19th century and has continued to rise in the present day.

52
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,640
I think that's a cue for me to say I'm loving it.

53
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,080
Right. Well, that is one of the constructions that is coming in.

54
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,480
I mean, I sometimes call it the big Mac progressive because of course, McDonald's used that.

55
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,280
In this segment of the BBC Radio 4 program word of mouth,

56
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,199
Michael Rosen quotes the progressive form, I'm loving it.

57
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,680
A slogan used by an American fast food chain in its advertising campaign.

58
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,920
The verb love is a state verb. It expresses a state of being as opposed to doing

59
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,319
and is traditionally used in the simple form. For example, I love it.

60
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,879
But these days, people are using state verbs in the progressive more and more.

61
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,040
I'm hearing what you're saying, Alice.

62
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,719
Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question.

63
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:44,000
I asked you what kinds of words are slow to change?

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,839
Is it A nouns, B pronouns or C adjectives?

65
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:50,240
And I said A nouns.

66
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,040
And you were wrong, Alice.

67
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:59,040
According to Professor Mark Pagel, evolutionary biologist at Reading University in the UK,

68
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,879
pronouns like I and you and we evolve slowly.

69
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:07,680
A thousand years ago, we would be using similar or sometimes identical sounds.

70
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,560
Similarly, number words evolved very slowly.

71
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,439
Our ancestors were using related sounds a thousand or perhaps even two thousand years ago.

72
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,600
Whereas nouns and adjectives get replaced quite rapidly.

73
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,800
And in 500 years or so, we'll probably be using different words to the ones we use now.

74
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,439
Well, I got that completely wrong then.

75
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,480
Who knew that one, two, three would have such staying power?

76
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,560
I suppose numbers are pretty fundamental to our day-to-day lives, sort of part of who we are.

77
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,640
Okay, let's hear the hopefully more permanent words we learned today.

78
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,600
They were baffling on the way out.

79
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,040
Interrogative.

80
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,480
Win out.

81
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,920
Obligation.

82
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,920
Authoritarian.

83
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,240
Shying away from.

84
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,920
Progressive.

85
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,840
Stative.

86
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:59,359
Well, that's the end of today's six-minute English.

87
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,079
To recap, we're enjoying the progressive tense.

88
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,319
And we're loving will and should but avoiding shall and must.

89
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,560
Don't forget to join us again soon.

90
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,120
Goodbye.

91
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,519
Bye-bye.
