00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:12,200
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,800
And I'm Beth. How old are you, Beth?

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,800
That's a very personal question, Neil.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,000
Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,039
Anyway, at least you're not a centenarian.

7
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:24,679
Someone who's lived to be a hundred years old.

8
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:28,240
Are you saying I look a hundred? That's even rude.

9
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:34,479
Sorry, Beth, no. It's just that with advances in modern medicine, people are living longer

10
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:35,799
and longer.

11
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:41,960
There was a time when living to a hundred seemed impossible. But in 2021, the United Nations

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,599
Population Division estimated there to be over half a million centenarians worldwide.

13
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:51,119
And that number is set to rise.

14
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:57,399
So how do you live to a hundred? And what could life be like in your twilight years?

15
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:02,199
A phrase meaning your old age or the last years of your life.

16
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:06,560
That's what we'll be discussing in this programme and of course we'll be learning some useful

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,679
new vocabulary too.

18
00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:15,719
But first I have a question for you, Beth. In 2022, the world's oldest certified person

19
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:25,439
died aged 119. But which country was she from? Was it A, Switzerland, B, Italy or C, Japan?

20
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,439
Hmm, I think the answer is Japan.

21
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,159
Okay, Beth, we'll find out the answer at the end of the programme.

22
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:39,079
Of all the many factors for long life, such as diet, exercise and keeping active, human

23
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:44,759
relationships are among the most important. People who are more connected with others and

24
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:50,200
have warmer relationships live longer and stay healthier. And according to psychiatrist

25
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,560
Robert Waldinger, talking here with the BBC World Service programme, the inquiry, those

26
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,480
relationships don't necessarily have to be with humans.

27
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:05,439
Introverts actually find having a lot of people around stressful. So they might only need

28
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,640
one or two close people. And that's all they need, that's all they want and that's just

29
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,480
fine for them. So one size doesn't fit all when it comes to how many relationships you

30
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:21,079
need to have a healthy life. It doesn't have to be done with another human. We know that

31
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:29,039
pets provide us with a great deal of comfort and joy and pets can calm us down.

32
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:35,399
Whether you're a shy introvert or noisy extrovert, what counts is friendship. Be that with

33
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:41,560
a human or a pet. Different things work for different people. So Dr Waldinger says it's

34
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,800
not one size fits all. A phrase meaning something which is suitable for everyone or every

35
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,920
purpose. So far we've mentioned the importance of diet, exercise and friendship, but some

36
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:01,240
people want more radical ways of defying death and staying young. Dr Neer Barzoli, director

37
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,439
of the American Federation for Aging Research, has developed three scenarios in his work

38
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:12,960
with Centenarians in the US. The first scenario called Doreen Gray, after the fictional character

39
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:19,639
who didn't age, involves delaying the aging process. Here's Dr. Barzoli explaining more

40
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:27,680
to BBC World Service Programme, the inquiry. The second scenario is what we call the Wolverine

41
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:35,039
or the fountain of youth, taking old people and make them young. This is very, very hard.

42
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:41,000
This will be the most complex things we can do. And the third scenario, and this is a very

43
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,799
exciting scenario, and we have some evidence that it works, is the Peter Pan scenario.

44
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:53,759
Peter Pan didn't grow old. The idea that you'll take people when they're 20 or 30 and give

45
00:03:53,759 --> 00:04:00,840
them a treatment every few months or every year, and you'll basically erase their aging

46
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:07,000
and let them age very, very slowly, which also will mean probably that it'll pass their

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
115-year maximal potential lifespan. All Dr. Barzoli's treatments are aimed at extending

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,720
lifespan. The length of time someone is normally expected to live. His second treatment, making

49
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,399
someone who is old younger, is called the fountain of youth, a legendary source of magical

50
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,359
water that keeps anyone who drinks it young forever.

51
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:38,079
Dr. Barzoli's third treatment involves slowing down the aging process so much that people hardly

52
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:44,879
age at all. This treatment is called Peter Pan, after the fictional boy who never grew up,

53
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:51,359
and is connected to another idiom, Peter Pan Syndrome, which describes an immature person

54
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,879
who has reached adulthood but refuses to take on adult responsibilities. But which country

55
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:03,199
was the certified oldest person in the world from? That was your question, Neil, and I

56
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,000
guessed Japan, but was I right?

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,960
You were correct! Kaneda Tanaka was born on the Japanese island of Kyushu. She lived

58
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:19,199
to 119, the oldest human ever recorded, and her secret, playing chess, eating chocolate

59
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,680
and drinking coffee. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this program

60
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,319
about centenarians, people aged 100 years or more.

61
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,240
Your twilight years are your old age.

62
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,319
The phrase one size fits all means suitable for everyone or every purpose.

63
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:43,159
A lifespan is the length of time someone is normally expected to live.

64
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:48,879
The legendary fountain of youth produces magical water so that anyone who drinks it

65
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:50,759
lives forever.

66
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:57,480
And finally, the phrase Peter Pan Syndrome describes an adult who refuses to grow up.

67
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,800
Once again, our six minutes are up.

Join us again soon for more useful vocabulary here at 6 Minute English. Goodbye for now.

69
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:06,639
