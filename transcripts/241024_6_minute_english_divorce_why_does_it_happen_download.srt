2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,880
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBCLearningEnglish.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,880
I'm Phil.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,320
And I'm Georgie.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,199
In the words of a famous 1960s pop song, breaking up is hard to do.

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,400
Divorce, when a married couple who no longer wants to be together separate, can be one

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,120
of life's toughest experiences.

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,280
During the 1990s, divorce rates in Europe and America were the highest in the world,

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,880
with almost half of all marriages ending in divorce.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,079
But since then, the trend has reversed, and divorce rates in the West have slowed.

11
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,480
Meanwhile, however, the number of couples divorcing in other parts of the world is on the

12
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,760
rise.

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,840
In this programme, we'll be hearing how divorce is talked about in different countries,

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,439
and as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary.

15
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,199
But first, I have a question for you, Georgie.

16
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:05,200
In Britain, one day of the year, in particular, is known by divorce lawyers and relationship

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,879
councillors as divorce day.

18
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,400
But which day is it?

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,719
A. Christmas day.

20
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:15,159
B. The first Monday of the New Year.

21
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,640
Or C. Mid-Summer's Day, the 24th of June.

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,519
Hmm, I think divorce day is the first Monday of the year.

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,359
Okay, Georgie, we'll find out if that's the correct answer later in the programme.

24
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:33,560
Getting married very young, and differences between partners' backgrounds or interests,

25
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,199
are two common causes for couples to grow apart.

26
00:01:37,199 --> 00:01:42,799
Today, Marina Adshade is a professor at the University of British Columbia, who studies

27
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,719
the economics of sex and relationships.

28
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:48,679
But her life has a very different beginning.

29
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,760
As she told BBC World Service programme, the Global Story.

30
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,800
I married really young.

31
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,280
I had no education.

32
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,640
I married somebody who was older than me, who had a lot of education, and our relationship

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,360
worked well for a while.

34
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,880
And then in my late 20s, I decided to go back to school.

35
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,400
I no longer wanted to be a stay-at-home mother, which was what I was doing in my 20s.

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,800
And that change in our situation for us just became completely unresolvable.

37
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,439
And I think this is true for a lot of marriages, because people situation changes over their

38
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,439
lives.

39
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:25,640
Maybe they want children, and maybe they change their minds.

40
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,920
Marina started her married life as a stay-at-home mum, a woman who stays home to take care of

41
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,920
the children and manage the household.

42
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,760
Marina married an older man, and although their relationship started well, over time they

43
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,880
developed different ideas about what they wanted from life.

44
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,439
Marina and her husband changed their minds.

45
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:49,359
They changed an earlier decision they had made.

46
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:53,439
Growing apart is one of the most frequently given reasons for divorce.

47
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:58,799
And eventually, Marina and her husband's problems became unresolvable, not able to be

48
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:01,960
fixed or satisfactorily ended.

49
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,919
Marina's experience is typical of someone who finds themselves trapped in a marriage

50
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,840
that no longer works.

51
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,560
Yet unfortunately, due to economic or emotional reasons, many people stay trapped.

52
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,640
So what can be done?

53
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,960
Now some countries are looking to the authorities rather than the couple themselves for a solution.

54
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:28,719
Here Lucy Hockings, presenter of BBC World Services, The Global Story, and divorce counsellor

55
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,800
Joanna Gosling, discuss a new strategy being used in China.

56
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,280
There was an interesting thing they did in China where they introduced this cooling off

57
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,280
period.

58
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,520
So the government enforced this.

59
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:47,600
Does that work when the government intervenes in a situation like this and makes people behave

60
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,280
or do things in a certain way?

61
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,040
If nothing changes in the dynamic between two people, being told that they've got to cool

62
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,480
off and wait a bit longer, I don't think it's going to make them suddenly realise that

63
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,320
they want to be together.

64
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,520
It might be an idea for states to invest in communication programmes for these couples

65
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,360
because that's invariably why relationships fall apart.

66
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,080
In response to rising divorce rates, in 2021, the Chinese government introduced a 30-day

67
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,960
cooling off period for couples wanting to separate.

68
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,879
A cooling off period is a period of time in which two groups who are arguing can try to

69
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:25,400
improve the situation before taking further action.

70
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,600
However, it's unusual for governments to intervene to become involved in people's private

71
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,480
lives this way.

72
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,240
Joanna Dout's a cooling off period will work, especially as the main reason for the

73
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,040
relationship's failing is non-communication.

74
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,480
She says a lack of communication is invariably, or always, the reason for divorce.

75
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,879
On the plus side, by communicating openly, maybe with the professional help of a relationship

76
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:55,840
counsellor, saving a marriage is possible.

77
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,000
I think it's time you reveal the answer to your question, Phil.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,280
You asked about divorce day in Britain, and I guessed it was the first Monday of the

79
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,439
New Year.

80
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,959
I guess, Georgie, because that's the correct answer.

81
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,560
Divorce day is the first Monday of the year.

82
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,319
OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt in this programme, starting with stay at

83
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:24,519
home mum, a phrase for a woman who stays home to care for her children and manage the household.

84
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:29,879
If you change your mind, you change an earlier decision you made or opinion you had.

85
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:35,399
If a problem is unresolvable, it cannot be satisfactorily solved or fixed.

86
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:40,959
The cooling off period is a period of time for two people to try to resolve their differences.

87
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,319
It can also mean an agreed length of time in which someone can change their mind about

88
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,519
something they've agreed to buy.

89
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:53,079
To intervene means to become involved in a difficult situation in order to improve it.

90
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:57,239
And finally, the adverb invariably means always.

91
00:05:57,239 --> 00:06:02,079
Once again, our six minutes are up, but remember to join us again next time for more trending

92
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,199
topics and useful vocabulary.

93
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,199
Bye for now.

94
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,199
Bye.
