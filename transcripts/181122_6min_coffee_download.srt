From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,080
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,280
And I'm Catherine.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,359
Catherine, I'm going to start this program with a quick test just for you.

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,559
Oh, I love tests.

9
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,160
Complete this phrase.

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,839
Wake up and smell the...

11
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:26,719
Coffee!

12
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:27,960
Coffee, Neil, it's coffee.

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,839
I have to say that I love coffee.

14
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:30,640
It's great.

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,399
Yeah, okay.

16
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:32,719
So, do you drink much?

17
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,280
Well, just a couple of cups, you know.

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,439
Every day?

19
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:38,480
No, no, every hour.

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,519
I love coffee.

21
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:41,039
Don't you like coffee, Neil?

22
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:41,920
I do.

23
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,000
Maybe not as much as you.

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,280
What's the best thing about it?

25
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,079
Oh, it's a smell.

26
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,120
It's got to be the smell.

27
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,920
You know, when you open the packet, it's great, isn't it?

28
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,159
Uh, yes, but it never quite tastes as good as it smells, does it?

29
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,359
Well, no, not really.

30
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,719
It's always a bit disappointing.

31
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:57,519
I live in hope.

32
00:00:57,519 --> 00:00:59,359
Another cup, I think it'll be better.

33
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,839
I might change brands, actually, and try a different one.

34
00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:03,039
Yeah, okay.

35
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,959
You've had quite a lot of coffee today, haven't you?

36
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,799
I just the usual as six cups.

37
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,039
Well, our topic is the smell of coffee and coffee

38
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:13,359
is also the subject of today's question.

39
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,159
The world's biggest producer of coffee is...

40
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:16,960
Brazil!

41
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,760
Brazil!

42
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,319
Yes, yes, but that's not the question.

43
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,079
The question is, Brazil is the biggest coffee producer,

44
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:27,200
which is the second largest coffee producing country.

45
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,880
Is it a Columbia, B Vietnam or C Ethiopia?

46
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,600
Right, so it's not Brazil, but I bet it's another South American country.

47
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,439
So I'm going to go for Columbia.

48
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,719
Columbia, is that right?

49
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,159
Okay, we'll have the answer later in the program by which time maybe

50
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,439
the caffeine will have left your body, Catherine.

51
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,680
Tim Hayward is a coffee shop owner.

52
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,000
He appeared in the BBC Radio 4 program, the kitchen cabinet.

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,400
How important, does he say, the smell of coffee is?

54
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,960
It is absolutely vital.

55
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,320
It's the key thing.

56
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,760
And when you walk into the coffee shop in the morning and that smell hits you,

57
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,360
you're getting physiological responses.

58
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,360
So how important is it?

59
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,640
Feeling a bit calm and now,

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,439
Tim Hayward says the smell of coffee is vital.

61
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,840
That means it's very important.

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,319
It's perhaps the most important thing.

63
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,000
And he backs us up by saying that it's the key thing.

64
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,360
Something that's key is essential.

65
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,719
It's really important.

66
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,439
And he says that when you experience the smell, when the smell hits you,

67
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,599
you get a physiological response.

68
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,439
This phrase means your body has a reaction to the smell of coffee.

69
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,240
Perhaps your mouth begins to water in anticipation.

70
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,080
Catherine, when you get a coffee, do you normally have it there or take it away?

71
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,800
Well, I usually take it away.

72
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,240
Although if I'm feeling really in need of a coffee hit,

73
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,520
I might have one there and then get another one to take with me.

74
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,760
Can you describe the container that you're given when you have a coffee to go?

75
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,200
Yes, it's in a tall paper cup with a lid.

76
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,080
And the lid has a hole in it so that I can drink that lovely coffee.

77
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,840
Don't you think that's a problem?

78
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,240
I mean, we know how important the smell is,

79
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,520
so what's the effect of the lid on that experience?

80
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,719
The effect of the lid.

81
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,280
Yeah, well, here's Tim Hayward again,

82
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,840
talking about coffee being served with lids.

83
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,600
What baffles me is how many of the large coffee chains

84
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,439
actually sell a product in a cup that removes the smell.

85
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,400
So you walk into the coffee shop, you get the smell,

86
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,760
but when you actually take the drink out,

87
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,400
you're drinking it from something that's designed to deliver the hot liquid

88
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,680
directly past your tongue,

89
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,080
but stop any smell coming up to your nose.

90
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,439
That's just weird.

91
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,879
So what is it he's describing there?

92
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,200
I see. Yes, he's talking about the big coffee chains.

93
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:52,079
A chain is a company that has lots of its stores in towns and cities,

94
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,839
sometimes around the world.

95
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:57,359
I think we can all think of a few well-known coffee chains.

96
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:01,280
And he says that by putting a lid on takeaway cups,

97
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,359
you're actually blocking the smell.

98
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:08,000
That smell that is really important to the coffee experience.

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,799
Yes, and he says he finds that weird,

100
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,199
which is a way of saying he finds it unusual,

101
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,399
thinks it's strange.

102
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,200
Odd.

103
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,000
So much so that he says it baffles him.

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,800
If you are baffled by something you find it confusing,

105
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,800
you can't really understand it.

106
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,319
Here's Tim Hayward again.

107
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,840
What baffles me is how many of the large coffee chains

108
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,680
actually sell a product in a cup that removes the smell.

109
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,639
So you walk into the coffee shop, you get the smell,

110
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,000
but when you actually take the drink out,

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,639
you're drinking it from something that's designed to deliver the hot liquid

112
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,920
directly past your tongue,

113
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,319
but stop any smell coming up to your nose.

114
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,920
That's just weird.

115
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,959
That was coffee shop owner Tim Hayward.

116
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,560
Right, before we have another cup of this week's vocabulary,

117
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,639
let's get the answer to the question.

118
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,679
After Brazil, which country produces most coffee?

119
00:04:55,679 --> 00:05:00,479
Is it a Columbia, b Vietnam or C Ethiopia?

120
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,679
Catherine, you said...

121
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:03,839
I said it was a Columbia.

122
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,359
Ah, sorry, no extra coffee for you today.

123
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,679
The answer is Vietnam.

124
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:11,759
And now onto the vocabulary we looked at.

125
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,719
Take it away, Catherine.

126
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,800
So the first word was vital, which is an adjective that means very important.

127
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,600
And another word with a very similar meaning was key, meaning essential.

128
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,360
Next, we had the phrase physiological responses.

129
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,480
Physiological refers to what our bodies do and a response is a reaction.

130
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,720
So a physiological response is a reaction your body has to something

131
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,080
like the smell of coffee.

132
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,280
Something that baffles you, confuses you.

133
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,879
You don't understand it.

134
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,079
You might find something that baffles you to be weird.

135
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,359
This adjective means unusual or strange.

136
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:54,799
And finally, a chain is a group of shops from the same company with the same name.

137
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,439
Well, that is the end of our programme.

Bye.

142

Thanks for your coffee.

143
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:09,839
