Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Sam.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,000
And I'm Neil.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,839
Neil, would you describe yourself as a numbers person?

6
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:27,359
If you mean am I someone who understands numbers and is good at using them

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,640
and interpreting data, then no.

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,920
Okay, so maybe you're like me.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,840
You weren't good at maths at school?

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,120
No, I wasn't.

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,079
Algebra, geometry, times tables, it was all very confusing.

12
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,960
Yeah, we're not alone, Neil.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,320
But the fear of numbers might just be in our heads

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,840
and we might have enough number knowledge to get by with.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,519
That's what we'll be exploring in this programme

16
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:53,880
while looking at some relevant vocabulary.

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,439
But, sorry, Neil.

18
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,880
I'm going to start with a maths question.

19
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:02,280
It's thought the largest number in the world is called a Google.

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,680
It's written with a one and how many zeros?

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:15,000
Is it a 100 zeros, b 1000 zeros or c 10000 zeros?

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,680
I'll guess 10000 zeros.

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,280
Okay, I'll reveal the answer later on.

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,640
But let's talk more about the fear of numbers now.

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,320
Of course, numbers are important in our lives,

26
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:31,039
but one bad experience at school can put us off them for life.

27
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:34,679
Put off means make someone dislike something.

28
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:37,919
What put me off maths was it was not only complicated,

29
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:40,959
but very theoretical, not very practical,

30
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,560
useful for real life situations.

31
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,239
And the problem now is it's easy to be fooled by fancy figures

32
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:49,000
that we get told about.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,479
This is something the Y Factor programme on BBC World Service

34
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,039
has been exploring.

35
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,600
They spoke to Charles Syff, who's an author and professor at New York University,

36
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,880
who explained why we're at the mercy of people who throw numbers at us.

37
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,120
Because we are primed not to question numbers,

38
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:14,040
certain people have learned that numbers are perhaps the most powerful tools for deception.

39
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,960
Advertisers, marketers, politicians who try to convince the public

40
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,879
through a serious oratory have learned

41
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:25,879
that the one thing that they can't get challenged on is numbers,

42
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:28,159
or a challenge is ineffective.

43
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:32,120
Interesting words from Charles Syff there.

44
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,840
He explains that numbers might be a powerful tool for deceiving people.

45
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,240
Many of us are primed, so told to behave in a certain situation and in a certain way,

46
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,199
not to question numbers, except them as fact.

47
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes, and this is dangerous.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,639
So when politicians, for example, do good and effective public speaking,

49
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:57,479
known as oratory, the information they give could be spurious.

50
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:01,119
That means false, not correct or inaccurate.

51
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:03,519
But numbers are more persuasive.

52
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,199
They make you believe something is true.

53
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:08,439
So unless you're confident with numbers,

54
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:12,679
you're unlikely to challenge the facts and figures that you're given.

55
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:17,719
So Sam, if I said to you that 10% of the 10 million people who eat meat

56
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:21,560
have a 20% chance of being 5% overweight,

57
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,159
would you challenge that?

58
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,439
I'd have to go away and work that out.

59
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,039
As I said, Neil, I'm not a numbers person.

60
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:31,360
Even talking about numbers makes me anxious.

61
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,759
Well, interestingly, the Y Factor program explained that girls are more anxious about learning maths.

62
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,560
But even if they feel more nervous about maths,

63
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,360
they aren't any worse with numbers than their more confident classmates.

64
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,080
It's just the fear that's stopping you.

65
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:53,800
Well, maybe, but one bad experience can knock out a confidence and ability to use maths.

66
00:03:53,800 --> 00:04:00,280
Take comfort from Paula Miles, who teaches statistics to psychology students at St Andrews University.

67
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:07,280
She told the Y Factor that she thinks there's no such thing as a numbers person.

68
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,840
There is no such thing as someone who's a number person or not.

69
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,920
If we're taught in the right way, then I think we all have the potential to be a numbers person.

70
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:17,439
I'm not saying we're all going to grow up to be mathematicians,

71
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:23,079
but we're all going to get to a point where we have the basic numeracy skills that we need

72
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,399
to be able to cope in our environment.

73
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,599
I feel a little better now.

74
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:32,120
We all have the possibility within us,

75
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,360
or potential, to be a numbers person.

76
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,399
Yes, I think it's about survival.

77
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:39,279
We want to develop numeracy,

78
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,319
basic mathematical skills,

79
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:44,800
to use numbers in a particular situation that we're in.

80
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,000
We might not be a genius like Einstein,

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,480
but we know enough to work things out.

82
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,560
I wonder if you worked out the answer to my question correctly, Neil.

83
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,920
Earlier, I asked about what's thought to be the largest number in the world called a Google.

84
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,960
How many zeros does it have?

85
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,120
100 zeros?

86
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,280
A thousand zeros or 10,000 zeros?

87
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,120
I said 10,000 zeros.

88
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:12,959
Sorry, Neil.

89
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,480
A Google is 10 to the 100th power,

90
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,000
so a mere 100 zeros.

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,959
I don't think I'll be using that number anytime soon,

92
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,480
but I might be using some of the vocabulary we've discussed today,

93
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,720
including a numbers person.

94
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,360
That's someone who understands numbers and is good at using them and interpreting data,

95
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,560
not like us.

96
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,879
If you are put off something,

97
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,759
it means you are made to dislike something,

98
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,600
and to be primed means to behave in a certain situation.

99
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,600
The skill of effective public speaking is known as oratory,

100
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,720
and curious means false, inaccurate or not correct.

101
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,920
And when we have the possibility within us to do something,

102
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,160
we describe it as our potential,

103
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,319
and having numeracy means having basic mathematical skills.

104
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,639
Now we've reached the number six.

105
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,159
Six minutes of English.

106
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,680
Thanks very much for listening.

107
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,639
Goodbye.

108
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,519
Goodbye.

109
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,439
Six minutes English from the BBC.
