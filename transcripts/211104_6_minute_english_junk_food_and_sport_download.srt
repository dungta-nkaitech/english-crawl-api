Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,160
And I'm Sam.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,839
The Olympic Games happened every four years and the most recent games were held in Tokyo this summer.

5
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,039
Did you watch them Sam?

6
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:31,679
Yes, I saw British swimmer Adam PC, winner gold medal and my personal favourite was 13-year-old

7
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,799
sky brown, competing in an exciting sport which was added to the Olympics this year.

8
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:37,840
skateboarding.

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,239
Olympic athletes inspire people around the world to take on new challenges,

10
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,239
eat healthily and get fit. So it seems strange that some of the companies that sponsor or pay for

11
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,560
the Olympic Games also sell food and drink which is linked to obesity, heart disease and diabetes.

12
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,039
tobacco advertising was banned from international sport in 2005 because of the harmful effects of

13
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,280
smoking. But other companies selling less than healthy products still sponsor the exhausting events.

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,120
These could be sugary drinks companies or others who sell fast food, hot food like hamburgers

15
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,879
that is quick to cook and serve which is often unhealthy.

16
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,599
In this programme we'll be asking whether it's right for companies selling unhealthy products

17
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:23,599
disponsors forting events.

18
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:55,919
Phoebe is A because they wanted to call french fries McFrys.

19
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:58,879
Okay Sam we'll find out the answer later in the programme.

20
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:04,319
Someone who is worried about the relationship between fast food and sport is Dr Sandra Dimaio.

21
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,120
He worked for the World Health Organization specialising in obesity before starting his own

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,759
public health agency in Australia.

23
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,240
Here is Dr Dimaio speaking with BBC World Service programme The Food Chain

24
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,519
about the problem with unhealthy brands and food products.

25
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,560
By having their brand alongside a young person's favourite sporting hero on the

26
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,200
chest of their national team it does two things. First of all it creates brand attachment so if you're

27
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,960
a young child and you build the connection in your mind that basically fast food equals success.

28
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,120
At the same time it also gives a health halo to that brand.

29
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,719
Then you start to think in your mind even subconsciously that it can't be that bad.

30
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:52,159
You've probably heard of brand loyalty where people have a favourite brand they always buy

31
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,840
but Dr Dimaio is concerned about brand attachment.

32
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,479
Brand attachment is the emotional connection between humans and brands.

33
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:06,319
It goes deeper than loyalty so that people mentally connect a particular company with feelings of

34
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,039
winning, being healthy and success.

35
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:14,159
The problem comes when these feelings attach to companies that aren't healthy at all.

36
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,680
Dr Dimaio says this creates a health halo.

37
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:24,719
The belief that something is good like an angel's halo even though there is little evidence to support this.

38
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:30,400
On the other hand fast food and fizzy drink companies invest large amounts of money in sport.

39
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,359
Over 4.5 billion dollars since the 2016 Rio Olympics.

40
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:37,840
Much of it supporting athletes around the world.

41
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,519
Yes with travel, training and equipment the cost of being an Olympic athlete can be huge.

42
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,879
And depending on your country and your sport there may be little financial help.

43
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,319
Many athletes are desperate for any sponsorship they can get.

44
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,840
Does that make it right to promote unhealthy eating in return?

45
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,519
Not according to Dr Dimaio who thinks people should worry about the nutritional value of fast food.

46
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,120
As he explained to BBC World Services the food chain.

47
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,280
When we think about foods and beverages of public health concern we tend to start by

48
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,840
talking about highly processed foods, particularly ultra processed foods.

49
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,879
These are foods that have been really broken down to their kind of basic elements and then

50
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,920
built up their more products really than foods.

51
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,000
You know they're made in a laboratory not a kitchen.

52
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,680
Dr Dimaio mentions unhealthy foods and beverages, another word for drinks.

53
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,160
He's concerned about the public health risk of ultra processed food.

54
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,279
Foods containing extra ingredients like chemicals,

55
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,679
colourings and sweetness that you wouldn't add when cooking homemade food.

56
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:47,279
A potato for example is natural, minimally processed,

57
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:52,719
make a potato when it becomes processed, make french fries and it's ultra processed.

58
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:56,799
And speaking of french fries Neil what was the answer to your question?

59
00:04:56,799 --> 00:05:03,599
Yes I asked Sam the reason behind the decision McDonald's made not to sponsor the 2024 Paris Olympics.

60
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:08,239
And I said it was A because they wanted to call french fries McFrys.

61
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,120
Which was the wrong answer I'm afraid.

62
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,400
In fact McDonald's wanted to be the only company allowed to advertise cheese so it could boost

63
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,160
cheeseburger sales. This didn't go down well with officials in France, a country with over a

64
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,480
thousand different types of cheese. Okay let's recap the vocabulary from this programme starting with

65
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,040
fast food, hot food that is quick to cook but maybe unhealthy.

66
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,480
Companies that sponsor sports events pay for them to happen.

67
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,520
Brand attachment is a psychological connection between someone and a brand.

68
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,319
A health halo is the perception that something is healthy for you even if it's not.

69
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:52,480
Ultra processed foods are foods containing added artificial ingredients like colourings and preservatives.

70
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,879
And beverage is another word for a drink.

71
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,560
That's all from us but if you'd like to find out more about the business, science and culture of food
