00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,600
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Rob.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,640
And I'm Sam.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,600
As awful as the coronavirus pandemic has been,

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,839
it's also highlighted the compassionate side of human nature.

7
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,240
Doctors and nurses helping the sick.

8
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:33,759
Yes, and people helping out elderly relatives and neighbours raising money for charity

9
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,799
or wearing a face mask to keep others safe.

10
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,719
But the pandemic has also highlighted a more worrying issue,

11
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,399
called compassion fatigue. Have you heard of that, Sam?

12
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,280
Yes, I think compassion fatigue is a kind of emotional exhaustion,

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,039
which reduces your ability to empathise or feel compassion for others.

14
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,679
Yes, exactly, Sam. Compassion fatigue has long been a problem for people working in medical professions,

15
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,920
and it's the topic of this programme.

16
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,879
We'll be hearing how the suffering and unhappiness we see on the TV news can increase feelings of helplessness.

17
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,079
But first, let me ask you my quiz question, Sam.

18
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,400
Humanitarian workers see human suffering on a daily basis,

19
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,400
and can easily fall victim to compassion fatigue.

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,960
Founded in 1971, Medisson som frontier is one of the biggest humanitarian organisations.

21
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,960
But what does Medisson som frontier mean?

22
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,080
Is it a medicine to the frontline?

23
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,800
B doctors without borders or C medicine first?

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,560
Hmm, I remember newspapers calling it MSF and using its English name,

25
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,640
which I think was B doctors without borders.

26
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:53,760
Okay, Sam will find out the answer later on.

27
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,719
Compassion fatigue centers on the idea that we can feel too much empathy,

28
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,000
and that feeling can lead to emotional burnout.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,960
According to psychologist Margaret Heffinen,

30
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,639
caring and fatigue are closely connected.

31
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,560
Caring for others means taking on someone's pain yourself,

32
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,920
and this can have unhealthy consequences for the carer.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,679
Well, here's Margaret Heffinen talking to BBC World Services,

34
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:21,759
the documentary podcast.

35
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,560
See if you can hear the effects of compassion fatigue she mentions.

36
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,439
As you find people spending more and more time online,

37
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,079
reading more and more and more depressing news,

38
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,679
and they become more and more numb,

39
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:36,079
they also become more and more addicted to it.

40
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:39,359
And this develops a kind of state of mind

41
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,799
that is a kind of, it's a form of learned helplessness,

42
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:45,439
right, because I'm consuming something that's upsetting me.

43
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,919
But I cannot do anything about it.

44
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,240
Margaret Heffinen mentions that spending too much time

45
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,400
reading, depressing online news can leave us feeling numb,

46
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,120
unable to feel any emotions,

47
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,120
or think clearly because we're so upset or afraid.

48
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,800
The news exposes us to human suffering around the world,

49
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,800
which we feel powerless to help.

50
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,919
This can lead to something which in psychology

51
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,400
is called learned helplessness,

52
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,599
giving up trying to feel better because your previous attempts

53
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,879
have not worked.

54
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,840
This is all incredibly depressing, Rob.

55
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,680
It sounds like we have limited amounts of compassion.

56
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,879
Well, there are more positive ways of looking at it, Sam.

57
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,400
Here's an alternative view from Tom Rivett-Karnack,

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,000
speaking with BBC World Services, the documentary podcast.

59
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,840
I understand why you're saying that it's finite,

60
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,759
but I also think compassion is a habit.

61
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:44,799
So dwelling with that, developing that habit,

62
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,359
yes, there are a lot of headwinds to that,

63
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:50,799
and the rapid acceleration of the news cycle,

64
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,000
the focus on the next problem so quickly,

65
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,000
draws our attention away from developing those deeper habits

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,039
as humanity that gives us that courage and that strength

67
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,879
to make these big transformations.

68
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,840
Like Margaret Heffinen, Tim Rivett-Karnack believes

69
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,560
the news media is part of the problem.

70
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,520
Online newspapers and social media speed up the news cycle,

71
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,399
the reporting of a particular news story

72
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,879
from the first instance to the last.

73
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,560
As a result, we are constantly worrying about the next problem,

74
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,439
and this can easily lead to emotional fatigue.

75
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,759
Tom emphasizes compassion as a habit to be developed

76
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,840
instead of something finite, limited or having a fixed size.

77
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,360
But such compassionate habits can be difficult to cultivate

78
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,520
because they face many headwinds,

79
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,960
forces blowing in the opposite direction

80
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,199
which stop you moving forward.

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,199
Headwinds such as the rapid news cycle,

82
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,560
which distracts us from developing compassion and courage.

83
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,560
Maybe the answer is to help in whatever ways we can

84
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,639
without becoming hard-hearted,

85
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,240
like the volunteers of MSF.

86
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,720
Yes, your quiz question, Rob.

87
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,520
You asked what the French name

88
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,159
Medicines of Frontier means in English,

89
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:11,680
and I said B,

90
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,359
Doctors Without Borders.

91
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:16,159
Which was the correct answer, well done.

92
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:20,479
Doctors without borders offer volunteer medical assistance

93
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,799
in the world's worst conflict zones.

94
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:25,199
Okay, Rob, let's recap the vocabulary

95
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,079
starting with compassion fatigue, emotional exhaustion

96
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,039
which reduces your feelings of compassion.

97
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,479
This can leave you numb,

98
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,319
unable to feel any emotions because you are so shocked or scared.

99
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,720
Learned helplessness is a psychological term

100
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,759
for when someone stops trying to feel better

101
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,080
because the previous attempts have failed.

102
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,920
Some people believe that compassion is finite,

103
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,759
limited or having a fixed size.

104
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,520
And it can be disturbed by the news cycle,

105
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,120
the round of media reports and reactions to a new story.

106
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,080
Which can be a headwind or opposing force

107
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,759
which stops us caring for others.

108
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,279
And that's it for this edition of Six Minute English.

109
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,319
Bye for now. Bye.
