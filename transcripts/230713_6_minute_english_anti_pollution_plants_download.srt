6-Mute English from the BBC

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,800
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,839
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,439
Now, imagine a field polluted by spilled oil.

5
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:20,879
Toxic waste has mixed into the water and chemical fumes have overtaken the air,

6
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,480
leaving animals dead and the land unsafe for humans.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,800
Unfortunately, situations like this are common all over the world.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,719
Cleaning up chemical pollution is dangerous and expensive,

9
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,920
and mostly involves highly technological equipment.

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,399
But what if there was a more natural solution?

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,159
Recently, scientists have been developing a new technique for cleaning pollution,

12
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,400
letting plants do the work instead.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:53,040
Yes, plants like water hire synths have been used to clean rivers by sucking up oil spilled into the water,

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,480
and researchers have successfully used fungi to break down plastic waste.

15
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,000
In this programme, we'll be hearing about plants that fight pollution,

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,840
and of course we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,799
But first, I have a question for you, Neil.

18
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,920
One word we'll be hearing a lot in this programme is phytoromediation,

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,000
the technique that certain plants use to remove harmful chemicals from polluted environments.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,599
But how do they do this?

21
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,400
Is it by using A, their leaves, B, their roots,

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,719
or C, their seeds?

23
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,640
I think some plants clean up pollution using their roots.

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,080
Okay, Neil. We'll find out the correct answer later.

25
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:43,040
Phytoromedicating plants are certainly needed in one of the most oil polluted places on Earth.

26
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,160
The delta of the River Niger in Nigeria.

27
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:52,800
Ever since oil, known by the nickname Black Gold, was discovered there in the 1950s,

28
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,920
it's become central to Nigeria's economy.

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,680
But oil spills have devastated the region's landscape,

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,120
and there is mistrust between local communities

31
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,240
and the multinational oil companies working there.

32
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,640
Now, one woman and her plants are trying to fix the problem.

33
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,479
Eucaria Noichi is a biochemist from the University of Port Harcourt in Nigeria.

34
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:21,759
She uses phytoromediation to clean and protect the region's land and rivers.

35
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,199
Discussing Eucaria's work are Georgina Renard from the BBC Climate News team

36
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:32,479
and Maira Anubi, presenter of BBC World Service Programme People Fixing the World.

37
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,000
Eucaria is a specialist in phytoromediation.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,840
That word again, it basically means plants being used to clean up contaminated environments, right?

39
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,639
Right. And when I met her recently in London, she had just won the Maddox Prize.

40
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,280
This is a prestigious award for scientists showing courage in the face of hostility.

41
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,680
Now, the Niger Delta is a really dangerous and challenging place to work in.

42
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,199
And despite personal risk to her safety, Eucaria has spent 20 years teaching communities there

43
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,479
how these plants can suck up, talk the oil from the ground,

44
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,719
and bring their land back to life.

45
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,879
Eucaria's work won a prestigious scientific award.

46
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,000
Pristigious means admired and well respected.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,960
The award recognises the personal risks Eucaria takes in her efforts to bring the land back to life.

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,560
If you bring something back to life, you make it come alive again

49
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,600
or reanimated after it has died.

50
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:33,200
A big problem for climate scientists is being accepted and trusted by the people living in

51
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,080
polluted places, but Eucaria has found a way to work with local communities.

52
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,760
Listen to Georgina Renard of BBC World Services People Fixing the World,

53
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,640
who is followed by Eucarian White G herself.

54
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,120
Her success often comes from getting communities

55
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,039
you have deep mistrust of outsiders after broken promises from companies to clean up the oil spills.

56
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,280
She gets them to trust her and then they take ownership for the restoration of their land.

57
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,520
And I think Eucaria's magic formula really relies on diplomacy trust

58
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,400
and actually charisma, which is a very important quality.

59
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,080
We have a leadership structure.

60
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,879
So you have the chief, like traditional ruler, you have the women leader,

61
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,720
you have the youth leader, so you find out who those are.

62
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,280
And inform them of what you want to do.

63
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,480
Local people's mistrust of big oil companies comes from their broken promises,

64
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,880
times when they said they would definitely do something but then fail to.

65
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,520
Eucaria, on the other hand, is trusted because she consults the community

66
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,200
by speaking with local chiefs, the rulers or highest ranking leaders of a tribe.

67
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,560
What's more, Eucaria has lots of charisma.

68
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,800
This personal characteristic is the natural ability to attract, influence and inspire people.

69
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,120
Taken together, these make Eucaria's approach a magic formula,

70
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,959
a combination of actions that is likely to result in success.

71
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,600
It's good to hear a positive environmental news story for once, isn't it Neil?

72
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,800
But what's the science behind what Eucaria is doing?

73
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,199
How do plants clean up polluted environments?

74
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,279
To find that out, I need to reveal the answer to my question.

75
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,639
Right, you asked me how plants clean up pollution through phytoromediation.

76
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,039
I said it was using their roots.

77
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,439
And that was the correct answer.

78
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:28,399
Okay, it's time to recap the vocabulary we've learnt from the programme,

79
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:33,199
starting with the adjective prestigious, meaning admired and well-respected.

80
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,919
If you bring something back to life, you make it come alive again after being dead.

81
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,759
A broken promise is when you promise definitely to do something,

82
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,400
but then fail to do what you said you would.

83
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,920
A chief is the ruler of a tribe or the most important,

84
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,400
highest-ranking leader of an organisation.

85
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,920
Charisma is a special natural ability to attract, influence and inspire people.

86
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,800
And finally, the phrase a magic formula describes a combination of actions

87
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,200
that is likely to result in success.

88
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,840
Once again, our six minutes are up. Bye for now.

89
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,480
Goodbye.
