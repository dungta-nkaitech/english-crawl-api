00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
6 Minute English from the BBC

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,160
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Neil.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,280
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,439
Names tell us a lot about a person.

5
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:17,440
Many names have meanings.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,640
Paul, for example, means humble.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,440
And the name Anna originated from a Hebrew word meaning graceful.

8
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,679
Our name is an important part of our identity.

9
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,479
If you hear someone shout your name in the street, you automatically turn to look.

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:38,320
But names also reveal cultural and family connections, which give us a sense of our history

11
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,799
and our place in the world.

12
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:46,200
In this programme, we'll be meeting a writer whose name combines two very different sides of her identity,

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,760
one English and the other, Indian.

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:55,480
Sheila Banagee was born in Hayes, West London, to parents from the East Indian state of Bengal.

15
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:59,719
We'll be hearing about Sheila's research into her name and family history.

16
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:04,120
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,079
But first, I have a question for you, Neil.

18
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:11,599
As every parent knows, choosing your child's name isn't easy.

19
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:18,039
Names go in and out of fashion, and a name that was popular one year soon becomes old-fashioned.

20
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:23,560
So what was the most popular name for baby girls in the UK last year?

21
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:30,079
Was it A, Florence, B, Olivia, or C, Amelia?

22
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,480
Hmm, I'll guess it was Olivia.

23
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,560
Okay, Neil, we'll find out the answer later in the programme.

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:45,240
Sheila Banagee's name came out of her parents' journey from British India to West London in the 1950s.

25
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,920
Here, she tells BBC Radio 4 programme Word of Mouth

26
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,200
how reflecting on this journey inspired her new book What's in a Name,

27
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,280
which blends her own life story with history and politics.

28
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,600
As soon as I started thinking about it, you know, this name Sheila,

29
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,400
which is, you know, it's a seven-year-old girl living in Hayes called Sheila.

30
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,159
There's a very typical English name.

31
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,159
You know, what's that name doing there?

32
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:15,000
And if you start to pull up that, the threads lead you to the story of my Bengali parents' migration over here

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,640
to mass migration from the colonies after the war to this country.

34
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:24,639
And then Banagee contains all these stories about colonialism and cost.

35
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,319
Her parents wanted their daughter to feel safe in London,

36
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,079
so they gave her a typical English name, Sheila.

37
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:38,159
If something is typical, it shows the usual features of a particular type of person or thing.

38
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,639
It's a good example of that type.

39
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:45,479
She may have had a typical English name, but with dark skin and hair,

40
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,439
Sheila didn't look like some people's image of a typical English girl.

41
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:52,879
Wanting to find out more about her culture,

42
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,120
Sheila started to pull the threads behind her family story.

43
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,159
Pulling the threads is an idiom,

44
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,879
meaning to investigate deeper into something,

45
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:04,839
revealing the hidden connections behind it.

46
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:08,159
What Sheila discovered was a story of mass migration,

47
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,079
periods in history when large groups of people moved from one geographical area to another.

48
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,960
Mass migrations have happened throughout history

49
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,320
in the 1950s and 1960s,

50
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,200
many South Asian families,

51
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,520
including Sheila's migrated West to cities in the UK.

52
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,320
But this is just one half of the story.

53
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,400
Sheila's family name, Banagee,

54
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,040
reflects her roots in the Bengali culture of East India,

55
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,800
where surnames tell a lot about a person's social status or caste.

56
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,520
Here Sheila explain more to BBC Radio 4 programme, Wed of Mouth.

57
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,040
It is an Indian name, but actually it's not my real name.

58
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,800
You've got names like Banagee Mukaji Chatterjee,

59
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,040
which nowadays people hear over here,

60
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,760
but Banagee is an anglicised form of my original name,

61
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,960
which would have been Bondobantar,

62
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,520
and it's a name that was changed by the British when they went over there,

63
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,600
because they really basically couldn't be bothered to pronounce it or couldn't pronounce it.

64
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,320
And for me, it's always been a very mixed name,

65
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,280
because it signifies that we were colonial subjects,

66
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,240
and so it's a tricky name to be carrying around.

67
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,360
Sheila's surname is actually pronounced Bondobantar,

68
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,639
but during colonial times the name became anglicised.

69
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,519
It was changed to sound more English.

70
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,680
This happened a lot.

71
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,519
The surname's Chatterbantar became Chatterjee,

72
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,439
and Mukobantar became Mukaji,

73
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,240
either because the British rulers couldn't pronounce them,

74
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,079
or because they couldn't be bothered.

75
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,000
They didn't make the effort.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,879
Sheila feels her anglicised surname has always been tricky,

77
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:53,360
difficult to use, because of the association with colonialism and oppression.

78
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,319
Ironically, it was London,

79
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:57,079
the capital of the British Empire,

80
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:02,160
that in modern times became the destination for migrants from all over the world.

81
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,840
OK, it's time to reveal the answer to your question, Beth.

82
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,280
What was the most popular girl's name in 2022?

83
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,319
I guessed it was Olivia.

84
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:14,319
Which was the correct answer.

85
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:20,559
In 2022, Olivia remained the most popular girl's name for the sixth year in a row,

86
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:25,199
and was given to 3649 baby girls.

87
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,039
OK, let's recap the vocabulary from this programme starting with Typical,

88
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:34,959
containing the most usual features of a particular type of person or thing.

89
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,679
If you pull the threads of something,

90
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,920
you investigate it more deeply to find the hidden stories behind it.

91
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,680
Mass migration is the historical movement of large groups of people from one place to another.

92
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,600
If something is anglicised,

93
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,720
it's changed to sound or appear English.

94
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,160
If you can't be bothered to do something,

95
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,920
you don't make the effort to do it.

96
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,040
And finally, if something is tricky,

97
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,519
it's difficult to manage and requires careful use.

98
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,240
Once again, our six minutes are up.

99
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,840
Goodbye for now. Bye.

100
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,680
English from the BBC.
