From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,919
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,000
The show that brings you an interesting topic,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,879
authentic listening practice and vocabulary

8
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:22,960
to help you improve your language skills.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,679
I'm Rob.

10
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:24,879
And I'm Catherine.

11
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:26,960
In this programme we'll be discussing

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,679
quitting drinking and staying dry.

13
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:32,880
Right, so when you say quitting you mean giving up

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,920
and when you say drinking you're particularly referring

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,759
to the activity of drinking alcohol.

16
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:38,640
Exactly Rob.

17
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:41,280
But what about staying dry?

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,640
It's nothing to do with the weather.

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,679
No, that's true.

20
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:48,239
The adjective dry here means no alcohol.

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,159
And I, Rob, am currently having a dry January.

22
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,920
Oh yes, your new year's resolution is to give up alcohol for one month.

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,879
Any reason?

24
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,240
Yes, I'm doing it in order to improve my health

25
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,920
and save some money.

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,840
And a resolution, by the way,

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,400
is a promise to yourself to do something

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,240
or not to do something?

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,400
Right, well they seem like good reasons.

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,719
And for now we must keep up our resolution

31
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,960
to always start the programme with a question.

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,320
So are you ready for it, Catherine?

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,920
I am Crack on Rob.

34
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,159
Okay, according to data from the World Health Organization in 2015,

35
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,840
which country consumed the most alcohol per person?

36
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,800
Was it A?

37
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:27,920
Australia?

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,039
B? Finland?

39
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,879
Or C? The Czech Republic?

40
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,280
So, well they all sound quite likely,

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,280
but I did visit Prague once and I had a lovely time.

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,719
So I'm going to say, see the Czech Republic.

43
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,079
Okay, well as always we'll find out the answer later on.

44
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,640
But let's continue our discussion about drinking

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,679
or informally known as boozing and trying to give it up.

46
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,879
We all know that too much drinking can be bad for us

47
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,439
and that's why you, Catherine, have decided to quit

48
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,879
but only for a month.

49
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,640
Yes, just a month, but it's a start and I might continue

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,920
into February, but I'm seeing the benefits already.

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,759
I've managed to shed some weight,

52
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,079
most of which I actually put on over Christmas.

53
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:09,280
Yeah, I can see.

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,159
So to shed here simply means lose.

55
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,120
And I bet your sobriety is helping you sleep better.

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,000
sobriety by the way means the state of not being drunk.

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,919
It is actually and I'm not alone.

58
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,680
A study of 857 British adults

59
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,520
by Dr Richard Davisse from the University of Sussex

60
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,800
found that after going for a month without alcohol,

61
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,000
62% of the people in the study said they had better sleep.

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,800
So Rob, does that tempt you to become T total and stop drinking?

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,319
Uh, not me, Catherine.

64
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,360
I need a drink to help me relax and be more sociable.

65
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,879
You know how shy I am.

66
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,960
Yes, of course Rob.

67
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,680
Well, maybe you should listen to Catherine Gray.

68
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,480
Now she's the author of a book called

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,680
The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober,

70
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,719
which she wrote after she discovered the negative effects

71
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,840
of going to too many work related parties

72
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,319
where she was just drinking too much.

73
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,120
Here she is speaking on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programme.

74
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,560
I had a lot of social anxiety and when I quit,

75
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,680
I had to deal with that.

76
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,200
I think I used drinking as a crutch,

77
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,240
a confidence crutch.

78
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,600
It eased the way to go to big glittering parties and stuff.

79
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:26,079
And when I quit, I had to learn real confidence in a way.

80
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,840
So Catherine worked in the magazine business,

81
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,519
which involved going to lots of boozy parties.

82
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,199
Drinking, she says, helped her deal with a nervous and worried feeling

83
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,280
that she had when she met new people.

84
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,759
She called it social anxiety.

85
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,639
Yes, and she used drinking as a crutch.

86
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,439
Her crutch here is something you depend on for support,

87
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,680
and sometimes you rely on it too much.

88
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,680
Yes, and eventually she decided to abstain from drinking.

89
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,760
In other words, stop doing something that's enjoyable but bad for you

90
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,439
and she feels much better for it.

91
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,960
So Rob, come on, haven't you got the willpower to just quit drinking

92
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,719
for just 30 days?

93
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,480
Well, according to Catherine Grey, that wouldn't be long enough.

94
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,240
Experts say that it takes 66 days for a new habit to bed in,

95
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,960
so I would always recommend trying it for 90 days.

96
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,000
30 days is the hard bit before you get to the rewards.

97
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,279
Because after 66 days it starts getting a lot easier

98
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,319
and you start really feeling better in yourself.

99
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,959
Right, so it takes 66 days for doing a regular activity,

100
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,120
a habit to bed in.

101
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,839
And bed in means to become normal and start working properly.

102
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:41,759
Now, earlier, I asked you, according to data from the World Health Organization in 2015,

103
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,519
which country consumed the most alcohol per person?

104
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,199
Was it A Australia?

105
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,800
Finland or C the Czech Republic?

106
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,680
And I said the Czech Republic, was I right?

107
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,360
You were Catherine Spot on.

108
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,160
Yes.

109
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,000
Apparently 14.1 litres of pure alcohol is consumed per person each year.

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,519
Well, like I said, they do make good beer in the Czech Republic.

111
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,120
But people be careful only drink it in moderation.

112
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,360
Now Rob, shall we take a look at the vocabulary we've mentioned today?

113
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,160
Indeed, yes.

114
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,959
The first word we had was resolution.

115
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,479
That's a promise to yourself to do or not do something.

116
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,879
Catherine's news resolution was to give up drinking alcohol for a whole month.

117
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,799
Yes, and I'm still doing it, Rob.

118
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:29,839
The plan is to shed a few kilos and get fit.

119
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,759
So, for example, Rob shed lots of weight when he went on a cake-free diet.

120
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,159
Really? I'd never give up cake, Catherine.

121
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:42,799
But I could be tempted to give up booze as I know sobriety is good for my health.

122
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:46,079
That's the noun word to mean the state of not being drunk.

123
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:48,399
Now, our next word was abstain.

124
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:53,199
And that means not do something that's enjoyable, but bad for you.

125
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,959
So, Rob needs to abstain from eating cakes if he wants to wear his skinny jeans.

126
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,279
Are you dropping a hint there, Catherine?

127
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,360
Now, our final word is actually two words, bed in.

128
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,479
It means to become normal and start working properly.

129
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,279
It took a while for the new computer system to bed in,

130
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,279
but now it's working perfectly.

131
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,519
That's brilliant because now we can go online and find more BBC Learning English

132
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,239
programs at BBCLearningEnglish.com.

133
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:22,319
And that's all for today's Six Minute English.

134
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,679
We hope you enjoyed it.

135
00:06:23,679 --> 00:06:24,559
Bye for now.

136
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:25,359
Bye.
