5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,440
Hello, this is 6 Minute English and I'm Rob.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,480
And I'm Neil.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,160
Today we're talking about buttons.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,600
Yes, buttons.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,719
Buttons are what we have on our clothes to fasten them,

10
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:29,760
but the word is also used for things we push to make things happen.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,039
Things like your bedside alarm, radio, toaster kettle.

12
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:37,920
We press hundreds of buttons every week without thinking about it.

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,240
Not everyone likes buttons, though.

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,200
Particularly the ones we have on our clothes.

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,880
It's a recognised phobia.

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,520
What is this fear called?

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,000
Is it A, buttonophobia?

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,719
B, cumpu no phobia?

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,280
Or C, colrophobia?

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,719
Any ideas, Neil?

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,439
I think I've got a fear of pronouncing these words.

22
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:01,559
I've got no idea what the answer is.

23
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,399
I think buttonophobia is much too obvious,

24
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:05,799
so it's one of the others.

25
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,000
Or is it?

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,599
It's a hard one.

27
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:11,599
Well, I'll have the answer later in the programme.

28
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:14,400
Thinking aloud is a BBC Radio 4 programme

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,920
which covers a range of interesting topics.

30
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,920
Recently, they featured a discussion about buttons

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,680
and how important they are to everyday life.

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,400
Stephen Conner, professor of English at the University of Cambridge,

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,560
was on the programme

34
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,439
and he talked about the appeal of buttons.

35
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:33,280
What does he say about children and buttons?

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,159
We do love buttons and I think the pleasure

37
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,560
and the temptation of buttons,

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,320
this temptation and everyone feels it,

39
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,760
which is why buttons have to be very convenient.

40
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,960
On the other hand, they have to be kept away from children,

41
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,800
so they've got to be put quiet on the wall.

42
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,920
And buttons that really matter

43
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,840
have to be made quite hard to push

44
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,400
like put behind glass or something.

45
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,280
OK, what does he say about children and buttons?

46
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,680
That they have to be kept away from them.

47
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,920
As I said before, I loved pressing buttons as a child.

48
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,320
I would press any that I saw,

49
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,480
so important ones did have to be kept out of my reach.

50
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,840
Yes, he said buttons are a temptation.

51
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,400
A temptation is something that makes you want to do something

52
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,640
and it's often used when it's something you shouldn't really do.

53
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,319
So buttons that lead to potentially dangerous

54
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,200
or serious consequences,

55
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,839
like a fire alarm, need to be protected.

56
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:27,359
Maybe behind glass,

57
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:29,879
so temptation doesn't get the better of us.

58
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:33,560
But many buttons have a useful practical purpose in everyday life,

59
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,879
like calling a lift,

60
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,399
so these buttons have to be easy to use without difficulty.

61
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:40,919
The adjective for this is convenient.

62
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:43,879
These everyday buttons have to be convenient.

63
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,719
Professor Conner goes on to say a bit more about

64
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,319
why buttons are so appealing.

65
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,759
What's his opinion?

66
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:54,840
You know what I think? I think it's down to the fidgeting instinct

67
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,319
of very digital or manual creatures.

68
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,719
I think we want to fidget with things and adjust them.

69
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,479
We want to make them slightly better.

70
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,319
We want to smit it.

71
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,679
I guess it's the grooming instinct in Apes.

72
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:09,079
So then, why can't we resist buttons?

73
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:13,000
Because as humans, we have a fidgeting instinct.

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,799
We can't stay still for very long.

75
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:16,079
We need to move around a lot

76
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:18,879
because we aren't very digital creatures.

77
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:23,560
The use of digital, though, is nothing to do with modern online technology, is it?

78
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,879
No, a digit is a finger or toe.

79
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,759
So we are digital creatures.

80
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,319
We have fingers, and we like to use them.

81
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,719
And one thing other digital creatures do,

82
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,919
creatures like Apes, is grooming.

83
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,240
That is, they use their hands to clean the body hair of other apes.

84
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,439
They look through the hair for insects and bugs

85
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,359
and pull them out and eat them.

86
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:46,439
But we can also use the word grooming for humans.

87
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,599
Someone who is well groomed, for example,

88
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,599
is neat and tidy, clean and well-presented.

89
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,079
Here's Professor Conner again.

90
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,079
You know what I think?

91
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,120
I think it's down to the fidgeting instinct

92
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,599
of very digital or manual creatures.

93
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,000
I think we want to fidget with things and adjust them.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,719
We want to make them slightly better.

95
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,599
We want to smit it.

96
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,240
I guess it's the grooming instinct in Apes.

97
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,319
Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week's question.

98
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,280
Some people have a fear of buttons.

99
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,000
It's a recognised phobia.

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,680
But what's it called?

101
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,120
Is it A, buttonophobia?

102
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,319
B, cumpunophobia?

103
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:25,240
Or C, colrophobia?

104
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,720
And Neil, you said?

105
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,959
Well, I didn't, but I don't think it can be buttonophobia.

106
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,480
That would be too easy.

107
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,040
And I think colrophobia is a fear of clowns.

108
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,120
So I'm going for the other one.

109
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,879
Cumpunophobia.

110
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,199
That is right.

111
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,399
Buttonophobia is a made-up word.

112
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:49,000
And as you said, colrophobia is a fear of clowns.

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,479
Right, now let's review today's vocabulary.

114
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,360
We've been talking about buttons.

115
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,519
These can be small round things we use to fasten our clothes

116
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:59,759
or the things that we push to make something happen.

117
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,919
Buttons can be a temptation.

118
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,759
We see one, we want to push it.

119
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,279
So a temptation is something that makes us want to do something

120
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,599
we know we shouldn't.

121
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,360
And then we have the adjective convenient.

122
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,680
Something that's convenient is easy to use without difficulty.

123
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,960
For example, the buttons to call a lift

124
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,560
are at a very convenient height.

125
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,600
They can be reached easily.

126
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,000
Professor Connor went on to talk about our fidgeting instinct.

127
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,960
As humans, we love to fidget.

128
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,480
We like to keep moving around.

129
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,160
We can't stay still for very long

130
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,280
and we love to do stuff with our hands.

131
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,280
The professor talked about us being digital creatures,

132
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,080
which means creatures with fingers.

133
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,240
A digit is another word for a finger or toe.

134
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,439
And finally, we had grooming.

135
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:44,960
This is the habit of making ourselves look nice

136
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,439
by cleaning, washing and doing our hair.

137
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,560
It's something some animals, such as apes, do for each other.

138
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,079
Well, the button here in the studio is flashing,

139
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,600
which tells me it's time to wrap up for today.

140
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,720
Do John is next time, and if you can't wait,

141
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,280
you can always find us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube,

142
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,680
our app, and of course, on our website, BBCLearningEnglish.com.

143
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
Bye-bye for now.

144
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,800
Bye.

145
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,720
Can I just press that button?

146
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,120
Go on then, if you like.
