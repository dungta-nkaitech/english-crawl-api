00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:13,040
Hello and welcome to 6-Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Beth.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,960
And I'm Neil. Today we're going to talk about climate change

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,080
and how it can affect people's mental health.

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,039
Natural disasters and the impacts of climate change

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,199
can be stressful, isn't that right, Beth?

7
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,280
Yeah, definitely. In today's episode we're going to find out

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,560
about how people can protect their mental health

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,520
from the impacts of climate change. We'll be hearing from a psychiatry expert

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,760
and a man who survived a wildfire and helped rebuild his town.

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,000
But first, Beth, I have a question for you.

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,600
Scientists aren't always sure whether natural disasters like floods and wildfires

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,719
are as a result of human-caused climate change.

14
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,719
But in January 2025, big wildfires affected big parts of Los Angeles

15
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,560
in California. But according to the research organisation

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,159
World Weather Attribution, human-caused climate change

17
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:14,400
made the fires A 10% more likely, B 35% more likely, or C 20% less likely.

18
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,840
I'm going to say 10% more likely.

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,960
Okay, well, we'll find out the answer at the end of the program.

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,280
Now natural disasters like floods and wildfires can destroy homes and communities.

21
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,040
People who live in areas affected by natural disasters

22
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,680
can often experience climate trauma.

23
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,079
Trauma is what we call the very bad and long-lasting emotional effects

24
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,920
of an event or experience.

25
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,680
Professor Jotty Misra is an expert in climate trauma at the University of California.

26
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,439
She explained more about the condition to Greia Jackson, host of BBC World Service program,

27
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,480
the climate question.

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,480
Climate trauma is not an individual trauma.

29
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,560
It's a community-wide trauma, which really requires community-wide healing.

30
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,680
Yeah, I'm really struck by what you've said about the fact that it's

31
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,039
whole communities that are affected, not individuals,

32
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,719
but also part of the solution is about the community and how it rebuild and

33
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,000
renits together.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,159
Absolutely, yes. So we've found that individuals who have a greater

35
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:25,599
sense of positive support from their family

36
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,560
and a greater sense of meaningful connection with their community,

37
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,199
they are in general more resilient.

38
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,840
Jotty's research on climate trauma has found that it affects

39
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,719
communities rather than individuals.

40
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:45,199
Host of the program, Greia Jackson, is struck by what Jotty says.

41
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,840
If you're struck by an idea, you find it particularly interesting or impressive.

42
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,280
Greia says that part of the solution to climate trauma could be in how the community

43
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,879
renits together.

44
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,039
This means how the social connections in a community are restored.

45
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:07,439
We can often describe a community as close-knit, which means everyone helps and supports each other.

46
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:13,759
Jotty explains that having a strong community also helps reduce or heal climate trauma.

47
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,560
She says that research has found that people who have a strong community are more resilient

48
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,599
when bad things, like natural disasters, happen.

49
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,800
If you're resilient, you're able to get better more easily after something difficult or bad happens.

50
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,039
One person who had to be resilient is Brad Sherwood.

51
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:37,360
He survived a wildfire in Northern California in 2017 called the Tub Spire.

52
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,199
But when he returned home, his neighborhood was destroyed.

53
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,920
Brad started to volunteer for a local support network called After the Fire

54
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,000
to try to rebuild his community.

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,439
As he explained to BBC World Service Program, the climate question.

56
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,000
The silver lining in all this, if it wasn't for the Tub Spire,

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,399
we wouldn't be working as a community right now to build a new community plaza.

58
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:05,679
We were a close community before the Tub Spire,

59
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:09,599
but afterwards we are so much stronger and resilient.

60
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,039
I think our children are as well.

61
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:15,359
They can jump over any hurdle.

62
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,240
Brad says that the work to rebuild and improve his community is the silver lining to the fire.

63
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,079
The expression silver lining means a positive thing that comes from a negative situation.

64
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,639
Brad's community became more resilient after the fire, including the children.

65
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,919
He says that they can jump over any hurdle.

66
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,919
We can describe challenges or difficult things in life as hurdles.

67
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,039
And it's quite inspiring, I think, to hear how Brad has taken a bad situation

68
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,800
and tried to stay resilient.

69
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Now the organisation that Brad volunteer for after the fire are helping those impacted by the

70
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,600
fires in LA in January.

71
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:02,800
Which reminds me, I asked you Beth about the impacts of human-made climate change on the wildfires in LA in January.

72
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,000
And I said 10% more likely.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,879
Which was, I'm afraid the wrong answer, it was actually 35%.

74
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:11,680
Wow.

75
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,160
Okay, well let's recap the vocabulary we've learned starting with trauma,

76
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,160
which is what we call the very bad and long-lasting emotional effects of an event or experience.

77
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,439
If you're struck by an idea or something someone has said,

78
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,560
you find it particularly interesting or impressive.

79
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,639
If a community re-knits together, it becomes closer again.

80
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,639
And a close-knit community is where everyone looks after each other.

81
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,199
Resilient means able to get better more easily when bad things happen.

82
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,000
A silver lining is a positive thing that comes from a negative situation.

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,800
And we can describe challenges or difficult things in life as hurdles.

84
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:58,000
Once again, our six minutes are up, but why not try the interactive quiz on our websites to test what you've learnt?

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,560

88

Bye!
