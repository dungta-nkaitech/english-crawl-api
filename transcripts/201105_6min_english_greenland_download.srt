Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,640
And I'm Georgina.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,440
With no end in sight to the coronavirus pandemic, many people can't wait for the year 2020 to end.

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,720
But with the coronavirus dominating the newspaper headlines,

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,880
attention has moved away from an equally serious global issue, which has quietly been getting worse.

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,760
Climate change.

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:44,799
August 2020 saw the hottest temperature recorded anywhere in modern times, 54.4 degrees Celsius

9
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:50,960
in California's Death Valley. The same month also saw record amounts of ice melting into the oceans

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,520
around Greenland and the Arctic. Huge icebergs breaking away from the edge of the ice sheet.

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,600
A thick layer of ice which has covered a large area for a long time.

12
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,840
Greenland's ice sheet is three times the size of Texas at almost two kilometres thick.

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,840
Locked inside is enough water to raise sea levels by six metres.

14
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,079
But global heating and melting polar ice has many scientists asking whether it's now too late to stop.

15
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:20,959
Have we reached the point of no return?

16
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,400
In this programme, we'll be looking at the effects of climate change on the Arctic and asking if

17
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,959
it's too late to change. And learning some of the related vocabulary too.

18
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:36,640
Now Georgina, you mentioned record levels of ice melt in the North Pole that the scale is hard

19
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,039
to take in. The amounts are so big they're measured in gigatons. That's a billion metric tons.

20
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,280
Imagine a giant ice cube one kilometre by one kilometre by one kilometre.

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,480
So my quiz question is this how many gigatons of ice are now melting into the ocean every year.

22
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:04,480
Is it A 450 gigatons, B 500 gigatons or C 550 gigatons?

23
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,920
I'll take a guess at B 500 gigatons.

24
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:15,520
Okay Georgina, we'll find out later. Now, Glaciologists, Michaela King, has been monitoring

25
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,439
the melting of Arctic ice by satellite. Here she is answering a question from BBC World

26
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,879
Service Programme Science in Action on whether the destruction of the ice sheet is now unavoidable.

27
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,360
If we were to say, you define a tipping point as a shift from one like stable dynamic state

28
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,920
to another, this certainly meets that criteria because we are seeing now that the ice sheet was more

29
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,600
less in balance prior to 2000 where the amount of ice being drained from the glaciers was

30
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,560
approximately equal to what we were gaining on the surface via snow every year.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,280
Isis made from snow falling on greenlands, glaciers, large, slow moving masses of ice.

32
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,040
At the same time though, ice is also lost through melting.

33
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,719
These two processes of making and melting ice kept the ice level in balance,

34
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,759
having different parts or elements arranged in the correct proportions. Essentially,

35
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,039
the melting ice was replaced by newly frozen ice.

36
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,159
But now the glaciers are shrinking faster, the new ice is being accumulated,

37
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,680
and the situation may have reached a tipping point. The time at which a change or an effect

38
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,040
cannot be stopped. So does this mean that global heating and ice melting are now running

39
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,240
automatically separate from the amount of greenhouse gases humans are pumping into the atmosphere?

40
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,439
Does that mean we should just give up on the planet?

41
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:48,640
In fact, the situation is far from simple, as Michaela King explains here to BBC World Service Programme

42
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:57,200
Science in Action. We can definitely control the rate of mass loss, so it's definitely not a

43
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,480
throw your hands up and just not do anything about. Give up on the ice sheet kind of situation,

44
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,520
that's certainly not the message I want to send. But it does seem likely that we will continue

45
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:15,439
to lose mass, but of course, a slow rate of mass losses highly preferred to large annual losses

46
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:22,720
every year. Michaela thinks that changes in human activity can still slow the rate or speed at

47
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,120
which something happens. In this case, the speed of Greenland's ice sheet melting.

48
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,200
She's convinced it's not too late for collective action to save the planet, so it's not yet time

49
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,960
to throw your hands up, and idiom meaning to show frustration and despair when a situation becomes

50
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,520
so bad that you give up or submit. It's a positive message, but one which calls for everyone to do what

51
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:52,240
they can before it really is too late. Because the rate of ice melt is still increasing, right Neil?

52
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,400
Yes, that's right. In fact, that was my quiz question, Georgina, do you remember?

53
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,879
Yes, you asked me how many gigatons of Greenland's ice sheet are now melting every year. I said

54
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:11,040
be 500 gigatons. And you were? Correct. In fact, some of these giant ice cubes are like small towns

55
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,960
almost a kilometre tall. So there's still work to be done. In this program, we've been looking at the

56
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:23,680
rate or speed of ice melt in Greenland's ice sheet, the thick layer of ice covering a large area

57
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,519
of the Arctic. Previously, the melting ice was replaced by newly formed ice on glaciers,

58
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:35,359
large masses of slow moving ice. This kept the Arctic in balance, having different elements

59
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:41,120
arranged in proportion. But the effects of global heating have brought us close to a point of no

60
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,639
return called a tipping point, the time at which a change or an effect cannot be stopped.

61
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,759
The situation is serious, but there's still time to take action and not simply throw your hands up.

62
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,879
Show frustration and despair when you want to give up.

63
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,680
That's all for this program, but if you want to find out more about climate change in Greenland's

ice sheets, search BBC's Science and Action website. And for more trending topics and useful
