00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:12,320
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,800
And I'm Georgie. Would you like a cup of tea, Neil?

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,679
Oh, yes, thanks, Georgie. With milk and three sugars, please.

5
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:25,800
Three sugars? Wow, you really have a sweet tooth. You like eating sweet things.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,560
Aren't you worried about your weight?

7
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:34,920
Yes, but I can't say no to sugar. Just as our addiction to oil is causing a climate emergency,

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,079
our addiction to sugar is causing a health emergency for our bodies.

9
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:45,239
Sugar gives us an instant hit of the chemical hormone dopamine, making us feel good.

10
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,599
But in the long run, causing obesity, tooth decay and diseases like diabetes.

11
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:54,039
But how did our addiction to the sweet stuff begin?

12
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:58,359
That's what we'll be discussing in this programme, and as usual,

13
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,000
we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

14
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:05,400
Anyway, here's your tea, Neil. I just put one sugar.

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,039
Hmm, thanks, Georgie. I'll give it a try.

16
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:10,680
Now, before we go on, I have a question for you.

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,359
Sugar cane, which grows naturally in Asia, Africa and the Americas,

18
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:19,560
first came to England in the 11th century.

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,840
Back then, it was an expensive luxury item,

20
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,760
affordable only to kings, queens and the very rich.

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:33,159
So which English monarch loved eating sugar so much their teeth turned black?

22
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:39,480
Was it A, King Henry VIII, B, Queen Elizabeth I, or C, Mary Queen of Scots?

23
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,520
I know Henry VIII was very unhealthy, so I'll guess it's him.

24
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,040
Okay, Georgie, we'll find out the answer later in the programme.

25
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,800
Just now, I compared sugar to oil as the world's most important commodity.

26
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:59,240
A commodity is a product or natural resource that can be traded, bought and sold.

27
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,680
Today, economies, governments and wars are based on controlling oil,

28
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,800
but in earlier centuries, the same was true of sugar.

29
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,439
For 400 years, sugar, along with coffee and tobacco,

30
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:17,000
was grown in slavery plantations and shipped across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe.

31
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:25,239
By the time slavery was ended in 1834, the demand for sugar in Europe and the United States was at a record high.

32
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:29,879
Here's Professor of International History, Ulba Bosmer,

33
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:33,719
explaining more to BBC Radio 4 programme, thinking aloud.

34
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:39,799
The sugar was already an extremely important commodity in the 16th and 17th and 18th century,

35
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:47,239
and in the 19th century, we see a staggering growth of sugar consumption in Europe and the United States.

36
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:52,599
With that, sugar became the fuel for human bodies,

37
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:56,919
where oil became the fuel for vehicles in the 20th century.

38
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:02,120
Professor Bosmer talks about the staggering growth in the popularity of sugar.

39
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,879
The adjective staggering means shocking or surprising.

40
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:11,799
Just like oil became the fuel for machine engines, sugar became the fuel for the human body.

41
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:15,639
Fuel is a substance that is burned to provide heat or power.

42
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:19,879
Trading companies had become rich selling sugar grown using slave labour.

43
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,399
When people began to realise the health problems of sugar in the 20th century,

44
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:28,919
these companies needed new ways to sell their product,

45
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:33,159
and began using sugar in food which had previously contained none,

46
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,399
food like bread, cereal and yogurt.

47
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:41,560
Here's Professor Bosmer again, taking up the story for BBC Radio 4's thinking aloud.

48
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,280
You can flood the market with a certain commodity with sugar in this case,

49
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,400
but that still does not mean that people will consume it.

50
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,280
So the eating habits of people had to change.

51
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,960
People until the early 19th century, they had a few spoons of sugar per week,

52
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,280
but not a kilo which people consume today in many countries in the world.

53
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,719
Sugar companies flooded the market with their commodity.

54
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:10,120
If you flood the market, you make a lot of your product available for sale,

55
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,400
often at a low price.

56
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,680
But just because something is cheap and easily available doesn't mean people will eat it.

57
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:23,240
So sugar companies try to increase sugar consumption by changing people's eating habits,

58
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,000
the way a group of people eat.

59
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,199
For example, which types of food they eat, how much of it and how often?

60
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,160
Instead of one or two spoons of sugar per week,

61
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,959
people started eating kilos with results we see around us every day,

62
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:42,680
worldwide obesity and heart disease have tripled in the last 50 years.

63
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,680
What's more, because sugary food is cheaper, it's often the poorest in society who are worst affected.

64
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,159
Maybe it's time to try having your tea without any sugar, Aineel.

65
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:59,000
And to reveal the answer to your question, which English monarch's famous love of sugar turned

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,959
their teeth black, I guess it was the notorious overeeter Henry VIII.

67
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:07,479
Which was the wrong answer I'm afraid Georgie.

68
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:10,680
In fact, during the years before toothpaste and dentist,

69
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,279
those black, stumpy teeth belong to Queen Elizabeth I.

70
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:19,240
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this program about sugar,

71
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,639
starting with a sweet tooth, a fondness for eating sweet sugary food and drinks.

72
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,759
A commodity is a product or natural resource that can be traded, bought and sold.

73
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:35,719
Fuel is a substance such as oil or coal that is burned to provide heat or power.

74
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:40,120
The adjective staggering means very shocking and surprising.

75
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,319
If a company floods the market, they release a lot of a particular product for sale

76
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:51,879
often at a low price. And finally, eating habits describe the way a particular group of people eat,

77
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:56,120
for example, which types of food they eat, how much and how often.
