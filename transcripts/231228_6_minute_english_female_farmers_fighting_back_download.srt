6-Mute English from BBCLearningEnglish.com

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,679
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,800
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,080
If you've ever tried growing vegetables, you'll know it's not easy.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,480
They need water, soil, and plenty of sunlight.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,839
Plus, you have to keep away weeds and insects.

7
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,440
But in some countries, female farmers face a different problem

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,560
growing and selling vegetables. Sexism.

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,600
The mistreatment of one sex, based on the belief that the other is better,

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,079
usually that men are better than women.

11
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:45,079
According to the United Nations, over 40% of farmers globally are women,

12
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:51,760
a number which rises to almost 50% in lower and middle-income countries.

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,200
Although these women manage farms, look after crops and sell their produce at market,

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:04,200
female farmers face sexism in societies where women are expected to raise children and stay at home.

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:10,159
In this programme, we'll be digging into ideas helping female farmers in Bangladesh and Peru

16
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,159
to earn a fair price for the food they grow.

17
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:17,600
And as usual, you'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,000
But first, I have a question for you, Beth.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,079
According to the UN's World Food Programme, or WFP,

20
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,920
what is the world's most popular vegetable?

21
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,640
Is it A, onions, B, tomatoes or C, peppers?

22
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,760
I think the answer is tomatoes.

23
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,640
OK, Beth, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

24
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,960
Poppy farms a small garden in rural Bangladesh,

25
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,719
where she grows cucumbers, spinach and okra.

26
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,280
Although around half of Bangladesh farmers are female,

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,960
they're not always welcome at the marketplace,

28
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,320
where they face harassment or are underpaid for their produce.

29
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:01,879
Now Poppy has joined hundreds of other female farmers using a new online app.

30
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:05,280
The e-commerce platform is called Farm to Go,

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,599
and farmers can sell their produce without revealing their identity,

32
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,280
thereby getting a fair price than at the market.

33
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,680
Here's Poppy telling more to Salman Saeed,

34
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,479
reporter for BBC World Service programme People Fixing the World.

35
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:27,399
By selling here, we get more profit.

36
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:32,000
For example, if we sell a product in the market at 30 Takas,

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,120
we can sell that here at 32 or 33 Takas.

38
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,079
That's what makes us very happy.

39
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,799
It also saves time.

40
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:45,039
As after selling the product, we can come home and spend time with the families

41
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,120
and can also work in the vegetable garden.

42
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,680
33 Takas is about 30 US cents,

43
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,039
with 300 women currently using the app in Bangladesh.

44
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:59,480
And while the three cents extra might sound small,

45
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,560
over the course of the year, as Thrice's fluctuate,

46
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,400
the WPC, the average monthly revenue for each farmer

47
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,159
using the app has risen dramatically.

48
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,719
In the long run, the hope is that it will also be possible

49
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,759
to challenge and change attitudes around gender,

50
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,560
but in the meantime, the extra money she makes per cell

51
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,759
makes a big difference to Poppy and her family.

52
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:28,479
Although the app only increases Poppy's profits a little,

53
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,759
they soon add up because vegetable prices fluctuate.

54
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,000
They continually change, moving up and down.

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,159
According to the WFP, the incomes of farmers using the app

56
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,759
have risen dramatically.

57
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:43,959
They've increased suddenly and surprisingly.

58
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,759
That makes a big difference to Poppy,

59
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:49,039
to make a big difference is an idiom

60
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,879
meaning to significantly improve a situation.

61
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,079
It's good news for female farmers in Bangladesh,

62
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:59,439
but problems continue in many other places,

63
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,799
often because it's the man in the family

64
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,319
who controls the household finances.

65
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,039
Here, reporter Craig Langerin explains a finance scheme

66
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,639
helping female coffee growers in Peru

67
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,000
to BBC World Service Programme people fixing the world.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,160
So I came across a project in Peru recently

69
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,800
and they're helping female coffee growers to access finance.

70
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,319
So how it works, it's a type of savings and credit union

71
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,319
and people living nearby can each chip in a small amount of money

72
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:30,319
which can then be accessed by a farmer

73
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,680
if she needs a loan to say buy a new bean processing machine

74
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,680
or something like that.

75
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,920
Female farmers in Peru have started a savings and credit union.

76
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,079
This is a kind of cooperative bank

77
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,319
when members pull their savings together

78
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,479
so they can lend funds to each other.

79
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,079
Each member chips in,

80
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,120
everyone gives a small amount of money

81
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,560
to pay for something together.

82
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,399
Getting back to vegetables,

83
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:56,959
I think it's time to reveal the answer to my question, Beth.

84
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,279
According to the UN,

85
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:01,799
what is the world's most popular vegetable?

86
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:03,919
I guess it was tomatoes.

87
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,240
Which was the correct answer.

88
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,839
Technically a fruit nutritionists count tomato as a vegetable.

89
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:14,000
In fact, the most commonly used vegetable in the world.

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,359
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this program

91
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,199
on female farmers battling sexism.

92
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,479
That's the mistreatment of one sex based on the belief

93
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:25,159
that the other one is better.

94
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,159
Usually that men are better than women.

95
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:30,000
If something fluctuates, it keeps changing,

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,319
moving up and down.

97
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:37,000
To rise dramatically means to increase in a sudden and surprising way.

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,199
The EDM to make a big difference

99
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,199
means to significantly improve a situation.

100
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,360
A savings and credit union is a cooperative bank

101
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,680
where members pull their savings together

102
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,879
so they can borrow money from each other.

103
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:52,120
And finally, if you chip in,

104
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,759
you contribute some money

105
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,199
so a group of you can pay for something together.

106
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,480
