00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And I'm Beth. London has many tourist attractions from Big Ben to Buckingham Palace.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Would it surprise you to hear that many tourist-top destination is actually a museum?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The British Museum contains thousands of important artifacts, objects of special historical interest,

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
including ancient Egyptian mummies, an Aztec serpent and the Rosetta stone.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
In fact, London has museums on every subject from trains to fashion.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But recently, many museums have been criticised for stealing ancient treasures during Imperial times,

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
the age of the British Empire. Many argue that these treasures, such as the famous Parthenon marbles and Ben in Bruns', should be returned.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
In this programme, we'll discuss the controversial role of museums in the 21st century and, as usual,

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But first, I have a question for you, Beth.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Another of London's most visited museums, the Natural History Museum, features a grand entrance hall,

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
which, for decades, contained an impressive life-size model of a dinosaur.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But what was this iconic dinosaur's name?

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Was it a, Dippy the Diplodocus, B, Terry the Terradactyl, or C, Tyrone the Terranosaurus?

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I think the answer is Dippy the Diplodocus.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay, Beth, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Anthropologist Professor Adam Cooper has written a new book, The Museum of Other People,

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
which discusses the idea that many museum artefacts were stolen and should be given back.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Here he speaks to BBC Radio 4 programme, Thinking Allowed, about two sides of the debate,

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
one which saw European culture as superior and another which didn't.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
These are the two great ideologies of the imperial age.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The one is that all societies begin from a very rough base.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You know, all our ancestors will hunt a gatherer as at one stage.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And then they go through the stage of farming industry all this while they're getting smarter and smarter.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Their brains are getting bigger and bigger, and they're moving from primitive magic to sophisticated religion,

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and maybe onto science, so it's onwards and upwards.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That's the imperial idea, and we're going to help these other poor benign people up the lever with us.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And opposed to this, there's this other 19th century ideology which says, no,

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
this is an imperialist myth, we have our own culture.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
There are no better or worse cultures, there are just national cultures.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Imperialists believed that mankind progressed through stages, starting as hunter-gatherers,

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
people who lived before the invention of farming and survived by hunting and collecting food in the wild.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
According to this view, white European culture was best because it was the most advanced,

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
so it was their duty to help local cultures up the ladder, meaning to advance or make progress.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Adam Cooper uses the phrase onwards and upwards to describe a situation where things are improving,

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
becoming better and better.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Of course, things didn't get better for everyone, especially the people whose land and possessions were stolen.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
An opposing view argued that each culture is unique and should be valued and protected.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The legacy of colonialism is now being publicly debated, but the question of returning stolen artifact remains complex.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Firstly, since many of these treasures are hundreds of years old, who should they be returned to?

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What's more, the history behind these objects is complicated.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
In the case of the Ben and Bruns' for example, questions can be asked about the actions of local leaders as well as the European powers.

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So how can museums display their artifacts to reflect this complex history?

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Here's Professor Cooper sharing his ideas with BBC Radio 4's thinking aloud.

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I want to see a lot more temporary exhibitions and the kinds of exhibitions that I would interested in are not about one particular tradition,

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
but about the relationships between different cultural traditions.

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Everything is interconnected. Of course, these connections are sometimes violent, sometimes oppressive, sometimes very difficult, sometimes very painful, but things are changing.

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
An exhibition is a display showing a collection of artifacts.

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Adam Cooper wants exhibitions to tell truthful stories by showing the relationships between cultures and how events are interconnected or related to each other.

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And these stories must include all cultures going back almost to the dinosaurs.

54
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And speaking of dinosaurs, Neil, it's time for you to reveal the answer to your question.

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What was the name of the famous dinosaur which greeted visitors to London's Natural History Museum?

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I said it was Dippy the Diplodicus.

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Which was the correct answer?

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The 26-meter-long dinosaur was displayed from 1905 until 2017 when it was replaced by the skeleton of a female blue whale, promisingly named Hope.

59
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned starting with Artifact, an object of historical significance.

60
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Hunter Gatherers were people who lived by hunting and collecting wild food rather than farming.

61
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If someone moves up the ladder, they advance or make progress.

62
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The phrase onwards and upwards describes a situation where things are getting better and better.

63
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
An exhibition is a display of artifacts in a museum or paintings in an art gallery.

64
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And finally, the adjective interconnected describes separate things which are connected or related to each other.

65
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Once again, our time is up. Join us again soon for more trending topics. Goodbye everyone.

66
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Bye!
