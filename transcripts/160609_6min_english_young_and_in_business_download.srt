00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,359
Hello and welcome to 6MuteEnglish. I'm Alice.

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,399
And I'm Rob.

7
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,000
So Rob, did you have a part-time job while you were at university?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,800
Ah yes, I worked in the student bar.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
Did you learn anything from the experience?

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,039
I learned how to pull a decent pint.

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,960
Did you learn anything else?

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,359
Yes, I learned how to add up.

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,120
Didn't they teach you that at school?

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,200
I wasn't good at doing sums in my head, you know, mental arithmetic.

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,000
But I got pretty good at it as a barman.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,439
They didn't have computerised cash registers in my day, you see?

17
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,079
Oh, I didn't realise you were that old, Rob.

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,600
Anyway, the subject of today's show is young business entrepreneurs.

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,079
So, can you answer this question?

20
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,040
How young were the founders of Facebook and Microsoft

21
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,359
when they first set up their companies?

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,479
Were they, hey, junior high school students?

23
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:05,439
B, high school students?

24
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,000
Or C, university students?

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,480
And Alice, in case you think I don't know,

26
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,439
Facebook is an online social networking service

27
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,319
and Microsoft is a computer software company, okay?

28
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,000
Very good, well done.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,480
Well, I'm going to say they were B, high school students.

30
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,079
Well, we'll find out if you chose the right answer later on in the programme.

31
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,799
But let's talk now about what drawbacks or disadvantages

32
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,640
there are for young entrepreneurs.

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,840
What do you think, Rob?

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,400
Well, I suppose one of the drawbacks of being young and your own boss

35
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,519
is that everyone who works for you is older than you.

36
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,879
Is that a drawback?

37
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:45,359
Well, let's consider a real case.

38
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:51,519
Young British entrepreneur Sulaman Sakhani started his first company when he was 17,

39
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,319
followed by another business shortly afterwards.

40
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,359
Then while studying chemistry at university,

41
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,759
he started his third company, an online version of the pound shop,

42
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,519
or dollar store in the US,

43
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,879
where everything in the shop is priced at one pound.

44
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,400
Let's listen to Sulaman Sakhani talking about his company.

45
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:14,639
I'm actually quite fortunate now compared to what I was six months ago,

46
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,959
because now I've got two additional directors of Greyhair.

47
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,639
And it actually, commercial meetings are excellent now, you know?

48
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,679
But before that, I think I came across quite professional,

49
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,919
but you could still tell they were thinking in the back of their heads,

50
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,199
got kids sitting in front of me.

51
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:36,959
So young entrepreneur Sulaman Sakhani has got two Greyhair directors working with him now.

52
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,079
That's right.

53
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:41,759
But how does having Greyhair executives on board help, Rob?

54
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,560
Well, executives are people who run a business,

55
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,439
and on board means being part of a team.

56
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,359
Well, to answer your question, Alice, they bring experience to the table.

57
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,599
I have a few Greyhairs, you know?

58
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,960
You could learn a lot from me.

59
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,960
Oh, I do, Rob, every day.

60
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,520
And if you bring something to the table,

61
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,240
it means you provide something useful.

62
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,400
Well, what do you bring to the table, Rob?

63
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,439
Well, bad jokes, peanuts, crisps, cups of coffee, that sort of thing.

64
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,319
I was going to say a keen mind,

65
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,479
in other words, a well-developed mind,

66
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,879
and great business acumen.

67
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,719
Oh, come on, you aren't going to say that.

68
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,240
You're right, I wasn't.

69
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,479
Acumen means good judgment,

70
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,719
but don't worry, you have an abundant enthusiasm that makes up for it.

71
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,919
But moving on now, do you think that school prepared you well for working life?

72
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:35,599
No, not really. I studied Latin at school, and I don't use that much.

73
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,519
And maths, well, I never use trigonometry or calculus.

74
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,319
So I'm not sure how useful maths lessons were.

75
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,240
Mmm, yes, and you only learn to add up in the university bar after all.

76
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,480
Yes, but I'm very good at it.

77
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,600
And the point is that I've got a fantastic job now.

78
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,760
And if you're really interested in something,

79
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,600
you can always acquire or get the skills you don't have.

80
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,280
Let's listen to successful young entrepreneur, Jessica Rose,

81
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,200
talking about her experience.

82
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,040
She works with jewelry.

83
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,719
I didn't need all these previous skills and experience to go out there and start on my own.

84
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,240
When I first started, I had no business training whatsoever,

85
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,400
no jewelry training whatsoever.

86
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,720
But I kind of broke up one day and thought,

87
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,879
I'd really love to be a jewelry designer,

88
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,319
which is kind of a tricky position to be in because it's, you know,

89
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:26,480
a lot of people would say and did say,

90
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,160
well, you're, you know, your mad.

91
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,519
So Jessica Rose used her savings to learn jewelry making,

92
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,800
and then set up her own jewelry making business.

93
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,680
And despite setting out with no business experience and no jewelry training,

94
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,400
her enthusiasm for the article paid off.

95
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,879
And that means it was successful.

96
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,240
A bit like me.

97
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,959
Yes.

98
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,720
Okay, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question.

99
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,560
I asked how young were the founders of Facebook and Microsoft

100
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,960
when they first set up their companies?

101
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,399
Were they a junior high school students,

102
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,439
b, high school students,

103
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,079
or c, university students?

104
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,039
I said b, high school students.

105
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,680
And you were wrong, I'm afraid.

106
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,319
Rob, sorry.

107
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:14,959
Again.

108
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:15,519
Yes.

109
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,439
Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates were both university students

110
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,279
when they started their companies.

111
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,799
Zuckerberg was studying at Harvard in the US when he launched Facebook in 2004.

112
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:31,919
And Bill Gates took a break from Harvard to launch Microsoft in 1976,

113
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,919
but never returned to his studies.

114
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,479
Yeah, both at Harvard, that's a coincidence.

115
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,600
I wonder if the bar there was any good.

116
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,720
Now, can we hear the words we learned today?

117
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,920
Yes, okay.

118
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,920
They are drawbacks, executives,

119
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,920
on board, bring something to the table,

120
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,480
keen, business acumen, acquire, paid off.

121
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,480
Thanks, Alice.

122
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,840
Well, that's the end of today's six minute English.

123
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,199
We hope you've enjoyed the new vocabulary that we brought to the table.

124
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,079
Very good.

125
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,439
Please don't ask again soon.

126
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,079
Bye-bye.

127
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,319
Bye.
