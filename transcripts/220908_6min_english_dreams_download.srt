00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And I'm Beth.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
When I was a boy, I wanted to be a fireman when I grew up.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
How about you, Beth? Did you have any childhood dreams?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I wanted to be an astronaut and fly to the moon.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
When we're young, most of us have big dreams and plans for the future.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Unfortunately, as we grow up, these childhood dreams often get lost in the adult world of jobs, money, families and careers.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But not for everyone.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Daisy, from New Zealand and Herman from Argentina, are two people who decided to follow their childhood dreams.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
They wanted the world to become a utopia, a perfect, ideal society where everyone is happy and gets along with each other.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:12,000
In this programme, we'll be hearing how Daisy and Herman made their dreams come true, not by changing the world, but by changing themselves.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And as usual, we'll be learning some new vocabulary too.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But before that, I have a question for you, Beth. Following your dreams can be tough, but not following them can you?

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Not following them can leave you regretting all the things you wanted to do, but didn't.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:39,000
In 2012, Australian nurse Bronny Ware wrote her bestselling book, The Top 5 Regrets of the Dying, after interviewing terminally ill patients about their life regrets.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So, what do you think their top regret was?

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Was it A, I wish I hadn't worked so hard?

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
B, I wish I had followed my dreams or C, I wish I'd made more money.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Well, I'll guess it's B, they wish they'd followed their dreams.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay, Beth, I'll reveal the correct answer at the end of the programme.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The first dreamer we're going to meet lives in Riverside, a peace loving community in New Zealand where everyone shares everything.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Riverside members work for the community's businesses, including a farm, a hotel and a cafe.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
All the money they earn is collected and shared between everyone equally.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Daisy, who was born in East Germany, joined Riverside in 2004.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Here she explains her belief in sharing to BBC World Service programme, The Documentary.

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What I think I always believed in is that the sharing of resources can provide a group of people with quite a great advantage,

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
but it doesn't matter how many hours you work or what work you do, everyone is getting the same amount.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And there is something that many people outside of Riverside really struggle with and where they are often getting this communism label attached to us.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Because it seems so outlandish for people.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Riverside isn't a communist community.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
In fact, people with many different political views live there.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But Daisy says that local people struggle with the idea that everything is shared.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
If you struggle with an idea, you find it difficult to accept or think about it.

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Daisy also says some local people call Riverside outlandish, strange and unusual.

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Our second group of dreamers are a family, the Zaps.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:44,000
In 2000, childhood sweethearts, Herman and Candelaria Zap bought a vintage car and set off from Argentina to travel around the world with less than $3,500 in their pockets.

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:55,000
22 years and three children later, they have visited over a hundred countries, meeting with countless people and experiences on the way.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Here, Herman Zap explains to BBC World Services the documentary, how following his dream has changed him for the better.

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I am so happy with the Herman. There is now that I know now.

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's not the one who wanted to conquer the world, but the one who was conquered by the world.

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I learned so much from people.

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's amazing how the more you meet people, the more you know story, how much more humble you become.

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You notice that you are a beautiful tiny piece of sand, but I am very important piece of sand like everyone is, right?

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:38,000
After many years traveling, meeting new people and hearing their stories, Herman is more humble, not proud or arrogant.

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He no longer wants to conquer the world to control it by force, rather he has been conquered by his experiences.

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Herman compares himself to a beautiful but tiny piece of sand and uses the phrase, a grain of sand, to describe things which are insignificant in themselves, but at the same time are an important part of the whole.

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Daisy and Herman are rare examples of dreamers who follow their dream and found a happy life lived without regret, which reminds me of your question, Neil.

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yes, I asked about Brony Wears book, The Top 5 Regrets of the Dying.

51
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What do you think the number one regret was, Beth?

52
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I guess it was B, not following your dreams.

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Which was the right answer.

54
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Not having the courage to follow your dreams was listed as the top life regret.

55
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
At least we have people like Daisy and Herman to remind us dreams can come true.

56
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from this programme, starting with Utopia, a perfect world where everyone is happy.

57
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If you struggle with an idea, you find it difficult to accept.

58
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The adjective outlandish means strange and unusual.

59
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
To conquer something means to control it by force.

60
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Someone who is humble is not proud or arrogant.

61
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Similarly, the phrase, a grain of sand, describes something which is both insignificant yet somehow important.

62
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Once again, our six minutes are up.

63
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Bye for now.

64
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Goodbye.
