4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,199
Hi, I'm Rob and welcome to 6 Minute English where we talk about an interesting topic

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,519
and six items of related vocabulary.

6
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,199
And I'm Neil and today we're talking about wetticket.

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,480
What's that, Rob?

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,600
I have no idea.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,719
Well, you won't find wetticket in many dictionaries.

10
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:31,839
It actually means swimming pool etiquette.

11
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:33,439
W etiquette.

12
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,479
Get it?

13
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:40,640
etiquette is a set of rules for how to behave in social situations and wetticket is a set of

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,079
do's and don'ts to keep things calm in the water.

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,239
Do's and don'ts are also rules telling us how to behave.

16
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,560
So things like no running by the pool or no diving in the shallow end.

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,359
Am I right?

18
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:55,120
Yes and no, Rob.

19
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,159
Those are traditional swimming pool rules, but wetticket covers slightly different things.

20
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay, well, before we get to those, I have a question for you, Neil.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,359
According to the US Water Quality and Health Council,

22
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,359
how many people admitted to not showering before using the pool?

23
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:16,560
Is it a 7%, b 17% or c 70%?

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,159
Well, I'm going to be optimistic and say 7%, Rob.

25
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,319
Ah, so I take it, you do always take a shower before swimming, Neil.

26
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,279
Correct.

27
00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:30,959
Taking a quick shower is such an easy thing to do and it stops all that horrible sweat and bacteria

28
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,319
getting in the pool water.

29
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,039
I can't understand why some people don't do it.

30
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:39,919
I can see it's making you quite hot under the collar and that means angry.

31
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:44,319
Let's listen to swimming specialist Jenny Landruth talking about what a noise her.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm very keen on my wetticket.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,799
Is that thing where people get quite cross about, which is do you gain around clockwise or anticlockwise?

34
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,319
Do you overtake or not?

35
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,280
People need a rule.

36
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,319
We need to observe the rules of the pool and I'm very keen on that and most other swimmers

37
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,640
will suffer from lane rage if people are in the wrong lane of the pool and don't know how to

38
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,799
observe the rules of that lane.

39
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,639
Lane rage, you mean if you're a kind of slow swimmer and you dare to go in the fast swimmer?

40
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,960
Well, I hate to say it but it is quite often that gentlemen quite often misjudge their speed

41
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,719
and think they're slightly faster than me.

42
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,919
Ah, the male ego, yeah.

43
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,960
They quite often don't like it if there's a woman swimming faster than them.

44
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,879
So very often they'll go in the slightly faster lane and should be gently encouraged by wetticket

45
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,080
to get into the correct lane.

46
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,280
No, your speed, I don't have speed.

47
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,520
Yeah.

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:29,680
Yes.

49
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,760
That was Jenny Landruth, a swimming specialist talking about the things that annoy her about other

50
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,120
people in the pool.

51
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,600
Yes, Jenny doesn't like it when people are slower than they should be for the fast lane.

52
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:46,159
Older men like you, Rob.

53
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,520
Neil, how dare you.

54
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,319
Yes, Jenny gets lane rage.

55
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,280
Lane rage, where swimmers get hot under the collar when there's a slow swimmer in the fast lane.

56
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,120
Swimmy lanes are the vertical sections of a swimming pool that are often labeled as fast,

57
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,159
medium and slow.

58
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,159
Do you know your speed, Neil?

59
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,439
Yes, I'm fast.

60
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,879
Ah, are you sure you're not to misjudging your speed?

61
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,920
Do you think you might actually be a medium fast swimmer?

62
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,560
To misjudge means to guess something wrongly.

63
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,719
And our ego is the idea we have of ourselves with regards to how important we feel we are.

64
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,640
And to answer your question, Rob.

65
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,560
No, I'm definitely fast.

66
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,360
Are there other things Swimmers should be aware of in the pool?

67
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,759
Yes.

68
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,159
If somebody taps your foot, it means they want to overtake you.

69
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,800
Ah, overtaking means to pass another person travelling in the same direction

70
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,480
because you are going faster than them.

71
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,719
I hate it when swimmers overtake me.

72
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,199
Really, Neil, is that your male ego talking?

73
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,079
No, not at all.

74
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,599
I just hate getting splashed.

75
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,560
I see.

76
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,519
Well, perhaps now is a good time to move on and hear the answer to today's quiz question.

77
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,159
Remember, I asked how many people admitted to not showering before using the pool?

78
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,639
Is it a 7%, b 17% or c 70%.

79
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,359
I said 7% and I hope I'm right.

80
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:06,959
Well, I'm afraid your wrong, Neil.

81
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,120
It's actually 10 times that amount.

82
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,399
It's 70%.

83
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,599
Ugh.

84
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,840
The 2012 US report from Water Quality and Health Council

85
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,720
found that around 70% of people do not shower before taking a swim in the pool,

86
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,120
adding to the number of germs in the water.

87
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,280
Perhaps swimming pools should start finding people who don't take a shower.

88
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,800
That might make a difference.

89
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,759
Now, let's go over the words we learned today.

90
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,319
Yes, the first one is Doos and Don'ts,

91
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,079
which are rules telling us how to behave in a particular situation.

92
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,439
For example, what are the Doos and Don'ts of meeting the queen?

93
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,479
Good question.

94
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,759
Is the correct etiquette to call her your highness or ma'am?

95
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,120
Are there certain subjects you shouldn't talk about?

96
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,120
Do you shake a hand or curtsy?

97
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,439
These are things you need to know or else the queen might get hot under the collar.

98
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,399
That's our next word and it means angry.

99
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,159
Both politicians got hot under the collar and insulted each other.

100
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:04,479
Okay, number three is lanes,

101
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,040
which are the vertical sections of a swimming pool that are often labeled as fast,

102
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,640
medium and slow.

103
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,000
Our British Olympic gold medalist is swimming in lane one.

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,920
Our next word is misjudge, which means to guess something wrongly.

105
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,800
For example, I'm sorry I misjudged you, Rob.

106
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,080
Please forgive me.

107
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,759
Oh, all right, then Neil.

108
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,240
But don't misjudge me again, okay?

109
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,800
Next up is ego, which is our sense of how important we are.

110
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,360
Losing the race was a huge blow to her ego.

111
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,400
And our final word is overtake, which means to pass another person traveling in the same

112
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,360
direction because you are going faster than them.

113
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,560
I don't enjoy overtaking big lorries on the motorway.

114
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,600
Neither do I, Neil.

115
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,759
Now, one of the dos and don'ts of this show is not talking for more than six minutes.

116
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,360
So it's time to say goodbye.

117
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,360
But please visit our Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages and tell us what makes you hot under the

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,080
collar.

119
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,800
And remember, you can explore our website, BBCLearningEnglish.com,

120
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,520
where you'll find guides to grammar, exercises, videos and articles to read,

121
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,360
and improve your English.

122
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,560
Bye-bye, goodbye.
