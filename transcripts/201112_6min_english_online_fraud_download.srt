00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,199
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,240
And I'm Georgina.

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,480
Are you good at remembering your computer passwords, Georgina?

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,719
Not really, Neil. I mostly use something easy to remember,

9
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:28,240
like my mother's major name,

10
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:29,759
or the street where I was born.

11
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:33,039
Or the name of your first pet, yes, me too.

12
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,320
But we should be more careful about online security, Georgina,

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,119
because of a worrying trend and the topic of this programme, online fraud.

14
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:46,320
Online fraud involves using the internet to trick someone into giving away their money or data.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,079
It takes many forms from deceptive emails which trick us into paying money to the wrong bank account,

16
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,079
to the theft of credit card details.

17
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,759
It's regarded by some as a highly profitable and relatively low-risk crime,

18
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:05,519
so in this programme we'll be finding out why it's so easy for criminals or fraudsters to steal our money.

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,000
And of course, we'll be learning some relative vocabulary along the way.

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,719
But first, it's time for our quiz question.

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,719
In July, 2029 British men were arrested for defrauding the coronavirus job retention scheme,

22
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,400
a government fund for workers who've lost their job to COVID-19.

23
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:29,039
They set up fake companies and applied fraudulently for money.

24
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:34,400
But how much money has been claimed in total through the coronavirus job scheme in the UK?

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:42,640
Is it a 17 billion pounds, b 27 billion pounds, or c 37 billion pounds?

26
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,400
It must be a lot, so I'll say a 17 billion pounds.

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,760
Okay, Georgina will find out later.

28
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,440
Now, Rachel Tobak, CEO of Social Proof Security, is an expert in cybercrime.

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,320
She describes herself as an ethical fraudster.

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,560
Businesses wanting to combat fraud employ her to hack into their computer systems to find their weak spots.

31
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,439
Here, Rachel explains to BBC World Service programme The Inquiry,

32
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,800
how getting people's information is the key to online fraud.

33
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,880
The reason why we're able to do that from an attacker mindset is because we use what's called

34
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,200
Ocent, open source intelligence.

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,360
We look up everything about you.

36
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,040
We can figure out who your assistant is, who your accountant is on LinkedIn.

37
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,520
We know what emails you use from screenshots that you've put on your Instagram.

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,760
Rachel looks at fraud from a criminal's mindset, someone's way of thinking and the general attitudes

39
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,520
and opinions they have about something.

40
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,320
From a fraudster's perspective, the most valuable thing is intelligence.

41
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,040
Secret information about a government or country or in this case a person,

42
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,560
such as the information people unwittingly post on social media.

43
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,000
fraudsters use this intelligence to build up a picture of someone's online activity.

44
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,960
And as BBC World Service The Inquiry presenter, Shama Incosia explains,

45
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,719
there are many ways of doing this.

46
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,719
Fraudsters have thousands of cover stories but the end goal is always the same,

47
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,280
to trick people out of cash or possessions.

48
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,039
Rachel says they have options for how to do that.

49
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,719
Login details stolen during a data breach from one company,

50
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:29,199
often using software or viruses called malware are used to infiltrate customer accounts at another.

51
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,800
To access people's data, fraudsters use cover stories.

52
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,520
False stories told in order to hide the truth.

53
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,600
For example, they may pretend to be calling from your bank or credit card company.

54
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,520
If people believe these cover stories and share personal data,

55
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,760
this can result in a data breach.

56
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,560
An occasion when private information can be seen by people who should not be able to see it.

57
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:56,640
Malware, computer software and viruses that are designed to damage the way a computer works,

58
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,920
can also be used to gain login details and passwords.

59
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,840
Data which is then used to infiltrate other online accounts,

60
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,120
secretly enter a place, group or organization in order to spy on it or influence it.

61
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,039
Modern fraudsters are so devious at collecting online information that many victims only realize

62
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,840
what's happened after their bank accounts have been emptied,

63
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,399
which I guess was the mindset behind those British fraudsters you mentioned earlier, Neil.

64
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,840
Ah yes, the nine men who tried to defraud the coronavirus jobs retention scheme.

65
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,439
Remember for my quiz question, I asked you how much the scheme has paid out in total so far in the UK.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,959
I said a 17 billion pounds.

67
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,719
Well, in fact, it's even more the correct answer is b 27 billion pounds.

68
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:48,159
Luckily, the Â£495,000 which these fraudsters tried to steal was recovered.

69
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,959
Even so, Neil, I think I'm going to change my password soon.

70
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,079
Better safe than sorry.

71
00:04:54,719 --> 00:04:56,000
Good idea Georgina.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,919
In this program, we've been hearing about the rise in online fraud,

73
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,959
often committed when fraudsters gain intelligence.

74
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,839
Secret information about a person posted on the internet.

75
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:12,959
These criminals mindset or mentality is to surreptitially find information by creating a cover story,

76
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,919
a full story someone tells in order to hide the truth.

77
00:05:16,799 --> 00:05:20,879
By posing as clerks from your bank, for example, they might be able to access

78
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,479
sensitive private information, which they should not be able to see,

79
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,719
an event sometimes called a data breach.

80
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,079
Another way fraudsters infiltrate or gain access secretly without permission

81
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,000
is with the use of malware.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,240
Computer software and viruses designed to damage the way a computer works.

83
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,039
If you want to find out more about keeping yourself safe from online fraud,

84
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,800
