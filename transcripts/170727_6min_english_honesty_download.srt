5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,200
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English,

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,879
where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary.

7
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:18,800
I'm Neil and joining me is Rob.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,760
Hello there.

9
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,719
And today we've got six minutes to talk about honesty

10
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:24,879
and how honest people are,

11
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,519
particularly when it comes to spending money.

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,679
So Neil, what's an honesty box?

13
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:31,359
Well, it's where you pay for something

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,039
by putting money in a box,

15
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,640
but it's up to you to put in the right amount.

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,719
A small business might use this method

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,439
to take money for things like parking your car

18
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:42,719
or buying a newspaper

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,920
because it means you don't need a sales assistant.

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,120
Hmm, but that means people could take a newspaper

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,079
or park their car without paying anything.

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,439
An honesty box relies on people being honest.

23
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,600
The adjective honest means truthful

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,200
and not trying to cheat people.

25
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,880
And the noun is honesty,

26
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,880
the quality of being truthful.

27
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,879
Have you ever cheated an honesty box, Rob?

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,960
Ha, absolutely not. I never have.

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,000
Honestly.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,280
Honestly.

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,400
And to cheat, by the way,

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,320
means to trick or deceive someone

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,760
to get something you want.

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,960
Honesty is the best policy, as they say.

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,079
Which, of course, leads us onto our quiz.

36
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,240
The 6 Minute English Quiz.

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,680
Who said honesty is the best policy?

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,640
Was it A, Donald Trump?

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,799
B, Benjamin Franklin, or C, Richard Nixon?

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,200
Honestly, Neil, everyone will know the answer to that.

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,439
Ah, but do you know the answer to that, Rob?

42
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,000
Well, I'll have an honest guess.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,159
I think it's B, Benjamin Franklin.

44
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,439
Well, you might be right,

45
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,519
but you might not. We'll find out at the end.

46
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,319
I did like your use of honesty there, Rob.

47
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:50,079
We can use the adverb, honestly,

48
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,359
at the beginning of a sentence

49
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:53,519
to show that we're feeling irritated.

50
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,079
For example, when your co-presenter picks a quiz question,

51
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:56,960
that's too easy.

52
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:57,919
Okay, okay.

53
00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:00,640
Let's move on now and hear from Philip Graves,

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,239
a psychologist and author of the book, Consumerology,

55
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,000
who can tell us about why honesty isn't always the best policy.

56
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,799
The question is not our most consumers honest.

57
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:12,719
The question is our most people honest,

58
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,240
and the answer to that is no.

59
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,359
We have evolved with the capacity to be dishonest.

60
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:20,719
It's part of our evolutionary psychological makeup,

61
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,439
because if we can gain an advantage over the people around us,

62
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,120
we have a greater chance of surviving.

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
Now, what's important in that

64
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,400
is that we also benefit from being in a social group,

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,639
and that was important in our evolutionary past.

66
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,400
So there is a balance to strike

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,000
between the extent to which we can further our own nest,

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,039
so to speak,

69
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,000
and the risk of being ostracised by the group.

70
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,159
A consumer is a person who buys things or services,

71
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:50,240
for example, food or clothes.

72
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,639
Or the use of a parking space or a taxi.

73
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,319
Now, if I park my car and I don't pay for the parking space,

74
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,599
I'm being dishonest,

75
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,599
but I'm also saving money.

76
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,919
And Philip Graves says being dishonest

77
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,319
is part of our psychological makeup.

78
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,439
What does that mean?

79
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,879
Our psychological makeup is the way the human mind works,

80
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,319
the way we think.

81
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,479
And it makes sense to be dishonest

82
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,359
if you gain an advantage through this behaviour.

83
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:18,239
So when you take something without paying for it,

84
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,719
you save money, you can spend on something else.

85
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,240
So why do we place such importance on being honest then

86
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,400
if we benefit from being dishonest?

87
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,960
Because it's selfish behaviour,

88
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,840
which other members of our social group won't like.

89
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,759
If everybody acted selfishly and dishonestly all the time,

90
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,240
the world will be a very unpleasant place.

91
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,879
Selfish.

92
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,240
Meaning only caring about yourself and not about other people.

93
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,360
That's a good point, Rob.

94
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,039
Yes, societies work better if people behave cooperatively,

95
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,159
which means working together towards shared goals.

96
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,799
So honesty really is the best policy then,

97
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,319
at least most of the time.

98
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,120
And now it's time for the answer to the quiz.

99
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,319
Who said honesty is the best policy?

100
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,359
What do you think, Rob?

101
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:03,359
Okay, well, was it Benjamin Franklin?

102
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,759
And that was the right answer.

103
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,560
Hey.

104
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,479
Maybe the question was too easy.

105
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,199
Benjamin Franklin wrote it in a book of Proverbs

106
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,199
called Poor Richards Almanac

107
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,319
between 1732 and 1758.

108
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,240
Other famous quotes include,

109
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,960
There are no gains without pains.

110
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,199
And have you something to do tomorrow?

111
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:23,920
Do it today.

112
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,680
Okay, well, let's follow Franklin's wise words

113
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,800
and move right ahead with the vocabulary items we learned today.

114
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,000
First up was the adjective Honest,

115
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,040
meaning truthful and not trying to cheat people.

116
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,759
For example, Neil has a very honest face.

117
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,199
Okay, then there's honesty and honestly,

118
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,439
the noun and adverb forms.

119
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,639
For example,

120
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,240
um, honestly, Rob,

121
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,079
hurry up and do the second item.

122
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,279
Okay, okay, I'm getting there.

123
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,079
To cheat means to behave dishonestly to get what you want.

124
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,560
My granny always used to cheat in card games.

125
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,839
It was so annoying.

126
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,800
And I always used to cheat in spelling tests at school.

127
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,480
How dishonest, Rob.

128
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,720
Okay, number three, consumer.

129
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,159
A person who buys goods or services for their own personal use.

130
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:15,759
For example, I am a big consumer of chocolate bars.

131
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,439
That's horrible English, Rob.

132
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:22,240
How about we ask UK consumers how much money they spend on food every month?

133
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,480
Okay, I agree. That's a better example.

134
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,639
Anyway, I never consume chocolate.

135
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,759
Right, number four.

136
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,879
Psychological makeup, the way our minds work.

137
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:32,560
The way we think.

138
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,319
For example, he had the psychological makeup of a serial killer.

139
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,839
Ur, that's nasty.

140
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,319
Moving on, selfish, caring only about yourself and not other people.

141
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,079
You only made yourself a cup of tea.

142
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,599
That was a selfish thing to do.

143
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,480
What?

144
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,680
It was just an example.

145
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,960
You're not selfish, Neil.

146
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,840
You're actually the most cooperative person I know.

147
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,640
You're happy to work with others towards a common goal.

148
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,160
Ah, not selfish, then.

149
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,240
Never selfish, always cooperative.

150
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,760
And honest too.

151
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,560
Great.

152
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,760
Now, I honestly recommend that listeners visit our Facebook,

153
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,240
Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages.

154
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,439
You can cooperate with other learners in your common goal

155
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,120
of improving your English.

156
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,600
Bye-bye.

157
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,080
Goodbye.
