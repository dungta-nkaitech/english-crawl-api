00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,560
From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,080
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,359
And hello, I'm Rob.

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,879
So, Rob, you are a man who enjoys travel.

8
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:23,199
What's the furthest journey you've ever made?

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,719
Well, I have been to the other side of the world.

10
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:28,800
I've been to Australia, New Zealand.

11
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:30,719
So, from London, that's a very long way.

12
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:31,600
And how was it?

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,359
It was pretty boring, really, and quite cramped on the aeroplane,

14
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:37,120
but I loved it when I got there.

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,920
So, how would you feel about a journey of 56 million kilometres

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,240
that took around nine months?

17
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,040
Oh, right.

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,799
I'd have to travel business class, I think.

19
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,359
Lots of movies and a very comfortable seat.

20
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,719
Well, that's how long it would take to get to the planet Mars.

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,960
And this programme is all about the women

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,079
who want to be the first to set foot on the red planet.

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,320
First, though, today's question, which is about the size of Mars.

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,120
Is it A bigger than Earth?

25
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,120
B about the same size as Earth or C smaller than Earth?

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,359
Hmm, I'm pretty sure I know this.

27
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,319
It's bigger than Earth, much bigger, I think.

28
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,000
Okay, well, we'll find out if you're right at the end of the programme.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,560
It's been 40 years since NASA first recruited women to be astronauts.

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,159
Today, a third of the people who work at NASA are women.

31
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,759
Yes, and 2016 was the first year that there were an equal number of women

32
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,399
and men joining as astronaut trainees.

33
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:39,840
Equality is slowly coming, but only men have had the opportunity to walk on the moon,

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,879
although that was over 45 years ago.

35
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,479
Karen Nyberg is one of NASA's current astronauts.

36
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,920
In a recent BBC News feature, she talked about her hopes.

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,799
When did she join the astronaut programme?

38
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,359
When I was selected as an astronaut in the year 2000,

39
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,840
I thought that that might be a realistic possibility

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,120
that we would be the ones the next to go to the moon.

41
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,599
So it's unfortunate we weren't.

42
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,000
When did she become an astronaut?

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,520
Well, she said that she was selected in 2000.

44
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
Selected means chosen.

45
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,439
At that time, when she was selected,

46
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,719
she thought going to the moon would be a realistic possibility.

47
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,960
So she thought that it wasn't just a dream,

48
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,479
but something that could happen.

49
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,400
There was a good chance it would happen.

50
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,000
However, she was disappointed because that opportunity

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,599
didn't arrive at that time.

52
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:30,640
She describes that as being unfortunate.

53
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,599
In this sense, unfortunate means unlucky.

54
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,439
If you use this adjective, it means you are disappointed about something.

55
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,879
But you do perhaps understand the reason for it.

56
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,319
So far, a woman hasn't had the opportunity to step on the moon.

57
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,080
These days, Mars is the big target for space travel.

58
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,200
There are many problems to overcome, but could it

59
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,119
be a woman who is the first person to take that step?

60
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:56,719
Absolutely. Why not?

61
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:01,199
On a mission to Mars, there will be need for many different kinds of specialists.

62
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,319
We tend to think of astronauts as spaceship pilots,

63
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,599
but really, I think they're much more like scientists

64
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,359
carrying out different experiments.

65
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:11,519
If we're going to set up a base on Mars,

66
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,399
one thing that would be very important is to try to find a way of growing food.

67
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:19,599
For that, you need people with skills in those areas.

68
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,799
One person with those skills is Joya Masa,

69
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:25,359
a life science project manager for NASA.

70
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:27,680
Now, you would think that being a top scientist,

71
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,120
she would be brilliant at all areas or aspects of the job,

72
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,319
but she told BBC News that it wasn't always the case.

73
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,919
What two aspects does she mention she wasn't good at?

74
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,359
There certainly were aspects where I was challenged.

75
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:45,759
You know, I wasn't as great in math as some of my colleagues.

76
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,599
My handwriting is terrible.

77
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,439
So there are things that are not my strengths,

78
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,719
but when I fell in love with plants and plants were my strength,

79
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,879
and I really learned and focused on that.

80
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,439
So Rob, what did she have problems with?

81
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,240
Well, she said that she wasn't good at math.

82
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,280
Math is a North American English word for what in British English we call maths.

83
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
Both words mean mathematics.

84
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,799
So math in American English, maths in British English.

85
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,359
She also said that her handwriting's terrible.

86
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,160
Mind you, if her handwriting was really terrible,

87
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,280
maybe nobody would be able to read her bad maths.

88
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,160
Good point.

89
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,520
So handwriting and maths aren't or weren't her strengths.

90
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,840
They are not what she's good at.

91
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,439
What are her strengths?

92
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,960
Well, the thing she is good at,

93
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,160
her real strengths are working with plants,

94
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,240
so that's what she concentrated on.

95
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,800
Right. Well, let's see if one of your strengths

96
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,560
is the knowledge of the planets.

97
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,960
Today's quiz question was,

98
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,319
Is Mars a bigger than Earth be about the same size as Earth

99
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,159
or see smaller than Earth?

100
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,439
What did you say, Rob?

101
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,239
I said that it was bigger, much bigger.

102
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:56,719
And the answer, I'm afraid to say,

103
00:04:56,719 --> 00:05:00,959
is that Mars is smaller than Earth, much smaller, in fact.

104
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,560
Oh, well, I guess I won't be selected to be an astronaut anytime soon.

105
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,479
Before we blast off out of here,

106
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,039
let's review the vocabulary we covered today.

107
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,279
The first word was the one you just mentioned,

108
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,879
selected, meaning chosen.

109
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,319
Then we had the phrase a realistic possibility

110
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,439
to describe something that has a good chance of happening,

111
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,679
unlike my astronaut application.

112
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:23,359
Well, if you did become an astronaut,

113
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,879
that would be unfortunate.

114
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:27,039
Our next word, for me at least.

115
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:28,799
Unfortunate.

116
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:30,639
You mean disappointing for you?

117
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,239
Well, if you were up in space,

118
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,239
I wouldn't have the pleasure of your company.

119
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:35,839
Ah, hashtag blushing.

120
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,199
Our next word was aspects, meaning parts of something.

121
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,680
And then the Americanization math.

122
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,039
Which we call maths or mathematics in British English.

123
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,399
And finally, we had strengths and maths, certainly,

124
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,680
isn't one of my strengths.

125
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,599
It's not something I'm good at.

126
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:55,039
But one of your strengths is saying nice things about people.

127
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,480
Hashtag double blush.

128
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,199
Well, time for us to go.

129
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,039
Not to Mars, but to lunch.

130
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,159
Just time to say you can also find us on Facebook,

131
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:05,759
Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.

132
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,199
And of course, on our website,

133
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,199
bbclearningenglish.com.

134
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,959
Thank you for joining us and goodbye.

135
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:12,159
Bye-bye.
