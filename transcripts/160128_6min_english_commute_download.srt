5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,280
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,480
And I'm Alice. Now, Neil, how do you get to work?

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,440
I cycle.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,879
I didn't know that.

9
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:23,519
Somehow I hadn't imagined you as a cyclist.

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,199
And where's all your bike gear?

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,400
Well, I sneak in in the morning, have a shower and get changed.

12
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,160
That's my bike in the corner over there.

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,759
Oh, you've got a fold-away bike, which means it folds up,

14
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:36,479
so it's easy to carry or put away.

15
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:37,759
Do you wear Lycra, Neil?

16
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:39,439
Yes, I do. It's very comfortable.

17
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,439
Oh. I wear Lycra as often as I can.

18
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,359
Lycra, by the way, is a stretchy fabric used in tight-fitting sports clothes.

19
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,039
Well, I'll have to see if I can catch you on your way into the building.

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,239
I'm intrigued about this sporty Neil I didn't know about.

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,079
Intrigued means to be very interested in something.

22
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,920
Well, Alice, I'm flattered.

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,719
And today's show is about commuting or traveling between your home and your work.

24
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:07,439
So how did you commute this morning, Alice?

25
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,879
I got the tube.

26
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,120
That's the subway system here in London,

27
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,120
also known as the Underground.

28
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,959
And it was a nightmare.

29
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,959
We stopped in a tunnel for so long that people started talking to each other.

30
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:22,959
And for those of you who aren't Londoners, that's unusual.

31
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:24,719
Do you ever talk to people on the train?

32
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,560
No. People think you're crazy if you talk to strangers.

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,879
Well, maybe now's a good time to talk about today's quiz question, Alice.

34
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,480
What question do you have for me?

35
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,680
All right, then. I know you like my questions, Neil.

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,039
So here we go.

37
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:43,359
What did the word commuter originally describe?

38
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,799
Was it someone who, a, traveled with other people,

39
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,239
b, paid a reduced fare to travel,

40
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:53,039
or c, traveled by train to work?

41
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,440
Oh, that's easy. I'm going to go for c, traveled by train to work.

42
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,960
Well, we'll find out later whether you're right or not.

43
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,520
Now, let's listen to a commuter in Nairobi

44
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,560
who takes a matato to get to work.

45
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,640
These are mini buses used as shared taxis in East Africa.

46
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,280
Can you spot a word that means being quick to notice things going on around you?

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,759
When I'm stuck in the matato,

48
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,239
there is a lot of strange things happening around you.

49
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,079
So you have to be alert in Nairobi.

50
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,959
When you open, you leave your window open,

51
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,399
somebody can run away with your belongings.

52
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:35,599
You may be speaking using the phone,

53
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,599
somebody just snatch your phone.

54
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,840
You may expect that unexpected.

55
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,919
The word used by this commuter in Kenya is alert,

56
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,079
and in these noisy crowded buses,

57
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:54,239
you need to be alert in case someone runs away with your belongings.

58
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,319
Belongings are the things that you own.

59
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,279
Right. Somebody might snatch your phone.

60
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,000
Snatch means to take something quickly.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,879
Public transport in Nairobi sounds stressful.

62
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,079
If I was taking the bus, I'd want to have a nap or short sleep.

63
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:12,560
Yes. Well, people have done research on commuting and stress levels,

64
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,359
and interestingly, women are more likely to experience stress during their journey

65
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,120
Why is that?

66
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,440
Well, they're more likely to do something,

67
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,000
which is being called trip chaining,

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,960
where they make one or more stops on the way to work,

69
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,240
or going home.

70
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,600
For example, to drop off or pick up the kids from school.

71
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,440
And this makes it more likely that something will go wrong with their journey.

72
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,360
Even if you want trip chaining, it's no fun being stuck in a traffic jam.

73
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,360
That's a large number of vehicles close together, moving slowly,

74
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,800
or being packed into a crowded train like Sardines.

75
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,280
Let's face it, traveling by car or by public transport can be really miserable.

76
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,760
Yes. Packed in like Sardines describes people standing so close together that they can't move,

77
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,040
like fish in a can.

78
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,680
So, let's hear how longer commutes can affect your health from US researcher Christine Heiner.

79
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,680
My study found that adults who commuted longer distances from home to work

80
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,800
were less physically active, less physically fit,

81
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,800
weighed more, and had higher blood pressure than those people who had shorter commutes.

82
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,759
The American researcher must be talking about commuters who aren't engaged in active travel,

83
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,120
mustn't she? Because if you cycle a longer distance,

84
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,120
then you're being more physically active.

85
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,519
Hmm, I think you're right for once, Neil.

86
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,720
Yeah.

87
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,960
And I better start going to the gym more.

88
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,280
I don't like the sound of high blood pressure.

89
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,439
Why don't you hop on your bike, Alice, then we can both wear Lycra to work.

90
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:53,119
That's a fantastic idea, Neil. Moving on, here's the answer to today's quiz question.

91
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:57,519
I asked, what did the word commuter originally describe?

92
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,199
Was it someone who, A, traveled with other people,

93
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,000
B, paid a reduced fare to travel, or C, traveled by train to work?

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,680
And I said C, traveled by train to work, it must be right.

95
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,759
And you are wrong, I'm afraid.

96
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,560
It's B, someone who paid a reduced fare to travel.

97
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,759
The Oxford Dictionary says the word commute comes from Latin commutare,

98
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,000
from comm altogether plus mutare to change.

99
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,560
The word was used in the US in the 1840s when people paid a reduced or commuted fare to

100
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,439
travel by rail from the suburbs into the city.

101
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,399
Okay, can you tell us the words we heard today again, Alice?

102
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,000
Of course I can, here they are.

103
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:56,240
Fold away bike, Lycra, intrigued, commuting, the tube, alert, belongings, snatch,

104
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:04,879
nap, traffic jam, packed in like sardines, commuted.

105
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,759
Well, that's the end of today's journey with 6 Minute English.

106
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,079
Please do join us again soon. Goodbye.

107
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,639
Bye.
