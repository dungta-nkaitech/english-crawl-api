00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,320
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,519
And hello, I'm Rob.

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,920
Today we're talking about plastic.

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,280
Yes, it's our addiction to plastic that's of concern because this material doesn't decay very quickly.

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,719
So once we've used it, it hangs around for a very long time.

10
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:33,039
It is a problem and decay, by the way, describes the natural process of something being destroyed

11
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:35,200
or breaking down into small particles.

12
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,920
We hear so much about the consequences of having too much waste plastic around, don't we?

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,320
Indeed, not only does it cause a mess,

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,840
wildlife, particularly marine animals, are at risk when they become entangled in plastic waste,

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,120
or ingest it.

16
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,679
It's an issue that needs tackling or dealing with, and that's what we'll be discussing today,

17
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,280
and finding out what could be done to solve this plastic crisis.

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,840
Okay, first let's challenge you to answer a question about plastic, Rob.

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,719
The first synthetic plastic that's plastic made entirely from man-made materials

20
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,120
was created over a hundred years ago.

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,599
Do you know what its brand name was?

22
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,640
Was it A, Baker Light, B, Lucite, or C for Miker?

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,159
I'm no expert, so I'll say C for Miker.

24
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,280
Well, we'll reveal the answer at the end of the programme.

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,519
Now let's talk more about plastic.

26
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:31,439
This man-made substance is everywhere, from clothing to crisp packets and bottles to buckets.

27
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,640
But the problem is that most of it isn't biodegradable.

28
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,040
That's a word that describes something that can decay naturally without harming anything.

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,799
Each year, 400 million tons of plastic is produced,

30
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,520
and 40% of that is single use.

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,599
So why don't we stop using it?

32
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:52,640
It's not that easy, Rob, and it's something Lucy Siegel, a BBC reporter and author,

33
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
has been talking about.

34
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,120
She was speaking in a discussion on the costing the Earth programme on BBC Radio 4

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,000
and explained the issue we have with quitting plastic,

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,239
but also how our attitude is changing.

37
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,439
We have this weird psychological attachment to this material that's been around,

38
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:10,800
and it's like a push and pull.

39
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,439
At the one time, we're so horrified by what we're seeing,

40
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,240
the whales dying, the oceans vomiting plastic,

41
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,759
beaming in from all over the world.

42
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,960
And at the same time, we're being told we can't live without it.

43
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,760
So that creates a sort of psychological dissonance,

44
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,480
which I think is the barrier to behavioural change.

45
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,560
But I'm finding now awareness is peaked, and now it's going over into activism.

46
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,080
She mentioned the word psychological.

47
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,960
That's something that affects or involves our mind.

48
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,719
So here, psychological attachment means that in our mind,

49
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,719
we feel we have to use plastic.

50
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:43,600
We're addicted.

51
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,240
But we also see the negative impact of plastic, like whales dying.

52
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,600
And in our mind, we're also thinking we must stop.

53
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,680
This is created what Lucy says is a psychological dissonance.

54
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,520
Dissonance means a disagreement between two opposing ideas.

55
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,800
So we're having an argument in our head about the right thing to do.

56
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,400
This is the push and pull of thoughts she referred to.

57
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,680
And this dissonance has been the barrier to us trying to solve the plastic issue.

58
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,160
But now we're starting to do something about it.

59
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,040
We're taking action to reduce our plastic waste.

60
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,039
We're turning to activism.

61
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,280
That's taking action to change something.

62
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,599
It could be social or political change,

63
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,919
or a change in our behaviour or attitude.

64
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,680
Of course, there's been a big push.

65
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,280
That means people have been strongly encouraged to recycle.

66
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,519
Maybe in an ideal world, the best thing to do is go plastic free.

67
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,120
But that isn't easy, is it?

68
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,919
No, it isn't.

69
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,319
And it's something Lucy Siegel spoke about.

70
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,319
Getting rid of plastic in our lives is a gradual process.

71
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,359
But where does she think we can make the biggest difference?

72
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,039
I really think that to concentrate on stopping the flow of plastics into your life

73
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:58,400
is easier and more effective in the long term than trying to go plastic free from the outset.

74
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,000
We are in the UK a supermarket culture.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,159
So a lot of the tips and tricks to decreasing the flow of plastic

76
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,400
are getting round supermarket culture.

77
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,199
She says we have a supermarket culture in the UK.

78
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,279
Culture here describes a way of life for a way that we generally behave.

79
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,120
And in terms of food shopping, we tend to do that in supermarkets.

80
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,759
So for example, customers can make a big difference

81
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,159
by putting pressure on supermarkets to use less plastic packaging.

82
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:31,279
It does seem that the future of plastic is in our hands.

83
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,399
We need to be more careful about how and when we use it

84
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,079
and use our collective power to force change if it's needed.

85
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,759
But there's no doubt plastic is useful for many things.

86
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,800
So it will be a long time before it disappears all together.

87
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,000
And earlier I asked you what was the name of the first synthetic plastic

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
invented over a hundred years ago.

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,480
Was it a bakerlight, b lucite or c for mica?

90
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,199
And I said c for mica, was I right?

91
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,399
For mica is a type of hard plastic used for covering tables and working areas and kitchens.

92
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,439
But it's not the oldest type. That was bakerlight.

93
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,319
I may have got that wrong, but hopefully I'll have more success

94
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,480
recapping some of today's vocabulary.

95
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,719
Starting with decay, which describes the natural process of something

96
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:19,920
being destroyed or breaking down into small particles,

97
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,079
which plastic takes a long time to do.

98
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,159
Next we had biodegradable.

99
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:28,959
That's a word to describe something that can decay naturally without harming anything.

100
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,560
Then we had psychological.

101
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,199
That's something that affects or involves your mind.

102
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,159
Next up we had dissonance, which describes a disagreement between two opposing ideas.

103
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,840
And then we mentioned activism.

104
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,240
That's taking action to change something.

105
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,120
We also mentioned the phrase a big push, which means people are strongly encouraged or persuaded

106
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,280
to do something, usually by force.

107
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,440
And finally we had culture.

108
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,120
In our context of supermarket culture, it describes a way of life or a way that we generally behave.

109
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,080
