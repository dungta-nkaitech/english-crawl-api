Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

3
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,559
And I'm Neil.

4
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,920
That's a tasty chocolate bar you're munching on, Neil.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,320
Tasty but maybe not healthy.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,640
But at least on the wrapper there's a label to tell you about its sugar, fat and calorie content.

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,039
Yes, the little coloured guide on the wrapper allows consumers to compare the

8
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:37,520
healthiness of different things.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,519
Well in this programme we'll be looking at an idea to add a label showing the carbon footprint

10
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:48,719
of a product and talking about some vocabulary used around this subject.

11
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,760
By carbon footprint we mean how much carbon is used through the activities of a person,

12
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:55,280
company or country.

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,839
This new system sounds like a good idea, Sam.

14
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:02,079
Yes, but as normal we still have a question for you to answer first.

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,879
I think we all agree we want to reduce our carbon footprint somehow.

16
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,680
But according to the Centre for Research into Energy Demand Solutions,

17
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:20,319
how many tons of CO2 equivalent per person annually could be reduced by living car free?

18
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:28,799
Is it A around one ton, B around two tons, or C around three tons?

19
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,359
I'm sure living without a car would reduce CO2 so I'll say C around three tons.

20
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,359
Okay, Neil. We'll find out if that's right at the end of the programme.

21
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,239
But let's talk more about carbon labeling.

22
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:48,319
Listing the carbon dioxide emissions of a product on the packaging may encourage us to make

23
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,839
greener choices.

24
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:53,279
It's not a new idea but it's something that's never caught on,

25
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,359
become popular or fashionable.

26
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:00,879
Until now, the idea now seems to have returned and it's something the BBC World Service

27
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,399
programme, the climate question, has been looking into.

28
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,680
They've been speaking to business leaders about adding labeling to their products.

29
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,280
Such as Mark Engel, Chief Supply Chain Officer at Unilever.

30
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,639
Let's hear why he thinks the idea is growing in popularity.

31
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:25,039
What we are seeing is the generation Z and millennials are much, much more willing to make choices,

32
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,239
informed choices about responsible products and brands.

33
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,159
So that's also why we're doing it.

34
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:35,439
At the end of the day, we're doing it because we believe that this is what consumers will

35
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,799
ask from business.

36
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:39,759
You know, this is not something that we made up ourselves.

37
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:46,799
So in this case, it seems it's people buying Unilever products who are driving this change,

38
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,080
particularly younger people from Gen Z.

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,880
So people born towards the end of the 20th century or the beginning of the 21st century,

40
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,880
or slightly older millennials.

41
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,800
They want to make informed choices about what they buy,

42
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,560
so making decisions based on good and accurate information.

43
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,880
Carbon labeling is part of that information.

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,439
And Mark Engel mentioned consumers wanting to buy responsible products or brands.

45
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:21,439
Hear that means trusted or reliable with less environmental impact.

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,479
That all makes sense, and it's why Unilever recently announced it's committed to putting

47
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,840
carbon footprint information on 70,000 products.

48
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,240
The Climate Question Program also spoke to Dr. Zayna Gadema Cook,

49
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,159
an expert in supply chain management at Northumbria University.

50
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,280
What does she call measuring a product's carbon footprint?

51
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:50,159
The problem with footprinting is it's almost impossible to include the consumption stage associated

52
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,000
with the consumer because we all deal with the products that we purchase and dispose of differently.

53
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,520
So it's very difficult to include that.

54
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:08,479
So farm to fork calculations tend to really be farm to retail shelf calculations of carbon footprint

55
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:16,719
loadings. So Dr. Zayna Gadema Cook describes the measurement of a product's carbon footprint as

56
00:04:16,719 --> 00:04:23,360
foot printing, and this she says is difficult to measure because we don't know what people do with

57
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,480
the stuff after they have bought it. Yes, so for example a carbon label might show an estimate of

58
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,879
the carbon footprint of milk from a cow to the consumer. What Dr. Zayna Gadema Cook calls farm to

59
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,000
fork, but after it leaves the supermarket shelf we don't know how efficiently it's stored,

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,719
how much is wasted, and what happens to the packaging.

61
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,839
It's all food for thought, something to think seriously about.

62
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,839
And Sam, what do you think about my answer to your question earlier?

63
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,519
Ah yes, I asked you, according to the Centre for Research,

64
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:07,839
into energy demand solutions, how many tons of CO2 equivalent per person annually could be reduced

65
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:14,879
by living car free? And I said around three tons, which was actually a bit too much.

66
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:24,240
Research found living car free reduces the persons annual CO2 production by an average of 2.04 tons.

67
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,240
Anyway, let's briefly recap some of the vocabulary we've mentioned today.

68
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,560
Yes, we've been talking about measuring our carbon footprint. That's how much carbon is used

69
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,560
through the activities of a person, company or country. And footprinting is an informal way of

70
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,480
saying measuring the carbon footprint of something. When something has caught on, it means it has

71
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:53,199
become popular or fashionable. And making informed choices means making decisions based on good

72
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,680
and accurate information. Buying something that is responsible means that it is trusted or reliable.

73
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,959
And the phrase from farm to fork describes the processes involved from agricultural production

74
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:10,639
to consumption. We're out of time now, but thanks for listening. Bye for now. Goodbye.
