From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,480
Hello, welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Rob.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,960
And hello, I'm Neil.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,080
Now, Neil, how do you feel about surf and turf?

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,519
Surf and turf? I love it.

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,760
What's not to love? Some lobster, a juicy steak, fries on the side.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,960
Mmm, delicious.

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,920
Ah, you know what you've done there?

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,079
No, do tell.

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,039
You've got completely the wrong end of the stick.

14
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,799
I said steak, not steak. A juicy steak.

15
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,960
No wrong end of the stick.

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,320
You misunderstood me.

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,280
I'm not talking about the surf and turf meal,

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,880
but the online shopping habit of surfing and surfing.

19
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,640
Ah, my bad.

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,560
But to be fair, this is quite a new use of this expression, isn't it?

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,439
Yes, it is.

22
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,719
Now, you probably know that surfing is a verb we use

23
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,960
for looking at things on the internet.

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,239
Surf and turf refers to when we go to an online store,

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,599
select lots of things for our virtual shopping basket.

26
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:09,439
But when we get to the checkout,

27
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,799
which is the place where we pay for our shopping,

28
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:14,519
we don't actually complete the purchase.

29
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:17,560
We turf out the basket, we abandon it.

30
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,840
To turf something out is a frazel verb for throwing something out.

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,840
Although it's normally used about people, for example,

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,760
someone who is behaving badly might be turfed out of a club.

33
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,480
Indeed.

34
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,840
Well, I'm sure I'll get turfed out of the presenters union

35
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,719
if I don't get to today's quiz question.

36
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,560
According to recent research,

37
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,640
which items are the most likely to be surfed and turfed?

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,200
Is it A books, B watches, or C women's knitwear?

39
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,159
What do you think, Neil?

40
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,800
Uh, right, I think.

41
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,280
I'm almost certain it's A books.

42
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,040
Well, we'll find out if you're right later in the program.

43
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,359
Now, this research also revealed that approximately 40% of people

44
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,359
have abandoned an online shopping basket in the last year.

45
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:07,879
And it was calculated that this meant there was approximately

46
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:10,920
£18 billion worth of lost sales.

47
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,800
I have to say, I'm a bit skeptical about that figure.

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't trust it.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,920
We don't always intend to buy everything we put in our baskets.

50
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,599
It's a bit like window shopping,

51
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,159
and we just browse and find it convenient to put things

52
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,479
in our basket to think about later.

53
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,439
Have you ever done that?

54
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:29,240
Sure. It's a bit like browsing in a shop, isn't it?

55
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,000
Except you can save items you are interested in to look at later.

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,959
You might also make a basket in one online store,

57
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:38,840
then go to another to see if you can get the same

58
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,400
or similar items cheaper there.

59
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,079
So I agree, I don't think that the figure of £18 billion

60
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,840
represents a total.

61
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,560
Some of that was never intended to be spent,

62
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,960
and some would have gone to other stores.

63
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,400
But there are other reasons we don't complete our purchases.

64
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,560
For some, it's finding out at the end

65
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,960
that there'll be a high delivery cost

66
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,120
or that paying is very complicated.

67
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,680
Yes, I agree with that. That's so annoying.

68
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,240
You spend time collecting all the things in the basket,

69
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,400
then find you have to create an account

70
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,640
or can't use your favourite payment method,

71
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:14,439
or you have to pay more to use a credit card

72
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:16,759
and you have to fill out so many details.

73
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:19,159
Sometimes you get so frustrated that you just give up.

74
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,280
Exactly.

75
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,560
And this is a subject that retail expert Claire Bailey

76
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,599
discussed in the BBC programme You and Yours.

77
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:29,400
She talks about retailers, which are the businesses

78
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,759
that sell things.

79
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:34,359
What does she say 70% of retailers hadn't done?

80
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:37,800
We found that something over 70% of the retailers

81
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,039
hadn't invested in the payment process in the last two years,

82
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:44,359
so the technology is really out of date,

83
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:46,519
whereas they have potentially invested

84
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,880
in getting us to that page and then they fell foul.

85
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,800
70% of retailers hadn't invested in the payment process.

86
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,879
They hadn't changed the way people pay online for at least two years.

87
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:00,760
Because online technology develops so quickly,

88
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,480
that means that their systems are out of date.

89
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,719
Something that is out of date is too old.

90
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,960
It's no longer suitable.

91
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,840
She says that companies invest in the shopping experience

92
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,360
of their sites, but have ignored the checkout process.

93
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,199
This is where they fall foul.

94
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,680
This is where they make a mistake and get into trouble

95
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,680
and where they can lose customers.

96
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,319
Right, before we fall foul of the listeners,

97
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:25,319
let's have the answer to the quiz.

98
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:28,920
I asked you which items were the most commonly abandoned

99
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,680
at the virtual checkout?

100
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,639
Was it books, watches or women's knitwear?

101
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,839
So Neil, what did you say?

102
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,000
I am pretty certain it's books.

103
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,519
Ah, the answer was actually women's knitwear,

104
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,120
not books as you thought.

105
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,039
Ah, well, I can't be right all the time.

106
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,640
Now, some of the time would be nice.

107
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,600
Anyway, let's have a look at today's vocabulary.

108
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,360
First, surf and turf is an expression for online shopping

109
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,960
without the actual shopping.

110
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,480
You put items in your basket, but never actually buy them.

111
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,920
It's also a delicious meal of seafood and red meat.

112
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,439
Not if you're a vegetarian.

113
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,280
Ah, good point, good point.

114
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,920
The verb to turf out means to remove someone

115
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,160
from a place or organization,

116
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,680
possibly because they've broken the rules or behaved badly.

117
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:15,240
For example, if we don't finish the program on time,

118
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,879
we might be turfed out of this studio.

119
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,879
The place where you pay for your shopping,

120
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:23,480
either in a real shop or online, is the checkout.

121
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,240
That can be a verb as well as a noun.

122
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,400
You checkout at the checkout.

123
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,680
The businesses that sell you things are retailers,

124
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,120
and with hope they don't sell you things that are out of date

125
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,519
because that would mean they're past their best.

126
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,439
Too old to be suitable.

127
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:41,720
And finally, there was to full foul of something

128
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,120
or someone, which is to make a mistake

129
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,960
and get into trouble with someone.

130
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,680
And as we don't want to full foul of the next team

131
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,200
who need to use this studio,

132
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,120
it's just time for us to say goodbye

133
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,200
and to remind you to join it again

134
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,280

00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,280

That's all for now. Bye-bye.

141
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,680
Goodbye.
