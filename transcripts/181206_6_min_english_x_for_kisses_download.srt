00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,160
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,359
And I'm Rob

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,039
We're going to be looking at a letter from the English alphabet.

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,359
It's a letter which has a particular meaning

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,839
when used at the end of a piece of informal writing,

10
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,640
such as letters, emails, texts and messages.

11
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:30,800
Oh, I'm very excited.

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,719
Yeah, very good, very good, Rob.

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,120
My expectations are really high.

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,480
Yep, that's another good one.

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,120
Is it an extraordinary letter?

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,880
Okay, thank you, Rob.

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,920
That's enough of your jokes.

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,079
I'm getting exasperated.

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,120
Now you've got me at it.

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,960
Well, no prizes for guessing what letter we're focusing on today.

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,840
Why?

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,960
No, it's not why.

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,280
No, no, I didn't mean the letter why.

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,200
I meant the word why,

25
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,760
as in, why are there no prizes?

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,120
Because of all the not so subtle clues you've been giving,

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,159
the letter is excess, exactly.

28
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,879
All right, I think we get the idea.

29
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,520
Before we go much further, let's have a question.

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,240
English has 26 letters.

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,560
Which language has 74 letters?

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,159
Is it A, Camille?

33
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,159
B, Hindi or C, Armenian?

34
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,240
Any ideas, Rob?

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,879
An excellent question, but quite obscure.

36
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:27,040
I'm going to say B, Hindi.

37
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,440
Well, I'll have the answer later on.

38
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,320
Now, Rob, what does the letter X all by itself

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,840
at the end of a message mean?

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,840
Well, it means a kiss.

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,719
The more kisses, the more affection you are showing.

42
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,960
Where does this concept of putting an X to mean a kiss come from?

43
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,800
Dr. Laura Wright is from the Faculty of English at Cambridge University

44
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,560
and she appeared on the BBC Radio 4 program, Word of Mouth.

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,760
When does she say this practice started and where does it come from?

46
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,080
Well, we've been adding X's for kisses at the bottom of our letter

47
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,560
since at least 1763.

48
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,200
So the very first one we know of had seven X's.

49
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,920
I have to say I haven't gone to seven ever.

50
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,040
Probably.

51
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,719
We get X from the Roman alphabet, which got it from the Greek alphabet,

52
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,319
pronounced X.

53
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,560
And the Romans certainly found it good for cars.

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,759
It's nearly a kiss, isn't it?

55
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,280
Yeah, it is, isn't it?

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,840
I think a penny's just dropped there.

57
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,879
It has, clunk.

58
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,599
What did we learn about the origins of the X for kisses?

59
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,759
Well, it's been used since at least 1763

60
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,599
and it comes from the Roman alphabet and they got it from the Greeks.

61
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,079
And why did this come to mean a kiss?

62
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:39,840
Well, Dr. Wright suggests it's because of the original pronunciation.

63
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,240
And at that point, the presenter made the connection, didn't he?

64
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,120
Yes, he did.

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,439
And Dr. Wright used a phrase for when someone suddenly understands something,

66
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,919
particularly something that is obvious to others.

67
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,479
She said the penny has just dropped.

68
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,039
And this has got nothing to do with a penny,

69
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,079
which is a small coin actually dropping anywhere.

70
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:05,120
But the presenter makes a joke by using a word we use for the noise of something falling.

71
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,599
Clunk.

72
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,840
Although, to be honest, a penny would never really clunk.

73
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,599
That's more like the noise to heavy metal objects would make.

74
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,840
The clunk of a car door, for example.

75
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,759
Let's listen to that exchange again.

76
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:22,000
Well, we've been adding X's for kisses at the bottom of our letter

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,479
since at least 1763.

78
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,199
So the very first one we know of had seven X's.

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,759
I have to say I haven't gone to seven ever.

80
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,239
We get X from the Roman alphabet, which got it from the Greek alphabet, pronounced X.

81
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,479
And the Romans certainly found it good for cars.

82
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,680
That's nearly a kiss, isn't it?

83
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,199
Yeah, it is, isn't it?

84
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,759
I think the penny has just dropped there.

85
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,799
It has. Clunk.

86
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,320
One thing to note about putting an X at the end of a communication is that it is not something

87
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,680
you do for everyone.

88
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,480
It's usually only to friends and family members, people you might kiss in real life.

89
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,360
Professor Nils Langer from the University of Bristol told a story about a colleague of his

90
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,360
who wasn't too familiar with this convention. What was her mistake?

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I've got a colleague of mine at Bristol who, when she came over from Germany,

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,680
thought that X is just the normal way of closing a letter in England.

93
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,879
And so she wouldn't finish any letter with the X's, even letter to the England revenue.

94
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:23,759
We never heard really how the England revenue responded to this letter with these X's.

95
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,240
But...

96
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,560
Hmm, they doctor another 20 quid, I think.

97
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,400
What was her mistake, Rob?

98
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,399
She didn't realise that you don't put an X on every communication.

99
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,720
She even put it on a business letter, including one to the inland revenue,

100
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,240
which is the government department in the UK, that deals with tax.

101
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,920
We don't know how the tax people felt about the letter with kisses,

102
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,960
but the presenter joked about what their response would have been.

103
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,519
Yes, he joked that they probably doctor another 20 quid.

104
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,519
To dock money is to cut the amount of money you're expecting to receive.

105
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,879
An a quid is a slang word for a British pound.

106
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,879
Now time for the answer to our question.

107
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,600
English has 26 letters, but which language has 74 letters?

108
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,280
Is it a, Cmere, B, Hindi or C, Armenian?

109
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,519
I guessed B, Hindi.

110
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,919
Well, I suppose it was a one-in-three chance, but not correct this time.

111
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,839
The answer is A, Cmere.

112
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,679
Very well done if you knew that.

113
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:24,559
Now on to the vocabulary we looked at in this programme.

114
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:27,039
Hmm, we started with a penny.

115
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,959
A penny is an English coin.

116
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,199
A hundred pennies makes one pound sterling.

117
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,159
The phrase the penny has dropped means that someone has suddenly understood something.

118
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,159
A clunk is the noise of two heavy objects hitting each other.

119
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,439
The inland revenue is the UK's tax authority.

120
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,000
And if you dock money from someone, you reduce the amount of money you pay them.

121
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,920
For example, as an employee in the UK, your tax is automatically docked from your salary.

122
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,640
And finally a quid, which is a slang term for one pound sterling.

123
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,120
Right, before they start docking our pay for being late, it's time to say goodbye.

127

Bye bye.
