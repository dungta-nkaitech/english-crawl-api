00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,640
Hello, I'm Neil. Welcome to 6 Minute English, where we like to share.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,960
Jokes, funny stories and cavities.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,280
Er, no, Rob. We like to share six useful items of vocabulary.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,640
Ah, yes, that too.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,760
But first, check out this meme on my phone, Neil.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,879
Grumpy cat.

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,359
It's so cute. Shall I send it to you?

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,719
No, please don't.

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,719
A meme is a picture or video with an amusing caption

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,679
that a lot of people share with each other online.

15
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:41,920
Well, in this programme, we're talking about

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,239
why some online content goes viral.

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,120
And some doesn't.

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,640
This cat is cute because it looks so grumpy,

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,480
and that means bad tempered.

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,920
An image, video or other piece of information goes viral

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,759
when it gets passed on very quickly from person to person on the internet.

22
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,879
So first, let's start with our quiz question, Neil.

23
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,599
Can you tell me which was one of the first videos to go viral on the internet?

24
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,480
Was it a Charlie bit my finger?

25
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,319
B, sneezing panda?

26
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,480
Or C, dancing baby?

27
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,359
I'm going to guess sneezing panda,

28
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,359
because I haven't seen any of those videos.

29
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:18,879
That's a ridiculous, Neil.

30
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,479
Hope you've been living under a rock.

31
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,159
Look, I just don't find silly videos, particularly cute.

32
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:24,879
Or funny.

33
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:27,439
Okay, okay. No need to get grumpy about it.

34
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:28,719
Let's move on.

35
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,359
Why do so many people, Neil, excluded,

36
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,679
enjoy sharing content online?

37
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:35,759
Let's listen to Dr. Jonah Berger,

38
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,719
marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania,

39
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,840
and author of Contagias, Why Things Catch On,

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,239
talking about what motivates us to share.

41
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,719
Humans are social animals.

42
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,039
Sharing allows us to feel connected to others.

43
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:54,400
We share emotions, which allow us to deepen the bonds we have

44
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,640
with our peers and with our friends.

45
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,840
So it's all about being connected and deepening the bonds

46
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,319
between ourselves and our peers.

47
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,439
Our peers are people the same age as ourselves,

48
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,079
who share the same social position in a group.

49
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:12,719
And we particularly like to share content

50
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,800
that makes us feel emotional.

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,520
Let's hear more from Dr. Jonah Berger about this.

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,199
Higher-rowsal emotions include things like anger and anxiety,

53
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,639
but also excitement and humor,

54
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,639
lower-rowsal sadness and contentment,

55
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,400
turns out those higher-rowsal emotions,

56
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,680
those emotions that fire us up and causes to take action,

57
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,879
also drive us to share.

58
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,400
Arousal means to excite a particular feeling in somebody,

59
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,840
and emotions like anger and anxiety tend to cause

60
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,480
stronger feelings than sadness and contentment.

61
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,800
Right, high-rowsal emotions fire us up,

62
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,680
and to fire someone up means to make someone excited

63
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,759
and enthusiastic about something.

64
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,080
So when a video we see on the internet

65
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,520
makes us laugh or makes us excited or angry,

66
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,520
then we're more likely to share it with others.

67
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,000
And sharing that emotion with others

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,880
strengthens the connection or bond between us.

69
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,000
That's what Dr. Berger's theory says anyway.

70
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,240
I'm surprised that sad things aren't passed on as much as say funny things.

71
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,360
Well, how often do you share sad videos with your peers?

72
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,640
Ah, good point.

73
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,439
I do tend to share content that makes me laugh

74
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,000
more than sad or angry stuff anyway.

75
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,639
Like the grumpy cat meme, can I show it to you now?

76
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:24,960
No.

77
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,599
Okay, I'll just show you the caption.

78
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,800
It says, I've heard once, it was terrible.

79
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,879
Yeah, right, hilarious, Rob.

80
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,599
Now, can we have the answer to today's quiz question please,

81
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,280
if you've finished amusing yourself?

82
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,319
Okay, okay.

83
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,159
Which was one of the first videos to go viral on the internet?

84
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,800
Was it a Charlie bit my finger?

85
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,920
Be sneezing panda or see dancing baby?

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,919
And I said sneezing panda.

87
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,199
Oh, well, it was actually dancing baby.

88
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,519
This three-dimensional animation of a baby dancing the cha-cha

89
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,439
was one of the first viral videos released in the late 1990s.

90
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,359
Another popular one was the hamster dance by Hampton the Hamster,

91
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:09,199
which appeared in 1997.

92
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:11,279
Well, fascinating as all that sounds.

93
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:13,919
Shall we look back at the words we learned today, Rob?

94
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:14,719
Sure.

95
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:19,599
The first item was meme, a picture or video with an amusing caption

96
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,080
that a lot of people share with each other online.

97
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,480
For example, I tried to show Neil a hilarious meme about a grumpy cat.

98
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,080
The word meme was actually invented by evolutionary biologist,

99
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,840
Professor Richard Dawkins,

100
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,520
to represent an idea or concept that spreads in human culture

101
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,439
in a similar way to a gene.

102
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,560
Hmm, fascinating.

103
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,360
That sounds way too complicated, Neil.

104
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,800
Let's move on to item number two, grumpy.

105
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,000
I gave one example just now, but here's another one.

106
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,480
He's the grumpiest man I've ever met.

107
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,959
Oh, I hope you're not talking about me, Rob.

108
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,879
Number three, to go viral.

109
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:57,600
Means an image, video or other piece of information

110
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,439
that gets passed on very quickly from person to person on the internet.

111
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,079
For example, what makes a video go viral?

112
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,680
Hmm, I don't know, Neil.

113
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,680
If I knew how to make a viral video, I'd be a rich man by now.

114
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,839
Before computers and the internet, we only talked about viral infections,

115
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:14,480
didn't we?

116
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,399
I've got a nasty viral infection,

117
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,079
so I'm not coming into work today.

118
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,120
Yeah, that's right.

119
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,839
The connection is that both viral infections

120
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,399
and viral memes spread quickly.

121
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,560
Okay, number four, peers are people the same age as ourselves

122
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,519
who share the same social position in a group.

123
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,959
For example, teenagers often worry about looking silly

124
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,159
in front of their peers.

125
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,479
Next up, a rousal.

126
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,439
That means to excite a particular feeling in somebody.

127
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,399
We heard about high and lower rousal emotions.

128
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,079
The verb is to arouse.

129
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,399
For example, the debate aroused strong feelings on both sides.

130
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,879
Okay, finally, to fire someone up means to make someone excited

131
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,799
and enthusiastic about something.

132
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:59,359
I'm really fired up about today's vocabulary.

133
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,919
Good to know, Rob, but it's time to go now.

134
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,839
But please check out our Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages.

135
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,319
Bye-bye.

136
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,199
Goodbye.

137
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,079
Shall we watch that dancing baby now, Neil?

138
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,479
No.
