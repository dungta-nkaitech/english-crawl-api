6-Mute English from the BBC

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,439
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:11,599
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,519
Every four years, the best players in the world gather for one month in the summer

5
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:20,640
to take part in the biggest event in football, the World Cup.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,480
But this year, for the first time ever, the competition is taking place in winter.

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,320
Why?

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,000
Because the 2022 World Cup is happening in Qatar.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,399
Over a million fans from all over the world are expected to visit Qatar for the World Cup,

10
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,600
which starts on 20 November.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,759
Because temperatures in Qatar exceed 45 degrees in the summer,

12
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:44,000
the competition was moved to the winter.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,519
But the decision to hold the World Cup in the tiny oil-rich Gulf State has been controversial.

14
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:51,439
One of the richest countries in the world,

15
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,759
Qatar has no tradition of playing football,

16
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,719
and some have criticized the focus on money instead of sport.

17
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,359
And there are other criticisms too, about human rights and the treatment of the migrant construction workers

18
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,719
who built the football stadiums, roads, transport systems and hotels,

19
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:10,120
without which the World Cup could not happen.

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,079
In this programme, we'll be asking,

21
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,479
is it right for Qatar to host the World Cup?

22
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,680
And of course, we'll be learning some new and useful vocabulary as well.

23
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,039
But before that, I have a question for you, Beth.

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,320
Which country has won the World Cup the most times?

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,240
Is it A Italy, B Brazil or C Germany?

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,960
I think it must be Brazil.

27
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,920
OK, I'll reveal the answer at the end of the programme.

28
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,880
Advertising for the Qatar World Cup shows football fans staying in new hotels

29
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,760
and watching matches in air-conditioned stadiums.

30
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:47,320
But hidden behind this, the lives of the migrant workers from Nepal, India and other South Asian countries

31
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,520
reveal a very different story.

32
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:55,519
The population of Qatar is tiny and 95% of the total workforce are foreigners

33
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:01,000
working in extreme heat, housed in poor quality accommodation and often underpaid.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,679
Rottene Begum, a researcher for human rights watch, explained their situation

35
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:08,840
to BBC World Service programme Business Daily.

36
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,840
We're still recording and documenting migrant workers' facing abuse and exploitation in Qatar.

37
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,080
They include workers reporting having paid, exorbitant and illegal recruitment fees

38
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,719
to secure work brought on two-year contracts and then finding out they're coming on three-month visas,

39
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:31,039
which means that they're not able to make up or recruit the price that they've paid to actually get this job

40
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,000
and may well be sent home in debt on top of everything else.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,560
Migrant workers face exploitation.

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,240
Exploitation means treating someone unfairly to get some advantage for yourself.

43
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,960
Many of the World Cup workers were exploited by being paid less than agreed,

44
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,760
being paid late or not being paid at all.

45
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:57,439
The construction jobs seemed a good opportunity for migrant workers to save money to send home to their families.

46
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:04,080
Many paid exorbitant fees, fees which were much bigger than they should be, just to get a job in Qatar.

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,040
But despite being given two-year job contracts, some workers were only allowed to stay three months

48
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:13,479
because they couldn't make enough money, many returned home in debt,

49
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:17,239
owing money to someone that they will have to pay back.

50
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,239
What's worse, many have died building the football stadiums in accidents

51
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,799
or due to overwork and heat stress.

52
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:30,359
So with all this criticism, added to the billions of dollars Qatar spent preparing for the competition,

53
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:31,799
was it worth it?

54
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,000
James Dorsey is an expert on the politics of football in the Middle East.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,080
Here, he explains to BBC World Services Business Daily that for Qatar,

56
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,560
hosting the World Cup is more about improving its international reputation than economics.

57
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,840
But this is not about economics for Qatar.

58
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,080
Qatar is a small state.

59
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,080
It is sandwiched between two regional behemoths, Saudi Arabia and Iran.

60
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,439
And so its whole policy is geared towards soft power,

61
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,079
whether that's sports, whether that's the airport and the airline.

62
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:12,079
Qatar may be rich thanks to its oil, but it's not a large country,

63
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:14,960
unlike neighboring Saudi Arabia and Iran.

64
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,399
Countries which James Dorsey called behemoths,

65
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,360
something which is extremely large and powerful.

66
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,800
Qatar is sandwiched between these larger countries.

67
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,519
If you're sandwiched between two things, you're in a narrow tight space between them.

68
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:34,879
Because Qatar isn't as powerful as its bigger neighbours, it uses soft power.

69
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:40,079
The way a country uses its economic and cultural influence to persuade other countries

70
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,319
instead of using military power.

71
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,839
Hosting an important international event like the World Cup

72
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:52,000
is a part of Qatar's soft power strategy to be considered an important country on the world stage.

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,479
Whatever the rights and wrongs of the debate,

74
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,759
this will be the first Arab nation to host the World Cup,

75
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,120
although it's unlikely that the Qatari team will actually win.

76
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,519
Unlike a more famous footballing nation, Italy, who won their first World Cup,

77
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,920
they hosted in 1934.

78
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,759
And speaking of World Cup winners, what was the answer to your question, Neil?

79
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,399
Which country has won the most World Cups?

80
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,680
I guess it was Brazil.

81
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,399
Which was the correct answer, of course, with five title wins, Brazil,

82
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:26,000
is the most successful World Cup team, followed closely by Italy and Germany with four titles each.

83
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,480
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned starting with exploitation,

84
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,319
treating someone unfairly in order to benefit yourself.

85
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,160
If the price of something is exorbitant, it's much higher than it should be.

86
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,639
A debt is an amount of money that you owe to someone else.

87
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,560
A behemoth refers to something which is extremely large and powerful.

88
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,519
And if you are sandwiched between two things, you're in a tight narrow space between them.

89
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:57,279
And finally, soft power describes strategies used by a country to increase its power through

90
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,879
economic and cultural influences instead of fighting wars.

91
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:03,120
Once again, our six minutes are up.

92
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,919
Goodbye for now.

93
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:04,319
Bye.
