Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,800
And I'm Georgina.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,719
Do you believe in ghosts, Georgina?

6
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:24,640
Well, I've never actually seen one, not even at Halloween.

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,080
How about dragons, then, or fairies and elves?

8
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,000
Have you been reading fantasy books, Neil? Lord of the Rings?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,519
I have been reading a book, Georgina, but not Lord of the Rings.

10
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:38,159
My book is about an amphibious creature,

11
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,359
a creature that lives both on land and in water.

12
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:43,200
Some kind of frog, man?

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,399
Hmm, you've almost got the idea, Georgina, but think.

14
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,599
Woman, not man, and fish, not frog.

15
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:54,399
Half woman, half fish. Hmm, I've got it, a mermaid.

16
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,199
That's right. Mermaids are magical creatures,

17
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:03,280
half woman, half fish, that feature in the myths and legends of many cultures around the world.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,359
Like the sirens, who's seductive singing, shipwrecked, or dizziness,

19
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,480
and his sailors in ancient Greek mythology.

20
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,640
The sirens are perhaps the most famous,

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,159
but certainly not the only mermaids we'll be hearing about.

22
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,319
But before we dive into the programme, it's time for my quiz question.

23
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,519
The book I've been reading was, of course, the little mermaid.

24
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,319
Yes, I've seen the Disney movie.

25
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,479
The mermaid is called Ariel.

26
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,199
Right, but the movie was based on a fairy tale written by Hans Christian Anderson.

27
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:38,159
It became so famous that a statue of the little mermaid was built in the harbor of Anderson's

28
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:45,199
birthplace, but where? Was it A, Amsterdam, B, Copenhagen, or C, Oslo?

29
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:47,840
I'm going to say B, Copenhagen.

30
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,640
Okay, Georgina, I'll tell you the answer later.

31
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:53,840
Disney's defenseless mermaid Ariel

32
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,319
seems the total opposite to the seductive dangerous sirens in the Odyssey.

33
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,280
In fact, descriptions and stories of mermaids have always changed from place to place.

34
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,639
One mermaid-like character found across Africa and the Americas is named Mamiwata.

35
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,719
Here's British writer Marcel Mateke talking about the origins of this legend

36
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,759
to BBC World Service programme, The Forum.

37
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:25,439
Even the name Mamiwata, which is pigeon English for mother water,

38
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,319
so it's loosely translated from pigeon English as the mother of water.

39
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,439
And the characteristics that I commonly shared when speaking about Mamiwata across the West

40
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:40,879
African coast is that this deity is the protector of the water kingdom.

41
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,399
The name Mamiwata comes from Nigerian pigeon English,

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,800
a language which has developed from a mixture of two languages and is used as a way of

43
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,319
communicating by people who do not speak each other's languages.

44
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,599
Marcel says that Mamiwata means the mother of water when loosely translated.

45
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:06,000
Translated in a way that carries over the basic ideas but using words which may not be so accurate.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,879
Mamiwata is also described as the protector of the water kingdom and a deity,

47
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,920
a god, goddess or other divine being.

48
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:19,759
Another version of mermaid-like creatures called selkeys are found in the remote Orkney Islands

49
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:26,079
north of the Scottish mainland. The selkeys can take human form and marry men but every now and then

50
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,959
they return to their watery kingdom under the sea.

51
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,079
Christina Batillega is co-editor of the Penguin Book of Mermaids.

52
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:38,639
According to her, these different versions of Mermaids share something in common.

53
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,439
They force us to question our relationship to water and other beings in the natural world,

54
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,599
and even to question how we see ourselves.

55
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,159
Here's Christina explaining more in the BBC World Services, the forum.

56
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,759
The beings, not just mermaids but selkeys and water deities and other water spirits

57
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,400
are often shapeshifters. They have a certain kind of fluidity of being.

58
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:13,360
So do we approach this world with humility or do we really uphold a kind of anthropocentric

59
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,120
view, human-centered view of life?

60
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:24,000
Mythical creatures are often shape-shifters. They have the power to change into a different shape or

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,400
form. Moving between the sea and the earth, mermaid's link to natural worlds. Christina thinks

62
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,480
that as humans we should approach them with humility. Someone who has humility is not proud and

63
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,439
doesn't think they're better than others. Well, Neil, I don't think I'm better than a ghost,

64
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:47,040
a water spirit or a mermaid. It's just that I've never seen one, but then again I've never seen

65
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,560
electricity and I believe in that. Maybe it would help if you sought a statue of a mermaid if not

66
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,800
the real thing. Maybe, but where would I find one? In my quiz question, I asked you where you'd see

67
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,319
the statue of Hans Christian Anderson's Little Mermaid. What did you say, Georgina? I guessed

68
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:10,879
B. Copenhagen. Which was the correct answer? The Little Mermaid statue is found in Anderson's

69
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,759
birthplace of Copenhagen and it really is little only one and a quarter meters high.

70
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:22,159
In this programme, we've been talking about mermaids. Mythical half-woman, half-fish creatures which

71
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:29,600
are amphibious live both on land and in water. In some cultures, mermaids are deities or goddesses.

72
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,279
They can also be shape-shifters, imaginary creatures with the power to change into different shapes.

73
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:41,919
One African mermaid is called Mamiwata, in pigeon English. A mixture of English and local languages

74
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,839
which enables people who do not share a common language to communicate.

75
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:52,559
Mamiwata means mother water, but this is a loose translation. A translation which carries over

76
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:58,239
the basic idea, but using words which may not be so accurate. That's all for this programme,

77
00:05:58,239 --> 00:06:03,119
but the next time you're near the sea, keep an eye out for a splash in the waves. You never know

78
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,759
what you might see. Join us again soon for more discussion and vocabulary here at 6 Minute
