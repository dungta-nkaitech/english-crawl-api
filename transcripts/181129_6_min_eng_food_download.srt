From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,480
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,559
And I'm Rob.

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,039
And in this programme we're discussing food.

8
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,640
Ah, food, glorious food.

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,359
There's only one thing better than talking about food,

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,800
and that's eating it.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,440
Well, I know you are a bit of a gastronome.

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,240
Someone who enjoys and knows a lot about high quality food.

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,120
But today we're talking about photographing food, not eating it.

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,920
Ah, that's a shame because I am on a seafood diet.

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,200
If I see food, I have to eat it.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:43,799
Get it?

17
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:46,200
Yes, Rob, very, very funny.

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,040
But in the social media-addicted world, just seeing food, not eating it,

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,920
is big business, as I will explain shortly.

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,320
But shall we feast on a question first, Rob?

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,880
Yep, if it tastes good.

22
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,719
It does.

23
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,119
So, do you know the name for the person

24
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,519
who's usually second in charge in a restaurant kitchen

25
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,120
after the head chef

26
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,439
and has lots of responsibility for running it?

27
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:14,000
Is it the A, pastry chef, B, commie chef, or C, sous chef?

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,120
Ah, well, I'm not a chef expert, but I'll say C, a sous chef.

29
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,480
It sounds important.

30
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,159
Well, I'll give you the answer later in the programme.

31
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,439
Now, let me explain more about food and photos.

32
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,159
These days, how well a dish, that's a noun for food prepared for eating,

33
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:35,480
is photographed, can matter more than how it actually tastes.

34
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,560
And I suppose social media platforms are the best way

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,480
for sharing food photos on, aren't they?

36
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,680
And I have been guilty of taking a picture of my food on my smartphone,

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,759
but only when eating some amazing food at a posh restaurant.

38
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,840
Which isn't very often, I suppose.

39
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,280
But by sharing images across social media, people see them

40
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,120
and think the food looks delicious.

41
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,359
I must go to that restaurant and eat it.

42
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:01,560
You could argue it's all about style over substance,

43
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,000
meaning the look of something is better than the actual content or product.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,560
Maybe Rob, although I'm sure sometimes the food tastes just as good as it looks.

45
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,319
Anyway, the BBC Radio 4 programme you and yours has been looking into this.

46
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,960
They spoke to several influential Instagrammers and bloggers.

47
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,319
Influential means having the power to make people change what they think.

48
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,280
Here's one of them, Rebecca Milford,

49
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,599
who edits a website called Bar Chick.

50
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,199
What does she think about this new trend?

51
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:33,240
I mean, it sounds very cliche that a picture speaks a thousand words,

52
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,479
but it really does.

53
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:37,560
And I've got friends now that instead of doing what you used to do

54
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,199
and going onto the website of a restaurant to see what they were serving,

55
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,479
then you've gone to the Instagram account and check out the images

56
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,479
and choose what you want to eat literally based on what you're seeing.

57
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,639
So it has to be presentable, I suppose.

58
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:52,599
Rebecca used a well-known and well-used phrase there.

59
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:55,120
One that is used so much, it has become boring.

60
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,920
What we call a cliché.

61
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,280
The phrase is a picture speaks a thousand words.

62
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,920
Yes, and even if it is a cliché, it's so true.

63
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,080
You describe a fantastic meal in a long blog,

64
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,080
but you can quickly see how it looks from a picture

65
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,560
and then create an idea in your mind of how it tastes.

66
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,120
So when you're promoting food, a photo is everything.

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,840
And that's why some restaurants pay PR companies lots of money

68
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:24,520
to take stylish photos that can be shared on social media.

69
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,760
It's like a fashion photo shoot for food.

70
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,680
Yes, and Rebecca said the food has to be presentable.

71
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,240
That's looking good enough for people to see

72
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,240
because people are making choices on what they see.

73
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,760
I've also heard that some chefs and restriators

74
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,640
have adjusted their menus to produce meals

75
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,000
that look good on a smartphone camera.

76
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,480
A restriotor, by the way, is the name of a person

77
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,600
who owns and manages a restaurant.

78
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,480
Now, while there is a risk that good-looking food

79
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:55,239
on social media accounts, such as Instagram,

80
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:57,560
might not match how it tastes,

81
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,399
there is a theory your brain might trick you into thinking

82
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:02,319
it does taste good.

83
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,599
The You and Yours program also heard from Professor Charles Spence,

84
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,599
an experimental psychologist from Oxford University

85
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,079
about how this happens.

86
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,039
We see the food first or the drink in the glass,

87
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,000
and our brain's already imagining what it's going to taste like,

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,560
and the more beautifully it's presented, the more artistically.

89
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,079
That sets better expectations,

90
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,719
and they carry over an anchor the tasting experience.

91
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:27,439
Right, so a great photo of food can possibly make us think

92
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,919
it tastes better too.

93
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,519
We create an idea in our head of how it will taste,

94
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,839
which influences our expectations

95
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,839
when we actually eat the food.

96
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,240
And expectation means the feeling that something good

97
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,399
is going to happen.

98
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,719
Right, Rob. I'm sure you're expecting the answer

99
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:44,479
to the question I said to you earlier.

100
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,599
I asked if you knew the name for the person

101
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:49,560
who's usually second in charge in a restaurant kitchen

102
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,480
after the head chef and has lots of responsibility for running it.

103
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,160
Is it the A, pastry chef, B, commie chef, or C, sous chef?

104
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,480
What did you say, Rob?

105
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,639
Well, I said C, a sous chef.

106
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,720
Am I right?

107
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,680
You are, Rob.

108
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,040
Give that man a job here, maybe in the BBC canteen.

109
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,399
Come on, Neil, I think I can do better than that.

110
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:12,959
But before I do, let's remind ourselves

111
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,879
of some of the vocabulary we've discussed today.

112
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:17,319
Starting with gastronome,

113
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:21,599
that someone who enjoys and knows a lot about high quality food.

114
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:22,680
Someone like me.

115
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,079
Yeah, maybe, Rob.

116
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,399
We also discuss the word influential,

117
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,800
meaning having the power to make people change what they think.

118
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,800
We also mentioned cliché, a well-known phrase

119
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,680
that is so overused it's become boring.

120
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,959
Like, for example, a picture speaks a thousand words.

121
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:40,639
You never use clichés, do you, Neil?

122
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,000
Absolutely never.

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,879
Let's move on to presentable.

124
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,959
That describes something that looks good

125
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:48,719
is smart and is good enough for people to see.

126
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:51,680
A bit like me in my smart new jumper, do you like it?

127
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,680
You're very nice.

128
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,599
Well, a presenter has to be presentable, Neil.

129
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:57,680
Our next word was expectation,

130
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,479
a word that describes the feeling that something good is going to happen.

131
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:04,519
I have an expectation that people will love this programme.

132
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,679
Well, let's hope so.

133
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:06,439
Yes.

134
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,959
And that brings us to the end of this programme.

135
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,039
Don't forget to check out our social media platforms.

136
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:12,839
See you soon.

137
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,479
Bye-bye.

138
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:14,000
Goodbye.
