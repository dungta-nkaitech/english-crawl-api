00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,040
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil. And I'm Rob.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:19,120
From the bubonic plague to cholera and tuberculosis, disease and pandemics have changed the way cities have been built.

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,440
For example, buildings in 19th century Paris were designed with large, high-up windows to allow plenty of sunlight.

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,560
They were supposed to stop the spread of tuberculosis.

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:40,320
Coronavirus has been no different. In lockdown cities from Rio to Barcelona were transformed as wildlife and bird song

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,960
replace the noise of taxi horns and traffic. And with no car pollution, you could even see the stars at night.

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,439
In this programme we'll be asking if cities after lockdown will ever be the same again and if we want them to be.

9
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:57,679
We'll be hearing some ideas from different cities around the world.

10
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,280
And of course, we'll be learning some new vocabulary along the way.

11
00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:08,719
One of the cities most affected by Covid-19 was Mumbai and India. But approximately how many people were affected?

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,239
What's the estimated population of Mumbai? That's my quiz question for you today, Rob.

13
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:20,640
Is it A 15 million people, B 20 million people or C 25 million people?

14
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:28,640
I know Mumbai is an international mega city, so I'll say B 20 million people.

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,599
Okay, Rob, we'll find out later if that's right.

16
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:38,240
Now, Beatrice Colomina is a professor of architecture at Princeton University in the United States.

17
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,719
She spent years researching the relationship between cities and disease.

18
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:48,879
Here she is talking with Kavita Puri, presenter of BBC World Service programme The Inquiry.

19
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:59,840
Take to Buculosis, unlike cholera, which was eliminated in London by redesigning the sewage system in the 1850s, TB was airborne.

20
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:09,840
But it became really a problem with the rise of the industrial cities and the tropolis before an antibiotic was effective.

21
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:17,039
One in seven people on the planet had TB, but in dense cities like Paris, it was one in three.

22
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:26,000
Closely packed tenements met the disease spread like wildfire and architects and planning experts responded.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Some diseases like cholera could be prevented by redesigning cities to improve hygiene, like the waste water sewers in 19th century London.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But the problem with tuberculosis or TB for short was that the disease is airborne, carried and spread in the air.

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,560
Adding to the problem was the fact that antibiotics, medicines like penicillin that can destroy harmful bacteria or stop their growth,

26
00:02:52,560 --> 00:03:02,319
was not discovered until 1928, too late to save thousands of people who died in Mumbai, New York, Paris and other cities during the 1800s.

27
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,800
Diseases like TB killed more and more people, as cities industrialized and grew bigger and bigger,

28
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:15,680
leading to the creation of the metropolis, the largest, busiest and most important city in a country or region.

29
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,520
Many people crowded together in large metropolises, meaning that disease could spread like wildfire,

30
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,800
and idiom meaning spread quickly around many people.

31
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,680
Even today, disease is shaping our cities.

32
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,320
In post-COVID-Paris, new ideas for a 15-minute city,

33
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:38,480
aim to make all public services available within a 15-minute walk to help people working from home.

34
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,359
Other countries want to build better, more affordable housing outside the city centre.

35
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:50,479
But according to Mumbai resident Dr. Vadi Tandel, this won't work, even if the housing on offer is better.

36
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,599
But why? The reason is work.

37
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,359
When you shift them out, you're moving them away from their livelihoods and they're not going to be able to sustain themselves there.

38
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:07,280
So they will be coming back because their jobs are in the city and they cannot afford the commute from farther off places.

39
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,800
Dr. Vadi Tandel there, talking on the BBC World Service programme The Inquiry.

40
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,680
Trying to make cities less crowded is one way to minimise the risks from disease.

41
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,319
But moving people away from the city centre means moving them away from their livelihood,

42
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,199
their job, or other way of earning money to pay for food, housing and clothing.

43
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,879
Many people still want to live near their workplace in the city centre,

44
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,560
because they can't afford to pay for the commute, the journey between their home and their plays of work.

45
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,560
Which is a real problem when you live in a city of how many people did you say live in Mumbai, Neil?

46
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,079
Ah yes, in our quiz question I asked you what the estimated population of Mumbai is.

47
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,800
I said be 20 million people.

48
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,079
And you were absolutely right. Around 20 million people live in the Mumbai metropolis,

49
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:58,399
making it very difficult to socially distance.

50
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,360
In this programme we've been discussing the relationship between cities and disease.

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,960
In the 1800s, tuberculosis or TB killed thousands, because it was an airborne disease,

52
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,520
spread in the air and hard to prevent.

53
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,080
Antibiotics, medicinal chemicals like penicillin which can destroy harmful germs couldn't help,

54
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,120
because they weren't discovered until decades later.

55
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,920
So in metropolises, the largest and most important cities where people live,

56
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,160
crowded close together, diseases spread like wildfire,

57
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,200
an idiom meaning spread widely and quickly.

58
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,960
In Mumbai and other places, the problem remains that many people need the city for their livelihood,

59
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,200
job or other way of earning money.

60
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,680
So they prefer to live in the city centre instead of paying for the daily commute,

61
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,000
a journey often by train, bus or car, from your home to your workplace.

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,640
And that's all we have time for in this programme,

63
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:00,480
but remember you can find more useful vocabulary, trending topics and help with your language learning here

Bye bye.
