00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,200
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,320
And I'm Rob.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,280
Hey, Alice, I read in the paper recently

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,440
that the substance called fluoride might be bad for our health,

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,240
but it's in nearly every brand of toothpaste, isn't it?

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,359
You shouldn't believe everything you hear, Rob.

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,240
Fluoride protects our teeth against decay.

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,960
Hmm, but there's a theory that drug companies

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,359
are using fluoride to affect our brains and make us all dumb.

13
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,280
Oh, that's ridiculous, Rob.

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,600
Well, I'm not sure if I believe it or not, but it's worrying me.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,519
Do you also worry that the moon landing's never really happened?

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,640
It's funny you should mention that because, yes,

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,480
I wonder about this too.

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,280
Apparently, in the 1960s television footage of the moon landing,

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,520
the American flag is fluttering,

20
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,799
and there's no air on the moon so the US government must have faked it.

21
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,040
To fake something means to make something

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,599
that isn't true appear to be real.

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,280
I didn't realise you were so gullible, Rob.

24
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,799
And that means easily persuaded to believe something.

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,719
I just like to question things.

26
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:19,599
Oh, I see.

27
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:22,560
I have a healthy distrust of authority, Alice,

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,159
and today we're talking about conspiracy theories.

29
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,640
A conspiracy theory is a belief that some organisation or group of people

30
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,879
is responsible for a situation or event through secret planning.

31
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,120
We'll talk more about how healthy this type of distrust might be

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,799
later on in the show.

33
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,079
But now, please focus your intellectual powers on today's quiz question, Rob.

34
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,359
Around what proportion of the US population

35
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,039
believes that the assassination of President John F. Kennedy

36
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,080
was not the result of a lone gunman.

37
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:02,560
Is it A, 6% B, 16% or C, 60%?

38
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,120
I'll go for B, 16%.

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,680
Well, we'll find out if you chose the right answer later on in the programme.

40
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,000
But for now, let's move on.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,840
Let's talk about what types of people are thought to be susceptible to

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,200
or likely to be influenced by conspiracy theories.

43
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,360
The stereotype is of a loner.

44
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,720
Maybe male, middle-aged, sitting in front of the computer.

45
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,440
But in actual fact, this isn't true.

46
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,120
People of all ages and from all social classes are susceptible to conspiracy theories.

47
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,480
Lots of us worry that important things are being covered up.

48
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,120
And a cover-up means an attempt to prevent the public from discovering information

49
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,640
about something important.

50
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,120
Hmm, let's listen now to Professor Chris French from Goldsmiths,

51
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,680
a college within the University of London,

52
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,040
talking more about people who believe in conspiracy theories.

53
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,280
There are quite a few personality dimensions that seem to be related to

54
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,439
belief in conspiracy theories and not surprisingly, paranoia is one of them.

55
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,319
Also openness to new ideas, people who are willing to entertain,

56
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,400
ideas that are kind of off the beaten track.

57
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,439
People who believe in conspiracy theories tend to believe in the paranormal.

58
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,319
That was Professor Chris French.

59
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,360
So he says that paranoia is a personality trait or quality

60
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,560
that leads some people to believe in conspiracy theories.

61
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,720
Hmm, paranoia is a strong and unreasonable feeling

62
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,320
that other people don't like you or want to harm you.

63
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,520
And ideas that are off the beaten track,

64
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,440
are those which are unusual and aren't shared by many other people.

65
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,680
Believing in the paranormal means believing in strange things

66
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,840
that can't be explained by science.

67
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,520
For example, ghosts.

68
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,080
Ghosts, yes, do you believe in them, Alice?

69
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,080
No, Rob, I don't. How about you?

70
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,520
Oh, maybe.

71
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,640
Moving on, most of the time believing in conspiracy theories is quite harmless

72
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,280
and might even be good because we shouldn't just accept everything we're told.

73
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,320
But there can also be serious consequences.

74
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,240
Let's hear more from Professor French on this.

75
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,000
Studies have shown that people are less likely to engage with the political process.

76
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:18,560
People who accept medically-based conspiracies are likely to avoid

77
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,839
getting their kids vaccinated and even terrorist acts.

78
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:27,759
It's been shown that terrorist groups will actually use conspiracy theories

79
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,560
as both a means to get new recruits and also to motivate people to carry out

80
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,839
extreme terrorist acts.

81
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,040
So the toothpaste thing I mentioned at the beginning of the show

82
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,240
is a medically-based conspiracy theory?

83
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,720
Yes.

84
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,280
But more serious examples are parents choosing not to vaccinate their children against diseases

85
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,960
because of unsubstantiated ideas that they are harmful.

86
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,879
Unsubstantiated means not supported by evidence.

87
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,080
That's right.

88
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,280
Okay, now, remember the question I asked earlier, Rob?

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,480
Around what proportion of the US population believes that the assassination of President John F. Kennedy

90
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,960
wasn't the result of a lone gunman.

91
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,280
Is it A, 6%?

92
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,520
B, 16% or C, 60%.

93
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,080
Well, I said B, 16%.

94
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,439
And you were wrong today, Rob, aren't you afraid?

95
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,200
The answer is actually C, 60%.

96
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,879
And this statistic comes from a Gallup poll from 2013

97
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,200
that suggests a clear majority of Americans still believe others

98
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:38,560
besides the gunman Lee Harvey Oswald were involved.

99
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,079
That's more than I expected.

100
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:43,120
But they might have a point.

101
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:44,639
There you go again.

102
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,959
Come on, Rob.

103
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,000
Now let me remind everybody what words we've heard today.

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,159
They are to fake something.

105
00:05:52,879 --> 00:06:00,159
Gallable, conspiracy theory, susceptible, cover up, trait, paranoia,

106
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:04,959
off the beaten track, paranormal, unsubstantiated.

107
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,759
That's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

108
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,120
Please join it again soon.

109
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,759
Bye-bye.

110
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,239
Bye.
