Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,480
And I'm Sam.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,600
Have you always wanted to learn to dance the tango,

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,160
do a magic trick or skydive?

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,879
If so, perhaps you need a bucket list,

8
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,399
a list of all the things you want to do before you die.

9
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,320
That's the topic of our programme.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,920
Bucket lists have been called the graces' hits of your life,

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,560
and have helped some people overcome anxiety and fear of following their dreams.

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,200
But they've also been accused of limiting the imagination by encouraging people

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,560
to follow someone else's idea of the perfect life.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,439
So what would be on your bucket list, Neil? Are you a skydiving kind of person?

15
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,439
Not really. Bungie jumping may be,

16
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,079
as long as someone checked the elastic rope.

17
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:00,960
How about you?

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,560
One thing I've always wanted to do is swim with dolphins.

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,280
Well, you're not alone there, Sam,

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,280
because swimming with dolphins is one of the most commonly included personal goals on bucket lists.

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,319
But which of the following things do you think tops the list?

22
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,560
That's my quiz question for today.

23
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,120
Is it a swimming with dolphins,

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,600
B, getting a tattoo, or C, seeing the Northern Lights?

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,320
I'll go for A, swimming with dolphins,

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,280
one, because it's something I really want to do,

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,640
and two, because I've heard so many stories about how it improves your mental health.

28
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,719
Well, that was certainly true in the case of blogger Annette White.

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,360
She listed hundreds of things she wanted to accomplish from learning Spanish

30
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,240
to hanging out with penguins in Antarctica,

31
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,920
as a way of improving her psychological well-being.

32
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,439
Here she is talking to Claudia Hammond for BBC Radio Force program All in the Mind.

33
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,439
You said you started all this to try to help you overcome your anxiety,

34
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,640
and has it done that?

35
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:06,719
It definitely has, and I feel that the reason is,

36
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,680
because that promise to live my bucket list

37
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,680
really continuously pushes the comfort zone,

38
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,319
you know, to its limits, and beyond it.

39
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,879
So every time I can have a chance to step out of my comfort zone,

40
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:23,919
a little piece of that fear of the unknown is removed,

41
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,319
and replaced with a little piece of empowerment,

42
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,439
and by continuously doing that, the size of my fear bubble has gotten smaller.

43
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,719
Annette feels that choosing adventurous goals for her bucket list helps her step

44
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:42,240
outside of her comfort zone, the situations where she feels safe and comfortable,

45
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,800
but where her ability and determination are not really being tested.

46
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,320
Moving out of her comfort zone has helped Annette

47
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,159
replace her feelings of fear with feelings of empowerment,

48
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,439
the process of becoming stronger and more confident,

49
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,439
especially in controlling her life.

50
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,439
Well, that all sounds pretty good to me,

51
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,960
but not everyone is convinced that bucket lists can really help people like Annette

52
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,920
in the long run.

53
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,920
Here's clinical psychologist Linda Blair to explain why.

54
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,520
I'm not really in favor of bucket lists.

55
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,800
There are a couple of reasons.

56
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,320
Most of all, you're kind of fooling yourself with a bucket list.

57
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,400
We fear death more than I think we fear anything else in our existence,

58
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,680
because we can't predict it,

59
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,879
and because we don't know what it's like,

60
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,800
because nobody comes back and tells us.

61
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,240
And when you create a bucket list,

62
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,280
something to do before you kick the bucket,

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,800
the idea that you're giving yourself is that you can somehow control

64
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,920
when and what death is going to be all about.

65
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,879
We only make sense of our lives at the end of it.

66
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,039
A bucket list takes you away from the chance to be spontaneous,

67
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,680
and I think it's so delicious to be able to say,

68
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,879
that's an opportunity. Oh, I'll do that.

69
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,599
Linda thinks some people use bucket lists as a coping strategy

70
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,719
to try to control something uncontrollable.

71
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,120
Death.

72
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,959
In this way, they're fooling or deceiving themselves,

73
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,040
trying to make themselves believe something they know is not really true.

74
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,360
And by having a checklist of adventures to tick off before they die,

75
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,879
people might lose the chance to be spontaneous,

76
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,399
to act in a natural or impulsive way without planning.

77
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,759
Linda also uses an unusual expression,

78
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,560
which gave bucket list its name in the first place.

79
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,040
A bucket list is all the things you want to do before you kick the bucket,

80
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,360
an informal way of saying die.

81
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,399
Kick the bucket is an old English expression that was even used by Shakespeare.

82
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:55,360
It refers to kicking the bucket away from under the feet of a hanging man,

83
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,120
leaving him to drop to his death.

84
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,519
Well, anyway, I hope I don't kick the bucket before I've had a chance to tell you

85
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,000
the correct answer to today's quiz.

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,480
Remember, I asked you which personal goal was most often included in bucket list?

87
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,600
I said, hey, swimming with dolphins.

88
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,680
But the actual answer was, see, seeing the Northern Lights.

89
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,879
Well, maybe we could combine the two in a single trip.

90
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,480
And then get a tattoo.

91
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,920
That would be spontaneous.

92
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,759
Today, we've been discussing bucket lists.

93
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,240
List of all the things you want to do before you kick the bucket,

94
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,959
an informal way of saying die.

95
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,000
Bucket lists can be a great way to feel empowered,

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,879
stronger and more in control of your life,

97
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,439
because they take you out of your comfort zone,

98
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,959
comfortable situations which are safe, but not challenging.

99
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:51,439
But others think you're fooling or deceiving yourself if you think bucket lists can really help you

100
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,959
control your life.

101
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,160
In fact, they might even make you less spontaneous,

102
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,399
less able to act in natural, sudden and impulsive ways.

103
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,360
That's all from us now.

104
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,759
One go and make some plans for all the things you would like to achieve in your life.

105
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:10,240
And start having adventures before we see you next time here at 6 Minute English

106
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,680
from BBC Learning English.

107
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,000
Bye.

108
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,279
Bye bye.
