5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,880
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,519
I'm Dan and joining me today is Neil, hi Neil.

7
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,320
Hi there Dan.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,600
You're a married man, Neil.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,960
When you were wed, did your wife change her family name?

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes she did.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,199
Was that her choice?

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,600
Oh yes, yes she didn't like her old name.

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,679
So for her it was a win-win.

14
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:30,719
How about you?

15
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,359
Well my wife wanted to keep her surname

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,920
but was forced to a dot mine because that was the law where we got married.

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,640
Would you have thought about taking her name?

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,439
That's what we're talking about in this 6 Minute English,

19
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,359
a husband taking a wife's name after marriage.

20
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,799
Or that, six related words and our quiz question.

21
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:52,399
Okay, let's have the question.

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,519
In which country has it been forbidden since 1789 for a citizen

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,680
to change their name legally even after marriage?

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,520
Is it Asia-Pen, be France or sea turkey?

25
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,879
I'm going to go for be France and we'll see if you're right later.

26
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:15,120
Now traditionally in the UK, when a man and a woman get married,

27
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,719
the woman takes the man's family name and this replaces her maiden name.

28
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,640
A maiden name is the surname a woman had before she was married.

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,599
Now this all dates back to the Norman invasion of England back in 1066.

30
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,560
They introduced the idea that when a woman married a man,

31
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,799
she became his property.

32
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,159
Now as a result of this, she took his name.

33
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,719
These days many women elect to keep their maiden name upon marriage

34
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,799
or combine it with their new husbands in some way.

35
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,159
Sometimes by making the name double-barrelled.

36
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,599
A double-barrelled name is two names that are connected by a hyphen,

37
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,119
such as Joan Smith.

38
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,479
However, a growing number of couples in Western culture are doing it differently.

39
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,959
When they get married, the husband elects to take the wife's surname.

40
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,000
In a BBC article about surnames and marriage,

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,039
Rory dear love, formerly Rory Cook,

42
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,560
talks about why he decided to take his wife's surname.

43
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,599
He said that he wasn't really attached to his name anyway,

44
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,599
to him it didn't make any difference.

45
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,199
Well, he's not alone.

46
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,039
A recent study of 2,000 UK adults by Appinium,

47
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,359
a strategic insight agency,

48
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:30,639
suggested that one in 10 millennial men,

49
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:36,079
currently between 18 and 34 years old, fall into this category.

50
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:39,759
Charlie Shaw, a Tibetan Buddhist meditation instructor

51
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,079
who took his wife's name when they married last year,

52
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:46,400
said that it was an opportunity to acknowledge the unseen patriarchal bias

53
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,560
and sexism in our society.

54
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,280
Patriarchal means controlled by men,

55
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,319
and a bias is the unfair support or opposition to a person, thing or idea.

56
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,960
Many traditional societies were patriarchal,

57
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,080
but modern UK society is less like that.

58
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,719
Everyone is meant to be equal.

59
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,080
Ah yes, but that's the unseen part.

60
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,560
And there's the social view of things too.

61
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,159
Rachel Robnet, a researcher at the University of Nevada,

62
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,919
surveyed a number of people in the US and UK

63
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,400
and found that the husbands of women who keep their maiden names

64
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,479
are viewed as feminine, while the women are believed to

65
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,919
wear the trousers.

66
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,560
If you wear the trousers in a relationship,

67
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,560
it means you have the control and make the decisions for both people.

68
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,719
I wondered about that, so I went out into London and asked people

69
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,599
what they thought about a man who took his wife's name when they got married.

70
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,359
Here's what they said.

71
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:49,120
I don't think it's a bad idea.

72
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,159
Oh, my dad's 55 and he took my mother's surname.

73
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,359
If people want to do it, then all the power to them.

74
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:57,519
I must think it's each to their own, really.

75
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,759
Yeah, it doesn't hurt anybody, and it's no different from when we're taking a man's name.

76
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,599
The only reason I think that anybody should take someone else's surname

77
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,079
is just for like the creation of a family unit,

78
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,759
but if it's just out of principle, they don't agree.

79
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,799
It seems that the people I talk to are comfortable with the idea.

80
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,079
Yes, most said that people are free to do what they want.

81
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,000
One woman even mentioned the creation of a family unit.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
A unit is a group of people living or working together.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,920
A typical family unit would be two parents and some children.

84
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,600
Well, that answers that question.

85
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,080
People don't seem to mind who takes whose name?

86
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,120
Speaking of questions, how about our quiz question?

87
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,759
I asked you in which country it has been forbidden since 1789

88
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,399
for a citizen to change their name legally even after marriage.

89
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,759
A. Japan, B. France, or C. Turkey.

90
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,519
And I said B. France.

91
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,240
And you were spot on as usual, Neil.

92
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,480
Let's take a look at the vocabulary, shall we?

93
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,879
First, we had maiden name.

94
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,480
This is a woman's family name before she is married.

95
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,399
My mother refused to give up her maiden name to my father when she got married.

96
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,079
Then we had double-barreled.

97
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,519
A double-barreled name is two names that are joined by a hyphen.

98
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:13,439
Can you think of any famous examples?

99
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,159
Well, there's the Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla Parker-Boles for one.

100
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:22,079
She's married to Prince Charles, next in line to the English throne.

101
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,839
Then we had patriarchal.

102
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,039
If something is patriarchal, it is controlled by men.

103
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,199
The feminine equivalent is matriarchal controlled by women.

104
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,399
Then we had bias.

105
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:37,599
A bias is unfair support or opposition to a person thing or idea.

106
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:41,120
Many fans are biased in favor of their football team.

107
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,280
Then we had where the trousers.

108
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,560
If you wear the trousers, you have the control and make the decisions for both people.

109
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,199
Do you wear the trousers in your marriage, Neil?

110
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,600
Oh, we both wear the trousers in my marriage.

111
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,800
Thank you, Dan.

112
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,480
Then we had unit.

113
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,759
A unit is a group of people living or working together,

114
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,040
like the BBC Learning English team or unit.

115
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,199
