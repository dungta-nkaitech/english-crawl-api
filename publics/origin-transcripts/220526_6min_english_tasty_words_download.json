    "text": "Julie McDowall and her younger sister, Jen McCready, have synaesthesia, a neurological condition where two or more senses mix together. When synesthetes, as they’re called, hear a word, their sense of taste also becomes activated. Words produce specific tastes on their tongues. For example, when Jen hears the name of her daughter, Sophia, she tastes pink marshmallows! And the name ‘Leo’ tastes like noodles."

    "speaker": "Sam",

    "speaker": "Sam",
    "text": "OK. Don’t worry, Neil - I’ll reveal the answer later in the programme. Synaesthesia isn’t only about people, like Julie and Jen, who taste words - it can be a mixing of any of our senses. A synesthete may hear colours or see sounds. In fact, there could be as many as 150 different types of synaesthesia."

    "text": "This is enjoyable, it’s never anything that causes … the only thing I would say is it’s quite hard if you’re trying to eat healthily because if you hear a word that maybe tastes like tuna, I’ll be like, ‘Oh, I need to get a tune baguette now’… You know, it’s almost like being pregnant and having a craving… words can be so vivid that you want to eat that – that’s the only negative I would say about it."

    "speaker": "craving",
    "text": "For Jen, the only drawback to synaesthesia is that it can be hard to eat healthily because hearing certain words produces a craving – a strong feeling of wanting a particular food."

    "text": "One of the problems with synaesthesia is for many years it’s been dismissed, and it’s been viewed as people with an overactive imagination, something not real but actually what research in recent years has taught us is that actually it does have an underlying neurological and genetic basis."

And with an estimated 4% of the world population having some form of sense mixing, a world of new and exciting possibilities is opening up to millions."
