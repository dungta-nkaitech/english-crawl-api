Traditionally, it’s humans working as nurses or carers who take care of elderly people - those people who are too old or too unwell to look after themselves."

It does have hands, it can wave... when you ask for privacy, it does turn around and sort of cover its eyes with its hands but that's the most it does.  It doesn't grip anything, it doesn't move anything because we're more interested to see how it works as a companion - having something there to talk to, to converse with, to interact with."
