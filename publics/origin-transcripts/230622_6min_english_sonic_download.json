There are some well-known English expressions that make a link between seeing and eating. ‘Your eyes are bigger than your belly’ means you have taken more food than you can eat; and the saying you eat with your eyes first means that food seems more desirable when it looks good on the plate."

In this programme we'll be eating with our ears as we investigate the link between sound and our tastebuds. And, as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."

The idea that sounds influence taste might seem strange, but the food-processing companies that produce some of our most familiar food and drinks have long known that sounds equal sales. In the UK, for example, the chocolate company, Cadbury, hired the London Contemporary Orchestra to perform classical music tunes symbolising each flavour of their Dairy Milk chocolates. So, which background sound did whisky-makers, Singletons, used to advertise their scotch whisky? Was it:"

After years studying how our brains process information, he believes sound plays a much bigger role in how we taste our food than we think, something he explained to Mike Johnson, presenter of BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:"

    "text": "Professor Spence uses onomatopoeia to describe some sounds. Onomatopoeia is when a word sounds like what it means, words like 'buzz', ‘zoom’ and ‘whack’. He uses the word sizzle for the hissing sound made by frying meat, and describes a coffee machine using the word gurgle - the low pleasant sound liquids make when flowing quickly through a narrow space. Professor Spence thinks that hearing these sounds while eating psychologically intensifies the flavours of food."

Here she interviews one of them, Amy Frishkey, head of music design company, Mood Media, for BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:"
