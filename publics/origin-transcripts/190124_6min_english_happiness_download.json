    "text": "Millennials and perhaps older people are better at remembering wabi-sabi – this traditional Japanese concept around celebrating imperfection, which I think is something so helpful these days, especially for women – it's this idea that there is a beauty in ageing, it's to be celebrated rather than trying to disguise it, or trying to cover up the scars instead you gild them with kintsugi – if you break a pot instead of chucking it away, you mend it with gold lacquer so the scars, rather than being hidden, are highlighted in pure gold… We all have laughter lines and rather than being ashamed of them, they're something to be celebrated."
  },
  {
    "order": 20,

So there's this sense that in a lot of our comedy, in a lot of our approach to life you just sort of… you get out there, you go for a dog walk, you have a boiled egg and soldiers ['soldiers' in this case are small slices of toast that you can dip into your egg and eat], and we do sort of get on with things – it's a coping mechanism, it's not perfect but it's worked for many Brits for a while."
