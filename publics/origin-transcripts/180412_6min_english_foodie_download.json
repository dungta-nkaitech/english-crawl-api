    "order": 17,
    "speaker": "Angela Hartnett",
    "text": "My idea of a foodie is the very European idea that people go and shop every day, they understand one end of a pig from another. And maybe that's a bit romantic but I look at my mother, I look at my grandmother and our background, you know. They made food, they knew about what was expensive, they knew about quality and stuff like that."

    "speaker": "Rob",
    "text": "I hope so, but the point Angela Hartnett is making is that a true foodie has a good understanding, for example, of the different parts of an animal that are used in cooking and what they are used for. She says that idea might be a bit romantic."

    "speaker": "Rob",
    "text": "She commented that food was very expensive here in Britain. Many people don’t have enough money to buy it, as she said it’s not affordable. She thinks we might be in danger of not being able to feed out families cheaply."

  },
  {
    "order": 27,
    "speaker": "Rob",
    "text": "Sure, the phrase to be in danger of is followed by a gerund and it means that there is the possibility of something bad happening. It’s not happened yet, but it could happen."

    "speaker": "Neil",

    "order": 33,
    "speaker": "Rob",

  },
  {
    "order": 37,
    "speaker": "Rob",
    "text": "Yes, a little bit: a very simple but a very natural conversational phrase that means a small amount."
  },
  {
    "order": 38,
    "speaker": "Neil",
    "text": "The next word was the adjective romantic. Not used in the context of love here though was it?"
  },
  {
    "order": 39,
    "speaker": "Rob",
    "text": "No, it wasn't. A romantic idea here is one that is not realistic but is an imagined perfect situation. For example, we have a very romantic view of our childhoods when every Christmas was a white Christmas and every summer holiday was baking hot and spent on the beach. Of course, it wasn’t like that at all. In reality both Christmas and summer were cold and rainy."
  },
  {
    "order": 40,
    "speaker": "Neil",
