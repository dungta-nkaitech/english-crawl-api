An adolescent is someone aged 10 to 19, between childhood and adulthood. With that in mind, it's no wonder parents are worried. To help with this, the US is currently in the process of regulating social media apps for teenagers. Some scientists think the UK should do the same."

In this programme, we’ll be discussing how social media affects teenagers, and, as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."
