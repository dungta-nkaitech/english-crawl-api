We use it more frequently as part of the word deodorant, which is something we buy to cover up what we think of as the unpleasant natural smell of our bodies. These odorants, he said, can act as the trigger or catalyst for these memories. Both the nouns trigger and catalyst refer to something that causes a particular response.
