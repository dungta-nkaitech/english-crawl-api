You reminded me of a famous quote by one of history’s greatest leaders: The world has enough for everyone's need, but not everyone's greed. But who said it? Was it:"

Greedy people feel good when they choose the stuff they want, and this happens at the unconscious, emotional level of the brain, meaning there’s little conscious awareness about how greedy actions might affect others, or be unfair."
