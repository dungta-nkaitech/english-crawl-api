On dry land, at sea level, the pressure or weight of all the air above us is known as an atmosphere. How far underwater do you have to go until the weight of water is equal in pressure to another atmosphere? Is it:"

In 2012 he reached a depth of 253 metres. Recently he spoke on the BBC World Service radio programme, Outlook about his experiences. He spoke about how he trained himself to hold his breath for a long time. Lungs are the organs in the body that hold the air that we breathe in, and he says that he trains himself not by starting with a big breath, but when his lungs are already empty. Why is that?"

  {
    "order": 12,
    "speaker": "lungsurgelungs,urgeurge",
    "text": "The reason why I do the empty lungs is that the urge to breathe comes earlier and this is when the training starts. Because when you hold your breath on full lungs, the urge to breathe comes like a few minutes in, but the time up to that point is no training at all. Only the time you have the urge to breathe and fight against it, that’s the time you’re actually training."

    "text": "Exactly. Our body and brain is telling us – go on, breathe, take a breath! This strong feeling to do something is called an urge. To hold your breath for a long time you have to ignore that urge, you have to fight against it. So to train to do that, it’s a waste of time taking a big breath, because holding your breath when you don’t need to breathe isn’t difficult – you have to practise fighting against that urge to breathe."
