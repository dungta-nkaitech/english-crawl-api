So who tried to dampen enthusiasm and how did they do it? Well, during and after the First World War, women’s football became really popular with crowds of up to 50,000 watching games. It may have been popular with the crowds, but it wasn’t so popular with the men who ran the game, the English Football Association. Here’s Gemma Clarke again."

Right, before we review today’s vocabulary, let’s have the answer to today’s question. So I asked you, Sam, when was the first official Women’s World Cup? Was it…"
