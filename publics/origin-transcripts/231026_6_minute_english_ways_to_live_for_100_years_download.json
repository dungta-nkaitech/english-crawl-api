Of all the many factors for long life such as diet, exercise, and keeping active, human relationships are among the most important. People who are more connected with others, and have warmer relationships live longer and stay healthier. And according to psychiatrist Robert Waldinger, talking here with BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry, those relationships don't necessarily have to be with humans:"

So one size doesn't fit all when it comes to how many relationships you need to have a healthy life. It doesn't have to be done with another human… we know that pets provide us with a great deal of comfort and joy and pets can calm us down."

This is very, very hard, this will be the most complex things we can do. And the third scenario, and this is a very exciting scenario, and we have some evidence that it works, is the Peter Pan scenario. Peter Pan didn't grow old - the idea that you take people when they're 20 or 30 and give them a treatment every few months or every year. And you'll basically erase their ageing and let them age very, very slowly, which also will mean probably that they'll pass their 115 year maximum potential lifespan."
