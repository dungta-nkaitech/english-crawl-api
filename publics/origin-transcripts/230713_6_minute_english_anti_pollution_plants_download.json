    "speaker": "Beth",
    "text": "OK, Neil. We'll find out the correct answer later. Phytoremediating plants are certainly needed in one of the most oil polluted places on Earth – the delta of the River Niger in Nigeria. Ever since oil, known by the nickname, black gold, was discovered there in the 1950s, it's become central to Nigeria's economy. But oil spills have devastated the region’s landscape, and there is mistrust between local communities and the multinational oil companies working there."
