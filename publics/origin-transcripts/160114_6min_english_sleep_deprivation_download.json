    "text": "Not much, to be honest. I usually sleep like a log – and that means very heavily indeed! But sometimes my own snoring wakes me up, and then I can find it hard to get back to sleep. Snoring, for those of you who don't know, means breathing in a noisy way through your mouth or nose while you're asleep. [snores] … like that… How about you, Alice?"

It's the caffeine in coffee – a chemical that makes you feel more awake – which can stop you from sleeping at night. But there are so many things that can keep us awake these days."

They don't have artificial light, electricity, batteries, or any of the gadgets that we rely on today."

    "text": "Their sleep was not that different from ours. The range of sleep period was about 6.9 to 8.5 hours. If you actually measure sleep in current populations in the United States or in Europe they're definitely at the low end of what's been reported. They certainly don't sleep a lot less than we do but they clearly don't sleep more."

    "speaker": "insomnia",
    "text": "Professor Jerome Siegel found that people in these communities don't go to bed until several hours after sundown – just like us! But one big difference is that very few of them suffer from insomnia – which means having difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep."

    "speaker": "hunter-gatherers",
    "text": "Now, I don't have a problem with insomnia. And hunter-gatherers – people who live by hunting animals and gathering plants to eat – don't either – probably because they take a lot of physical exercise during the day."

    "speaker": "soundly",
    "text": "Yes, that's right. Taking exercise is an important factor in sleeping soundly – or well – at night. But these days our minds can be so active that it becomes very difficult to fall asleep. Let's listen to Professor Kevin Morgan, from Loughborough University here in England, talking about how cognitive behavioural therapy can be used to help people with insomnia."

    "speaker": "Professor Kevin Morgan, Loughborough University, England",
    "text": "If you have a train of thoughts which would otherwise keep you awake one way of dealing with this is to block those thoughts. What I'd like you to do is repeat the word 'the' in your mind at irregular intervals – the the the the the the the the the – what you'll find (is) that the mind space required to do this blocks out almost everything else."
  },
  {
    "order": 24,
    "speaker": "irregular",
    "text": "So Professor Kevin Morgan suggests saying one word over and over again at irregular intervals – irregular in this context means not spaced out evenly. Doing it can help to block out the thoughts that are stopping you from getting to sleep. It sounds like a very simple solution. I wonder if it works?"
