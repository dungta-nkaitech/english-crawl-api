It looks red because of rust – iron oxide on the surface, which is red and, interestingly that look can change. And we saw that in 2018 when there was a global dust storm – Mars, instead of looking red looked a little orange, and that changing of colour might have made the civilisations watching Mars maybe uneasy to see something immutable in our night sky changing colours."
