    "speaker": "Neil",

    "text": "Most of the evidence we have now on air pollution is that we continue to see health benefits by reducing pollution, even when you're below the target value. So, just because the city meets a particular value, there is still an incentive to continue to improve air quality, because the health benefits continue to build up as you do that. So, targets are very good at focusing the mind, but they shouldn't be the only thing that we're considering."

  },

    "speaker": "Neil",
    "text": "And, of course, changing to electric-powered cars is one way to do this. There’s more of an incentive to do this now, at least in the UK, because the government has said new diesel and petrol cars and vans will be banned from 2040."

So, low emission zones are one way to reduce concentrations, but they are not, in isolation, going to be the solution."
