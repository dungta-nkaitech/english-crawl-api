    "text": "Wow! Be in orbit - it means be in space and following the Earth's curvature. Well, the view must be nice from up there. But the reality of becoming an astronaut is pretty hard. And it's the subject of today's show! Did you know that less than 600 people have been into space so far?"

    "speaker": "claustrophobia",
    "text": "Well, I'd say claustrophobia – and that means: fear of being in a small space. That might be a problem because the space capsules are small and you're with the same people for months at a time."
  },

    "text": "Yes, that's right. Well, astronauts are bound to get on each other's nerves sometimes! To get on someone's nerves means: to annoy them."

    "speaker": "Alice",
    "text": "Yes, I can confirm that. Anyway, the challenge of being an astronaut doesn't stop here. In the space capsule, astronauts have to put up with extremely difficult conditions. Like zero gravity, for example."
  },
  {
    "order": 17,
    "speaker": "Rob",

  },
  {
    "order": 18,
    "speaker": "zero gravity",
    "text": "But zero gravity – a condition where gravity is exerting no force – can lead to wasting of the bones and muscles. Astronauts take two and a half hours of exercise per day to help prevent this."
  },
  {
    "order": 19,
    "speaker": "Rob",

  },
  {
    "order": 20,
    "speaker": "Alice",
    "text": "They can practice using a virtual reality headset and special gloves. It's like playing a computer game that looks and feels like doing a spacewalk. And they also train in a swimming pool! Let's listen to Major Tim Peake, a British astronaut, talking about the preparation he did for his mission on the International Space Station."

  {
    "order": 22,
    "speaker": "INSERT",
    "text": "The way we practise spacewalk is in water. Water gives us the neutral buoyancy that we need. So we sink training modules into swimming pools and then practise the spacewalking on them. We wear very specific equipment, a pressurized spacesuit – very difficult to move in actually – it's hard to bend the fingers, it's hard to bend your arms – and it really gives you quite a difficult workout."
  },
  {
    "order": 23,
    "speaker": "buoyancy",
    "text": "British astronaut Tim Peake says water gives us buoyancy, which is the ability to float. Floating in space is similar to floating in water, so astronauts practise their spacewalk in swimming pools."
  },
  {
    "order": 24,
    "speaker": "nosedive",
    "text": "Yes. They take to the water and to the air too. Astronauts experience the feeling of weightlessness in planes. A large plane with padded walls flies to high altitude and then goes into a nosedive – or a fast and sudden fall – which creates short periods of weightlessness."

    "text": "But it's not all fun and games. Don't forget that one of the main reasons for being out on the International Space Station is to conduct research. Major Tim Peake is doing scientific experiments such as how to grow plants in space, and what effect radiation and zero gravity have on this process."

Foraging for food, for example, and your basic elements of shelter and protection, getting water… Go and live in a cave for seven days with an international crew. And it's a wonderful environment to prepare you for a mission because you are very isolated."
  },
