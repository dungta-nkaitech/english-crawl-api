We now think that that system kicked in, maybe not on the first actual case of Covid, but certainly within a couple of months of the first case, it seems. So that’s quite quick. And then from that point, to actually getting a full genome, genetic sequence of the virus, was very quick – and getting that published and publically available – and then rapidly developing diagnostic tests and vaccines now – that’s really worked well."
