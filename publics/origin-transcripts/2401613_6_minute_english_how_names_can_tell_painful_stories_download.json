In this programme, we’ll be meeting two people whose family history has caused them to consider changing their name. And, as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."

In Britain, a person’s first name is also called their Christian name, and in Christianity, many names have a religious meaning. The name John, for example, means ‘God is good’. Anderson Jeremiah is the Bishop of Edmonton. He was born in South India, but he doesn’t have a traditional Indian sounding name. Here, Bishop Jeremiah explains the roots of his name to BBC World Service programme, Heart and Soul:"

He was the first educational missionary who came and worked and set up several schools in South India, who had very noble ambitions, but also as with any missionaries, he was a big collaborator of the colonial establishment at that point in time, so he has a very a strong baggage that goes with it. So, Anderson is my Christian name, and Jeremiah is my dad's name."
