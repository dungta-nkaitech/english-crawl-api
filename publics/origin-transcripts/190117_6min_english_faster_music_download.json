    "speaker": "Rob",

In the old days, radio DJs – disc jockeys who played the records – loved to talk over that bit! Now we need to get to the lyrical content – that's the lyrics or the words of the song - as soon as possible."

That's because if a song isn't streamed for more than 30 seconds, it doesn't register a play – it doesn't get measured or recorded as a play – so it doesn't make money."
