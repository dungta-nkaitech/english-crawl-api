So that’s why you get that sort of same response."

    "order": 25,
    "speaker": "Dan",
    "text": "Yes, it seems so. When we are hungry the level of sugar in our blood is lower and this causes an increase in particular hormones. Hormones are the chemicals we make in our bodies that control certain biological and psychological functions."

    "speaker": "Neil",
