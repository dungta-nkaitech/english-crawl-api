We’ll be looking at experiments by scientists in the US into the Buddhist practice of meditation. We’ll find out how Tibetan monks use meditation techniques to focus better and manage their emotions."

    "speaker": "Neil",
    "text": "There’s a lot more to it than that. After all, Buddhist meditation is an ancient practice – even science, according to some. Tibetan Buddhism, as embodied by the Dalai Lama, is what many people think of when you mention meditation. Which brings me to my quiz question."

    "speaker": "Neil",

    "text": "When I first met His Holiness the Dalai Lama it was 1972. He challenged me, he said, ‘I understand that you’ve been using tools of modern neuroscience to study anxiety and depression. Why can’t you use those same tools to study kindness and to study compassion?’"

    "text": "Very high levels of gamma oscillations – now that’s brain waves showing increased connections between different parts of the brain. This is what you or I might experience as a flash of insight – a moment of sudden understanding and clarity. For us, it might last less than a second. But for these experienced Buddhist monks, the gamma waves lasted minutes! Furthermore, as Richard Davidson explains, brain changes as a result of meditation can be long lasting."

    "speaker": "Richard Davidson",
    "text": "There is no question at this point in time based upon the current science that has been conducted over the last 10 years, that meditation can change the brain in enduring ways; and the circuits that are involved are multiple, but they include circuits that are important for regulating attention and regulating emotion."

    "speaker": "neuroplasticity",
    "text": "So, this was proof of neuroplasticity – our brain’s ability to change in response to conscious effort. In other words, the meditating monks were intentionally remoulding their minds in more positive ways!"
