Movie subtitles are written ahead of time, but subtitling for live TV has to be done in the moment, as the person is speaking.  This can lead to mistakes - sometimes very funny ones, including a subtitle which appeared in an interview for the BBC Six O’Clock News in 2019. But what did the subtitle say? Was it:"

The translated subtitles of foreign films are great for learning languages, letting you read a word and hear how its pronounced at the same time. And because subtitles describe everything, from monster squelches to bombs exploding, it’s a great way to learn new adjectives. Here’s subtitler Karli Witkowska explaining to BBC Radio 4 programme Word of Mouth how her choice of adjective creates emotion for the viewer:"
