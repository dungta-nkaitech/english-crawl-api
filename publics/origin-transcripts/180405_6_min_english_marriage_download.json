I think it's a bit of an archaic concept these days and I'm a bit of a commitment phobe – I don't like the idea of signing a piece of paper that says I have to be with someone for the rest of my life and can never escape from that person I suppose – although I am in a very happy relationship at the moment."

    "text": "So that was one of his problems with marriage, but he also said that he was a commitment phobe. The suffix phobe means someone who is afraid of something. In some cases it can also be used as a standalone word, but it means the same. So a commitment phobe is someone who is afraid of, or doesn’t like the idea of commitment."

    "speaker": "Rob",
    "text": "You are definitely right. The answer is 239,000 or 239,020 to be precise. That figure was 3.4% lower than 2014. So what do relationship experts think is the reason fewer people are getting married?"
  },
  {
    "order": 29,
    "speaker": "Neil",
    "text": "Well there could be lots of reasons. In some countries the way society is changing means that there is less pressure to get married or stay married. As a result, there are more divorces. So perhaps children of divorced parents are less likely to get married themselves."
