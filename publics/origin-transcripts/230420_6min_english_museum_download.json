The British Museum contains thousands of important artefacts – objects of special historical interest, including ancient Egyptian mummies, an Aztec serpent, and the Rosetta Stone. In fact, London has museums on every subject, from trains to fashion."

One is that all societies begin from a very rough base… We're all…our ancestors were hunter-gatherers at one stage, and then they go through the stage of farming, industry… all this while they're getting smarter and smarter, their brains are getting bigger and bigger, and they’re moving from primitive magic to sophisticated religion, then maybe on to science. So, it's onwards and upwards. And that's the imperial idea… and we're going to help these other poor benighted people up the ladder with us. And opposed to this there's this other 19 century ideology which says, ‘no, this is an imperialist myth. We have our own culture. There are no better or worse cultures, there are just national cultures’."

According to this view, white European culture was best because it was the most advanced, so it was their duty to help local cultures up the ladder, meaning to advance or make progress.

Firstly, since many of these treasures are hundreds of years old, to whom should they be returned? What’s more, the history behind these objects is complicated. In the case of the Benin bronzes, for example, questions can be asked about the actions of local leaders, as well as the European powers."
