And you might be interested to know that dressing up in second-hand clothes is back in fashion – well sort of. And that's what we're discussing today – is looking like you're dressing in charity shop clothes a new fashion statement?"

Scumbro combines the word 'scummy' which means 'dirty and messy' with the word 'bro',  which is an informal way of referring to a boy or man. So scumbro is a fashion for men – but women can adopt it too."

And I think, like most of these trends, they're started by celebrities and then, I mean look, it's been picked up by everybody by the sounds of things."

These are very, very expensive items – you mentioned the labels Prada, Versace, Gucci, Supreme – while it's basically about looking simultaneously like you've made no effort, but the underlying thing is you do need to see the effort has gone in there."

    "text": "No don't be rummaging! The trick seems to be to look like you've not made any effort but at the same time, you're show you have made an effort! And that's the meaning of the word simultaneously – doing one thing at the same time as another thing."

Some people even buy these clothes because it is all they can afford – but the irony here is some people are choosing to pay lots and lots of money to look like they're wearing second-hand clothes – and the charity shops aren't making any money from it."
