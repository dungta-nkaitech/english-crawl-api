You sort things into three different buckets: one you label as 'to keep', one as 'to get rid of', one as 'maybe to get rid of'. Get rid of, by the way, means to remove something you don't want. It's the 'maybe' bucket that's tricky, isn't it? – You never know if you might need something in the future."
