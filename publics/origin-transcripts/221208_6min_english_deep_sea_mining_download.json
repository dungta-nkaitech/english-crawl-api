The idea, known as deep-sea mining, could provide the metals like copper, nickel and cobalt which are needed for the green technology used in electric car batteries and other renewable energy. But could deep-sea mining actually damage delicate ocean ecosystems as well?"

Mammals like dolphins and whales represent a tiny amount of all marine biodiversity - the thousands of animal species living in the sea. Even all the different types of fish combined make up less than 3% of all living things in the ocean. So, according to recent estimates by Unesco oceanographers, how many different marine species have their home in the ocean? Is it:"

Deep-sea mining is supported by some scientists because it could provide the raw materials, especially metals, needed to power electric cars. Amongst them is, Bramley Murton, a professor of marine biology at Southampton’s National Oceanographic Centre. Here he outlines the problem to BBC World Service’s, Science in Action."

    "text": "As in so many things in life, there's a real kind of paradox or a conundrum. The global grid capacity by 2050 will have to increase by three times. Electrical car ownership is set to increase by a factor of 25. Solar and wind generation is going to grow by a factor of a hundred. All of these things which we need to do to decarbonise are going to require raw materials and metals in particular. So, as a society we’re faced with this conundrum. We need to decarbonise."

    "text": "Professor Murton describes the situation using two words. Firstly, he calls it a conundrum – a problem that is very difficult to solve. He also calls it a paradox – a situation that seems impossible because it contains two opposite ideas. Deep-sea mining could damage the ocean, but paradoxically it might provide rare metals needed to decarbonise the planet."

My concern is that it really will be opening a door to something much more than those tests – it’s leading down a rather slippery slope I think, towards this getting permission for deep-sea mining to be open on a commercial scale."
