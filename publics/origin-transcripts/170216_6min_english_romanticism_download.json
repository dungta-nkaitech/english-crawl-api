    "speaker": "benchmark",
    "text": "True, it might not be a realistic benchmark, and by that I mean 'a standard from which other things are judged'. So we grow up hearing these romantic stories, which leads us to develop an idea of what a relationship is meant to be… and then we get disappointed by the real thing?"

    "text": "Well, to put it bluntly, yes. The romantic ideal is just that – an idealised version, or perfect version, of a relationship. But it often leaves out the nitty-gritty, meaning 'practical details'. Details like work, stress, children… all of the things that we have to deal with in everyday life."
