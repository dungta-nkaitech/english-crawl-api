Those aged 25 to 34 are most likely to be involved with 37% thought to run a sideline of some kind. A sideline also describes an extra job you do alongside your main job. BBC Radio 5 Live spoke to someone whose side hustle was so satisfying that that it turned into her day job. Here is Elspeth Jackson, founder of Ragged Life, to explain why."

But now I don't think I could go back to one of these big companies because you'd essentially be sacrificing the flexibility which is something I've become very accustomed to now."
