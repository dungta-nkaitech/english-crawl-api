And that seems to exercise the sort of executive parts of our brain. Those parts of the brain are kind of stronger and fitter when it comes to resisting some kind of damage from the stroke."

    "text": "So when a bilingual speaker switches – or changes – from one language to another – this exercises the executive parts of their brain, making it stronger and fitter. And because the brain is stronger, it's able to resist – or prevent – damage caused by a stroke."
