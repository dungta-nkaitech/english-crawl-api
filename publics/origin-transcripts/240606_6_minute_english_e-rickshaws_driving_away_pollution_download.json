In this programme, we’ll be discussing the growing role of electric vehicles in the fight against climate change. And, as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."

While electric vehicles score better than petrol or diesel cars in most environmental tests, there’s some debate about exactly how green they are. A lot depends on how the electricity is generated in the first place, and in India more than three quarters of the electricity used continues to be generated by coal."

    "text": "I think it can be summarised in one word and its convenience. From an accessibility and affordability and efficiency point of view… and on that first point of accessiblity, the state of public transport is not as developed as it is in places like London or Singapore. There's no metro lines or fancy bus networks, and two- and three-wheelers spread in response to this lack of sufficient or high quality, frequent public transport infrastructure."

In fact, it’s now China that tops the list, showing that when it comes to green transport, bigger isn’t always better. Right, it’s time to recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme starting with two-wheeler, a vehicle with two wheels, such as a bicycle, motorbike or moped."
