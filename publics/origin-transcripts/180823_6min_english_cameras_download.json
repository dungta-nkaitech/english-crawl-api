I think while compact camera sales have really sort of dropped off a cliff, it's the lower end, cheap compacts where people have opted for a smartphone and I think manufacturers are looking at the more higher end premium cameras, high-end compacts, DSLRs, which are the ones you can attach lenses to, mirrorless cameras. So, the market's changing. And I don't think there'll be a time soon, yet, that… the smartphone will take over the camera completely."
