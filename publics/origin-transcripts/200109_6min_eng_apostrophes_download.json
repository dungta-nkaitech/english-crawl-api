For example, if I see a sign for taxis at a train station and it says taxi – apostrophe - s – aargh! Why – why? The apostrophe is not used to show there is more than one, it’s used to show there is a missing letter or that the word is a possessive – it’s just wrong! So that does kind of make my blood boil."

Is it important, though? Does it matter? After all, in spoken English there is no difference between ‘it’s’ with an apostrophe and ‘its’ without. ‘Your’ and ‘you’re’ – short for ‘you are’ sound the same. So what’s the problem in written English?"

Sometimes it can be very important to make clear if it’s a singular or plural or possessive. Another important thing to remember is that in CVs and job applications a good standard of spelling and punctuation is expected. Get it wrong and you could miss out on a good opportunity."

So if, for example, your holiday plans are up in the air, it means that there is some kind of problem and you might not be going on holiday after all. The person who founded The Apostrophe Protection Society is John Edwards. Now 96 years old he has decided to give it up. Partly because of his age, but also because he thinks that due to the impact of texting and social media he has lost the battle against bad punctuation. So why has it come to this? Here he is explaining why he thinks people aren’t bothered about using correct punctuation."
