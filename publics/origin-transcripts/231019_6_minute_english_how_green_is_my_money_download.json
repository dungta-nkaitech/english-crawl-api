John Fleetwood, who has worked in sustainable investing for decades, thinks public interest in ethical banks has ballooned in the last few years, as he told BBC Radio 4 programme, Costing the Earth:"

So, what I’m doing is to tackle that and actually to say, okay, which are the funds that are actually making a positive social and environmental impact?"
