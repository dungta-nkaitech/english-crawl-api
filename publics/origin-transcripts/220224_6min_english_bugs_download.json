But, let’s get back to food made from bugs – which is a growing trend in the Western world.  Insects are an alternative source of food and experts say they’re filled with lots of good nutrients, including amino acids and protein. And eating them could help to fight world hunger and reduce pollution."

So, to actually get someone to put it in your mouth - the easiest way we find straightaway is to try maybe, a cricket cookie or a chocolate-chip cricket cookie where you have… we are using cricket powder so you don’t actually see any insects whatsoever – you’re getting the idea of eating them so people can deal with that a bit more than actually seeing the whole insect."
