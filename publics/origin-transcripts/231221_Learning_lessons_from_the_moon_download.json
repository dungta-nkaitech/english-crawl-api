    "text": "Okay, Georgie, we’ll find out the answer at the end of the programme. In some ways, the current interest in the Moon is really more about the origins of Earth. One theory is that during the early days of the solar system, around 4 billion years ago, another planet crashed into Earth breaking off a part which then formed the Moon. Unlike the Earth’s surface, which is constantly moving, the Moon is completely still, frozen in time to create a perfectly preserved record of what happened at the birth of the solar system. Here’s astronomer, Dr Becky Smethurst, explaining more to BBC Radio 4 programme, Inside Science:"

    "text": "…Whereas on the Moon, it’s just this inert rock, there's no atmosphere so every single thing that's happened to the Moon in its four-and-a-half billion years’ worth history is still recorded there on it.  And so, if anyone's ever seen an image of the far side of the Moon, the side of the Moon that we cannot see from Earth is incredibly pockmarked. There are craters all over that thing, and so this is a really big deal when we're thinking about what happened to the early Earth as well, because we think all of the Earth's water came from impacts with comets and asteroids in the very early days of the solar system."

    "text": "The rock which makes up the Moon is inert – it doesn’t move. It’s also full of craters - large holes in the ground caused by something hitting it. The Moon has so many of these craters, it’s described as pockmarked – having a surface that’s covered in small marks and scars."

    "speaker": "big deal",
    "text": "These craters play an important part in the story. Because the Moon’s surface does not change, finding water there would explain a lot about how water, and therefore life, started on Earth. That’s why Dr Smethurst calls the Moon mission a big deal, meaning important or significant."

    "text": "That’s right. Astronomers know that comets are full of ice, and think comets brought water to Earth when they crashed into it. Evidence of those crashes has been erased by the constantly moving surfaces on Earth, but not on the Moon. So, comparing water from the Moon with water on Earth could provide scientists with vital information, as Dr Smethurst explained to BBC Radio 4’s, Inside Science:"

How long has it been there for as well. Also, various other minerals that might be there, these very heavy minerals that we know come from comets and asteroids. Again, that would be this sort of smoking gun to be like, yes this that's where this water came from and it's likely that Earth’s water came from there as well."
