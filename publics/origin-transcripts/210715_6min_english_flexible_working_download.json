Different countries have different laws about working flexibly – but here in the UK, for last 14 years, employees – workers – have had the right to request flexible working."

    "speaker": "common sensematch",
    "text": "Because of the pandemic, now everybody thinks flexible working means working from home - it doesn't, it's about common sense, what does the job need in terms of when where, how long, and what do you need and what does your family need - and how do the two match? So, flexibility really means having choice and control over when, where and how long you work, and agreeing that with your manager."
  },
  {
    "order": 17,
    "speaker": "common sense",
    "text": "So, flexible working is not just working from home – something we’ve got used to during the pandemic. It is about common sense – using our judgement to make sensible decisions."
  },
  {
    "order": 18,
    "speaker": "Match",
    "text": "So, requesting to work for two hours a day is not sensible – but being able to work from 12 until 8 instead of 9 to 5 might be. Of course, this depends on the needs of the business. And as Sarah said, you need to match your needs with that of the business. Match here means to work equally on both sides."
  },
  {
    "order": 19,
    "speaker": "inflexible",
    "text": "Getting the working conditions that suit you does require some negotiation with your manager. You need agreement from him or her – and that can be difficult if your manager is inflexible – not willing to change."
  },
  {
    "order": 20,
    "speaker": "Neil",
    "text": "But of course, in the UK at least, an employee has a right to request flexible working, and this must be considered by the employer. This law initially was just for parents with a child younger than 6 years old – or a disabled child less than 18."
  },
  {
    "order": 21,
    "speaker": "Georgina",
    "text": "But since 2014, everyone has the right to request flexible working. And that includes men."
  },
  {
    "order": 22,
    "speaker": "Neil",
    "text": "Which is an important point, as Sarah Jackson explains. Fewer men seem to have their requests for flexible working accepted – let’s find out why…"
  },
  {
    "order": 23,
    "speaker": "biasactive",
    "text": "Men, when they do ask, are more likely to be turned down, so there's a real bias there in the system and the most important thing that needs to happen here, I think, is for employers to really actively say to their men, 'we know you want to be active fathers' - because there's a whole generation of young men who do want to be active fathers - 'please use the right to request flexible working, work flexibly if you can’  because until men are enabled to be active fathers, we won't get equality at home and we certainly won't get equality in the workplace either."
  },
  {
    "order": 24,
    "speaker": "bias",
    "text": "OK, so men are more likely to have their request turned down – or rejected. And Sarah says there is a bias in the system – unfairness, treating one group of people more favourably than another."
  },
  {
    "order": 25,
    "speaker": "active",
    "text": "And this is unfair because it can prevent some men being active fathers – actually being involved with childcare. But having more active fathers can lead to equality – or fairness – at home and in the workplace."

    "speaker": "Georgina",

    "speaker": "Neil",
    "text": "And I said Mexico."
  },
  {
    "order": 28,
    "speaker": "Georgina",
    "text": "Which is correct, well done! According to the OECD, the average Mexican spends 2,255 hours at work per year – the equivalent of around 43 hours per week. Germans, on the other hand, clock up the fewest hours."
