So, in this programme, we’ll be hearing about old tech which continues to be used today. And, as usual, we’ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well."

NASA engineer, Jonathan Sauder, designed HAR-V, a mechanical rover able to survive the inhospitable conditions on Venus where temperatures reach 460C. Here’s Jonathan talking to BBC World Service programme, Tech Life:"

For example, countries around the world use different electrical plugs which would be better to standardise – but imagine the work involved!

In terms of being able to type quickly, QWERTY isn’t the best - in fact, court reporters type much faster with alternative keyboards. Court reporters need to type fast to record cases verbatim, using exactly the same words that were originally spoken."

In fact, the UK’s first home computer was the Sinclair ZX80 which was released in 1980 and used a whopping 4 kilobyte memory, that’s about half an email! OK, it’s time to recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme starting with obsolete, meaning no longer in use, having been replaced by something newer or better."
