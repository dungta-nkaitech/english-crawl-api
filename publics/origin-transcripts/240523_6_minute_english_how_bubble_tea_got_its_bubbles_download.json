Here in Britain, new trends such as iced tea and green matcha tea have become as popular as the traditional English cuppa which, as everyone knows, is black tea with a splash of milk."

The ‘bubbles’ in a glass of bubble tea are made from balls of a chewy starch called tapioca. Food which is chewy needs to be chewed a lot before it becomes soft enough to swallow."

    "speaker": "innovative,",
    "text": "What’s more, because tapioca doesn’t have a strong taste, different flavours can be added, making bubble tea an innovative, meaning new and original, drink. Liu Han-Chieh’s invention was inspired by a trip to Japan where he saw people enjoying iced milk tea on a hot summer day. When he added tapioca balls, which he found in a local market on his return to Taiwan, the bubbly new beverage was born."
