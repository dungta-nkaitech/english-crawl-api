    "text": "In very practical terms, it had a very significant effect on what women wore in public. And when they first rode bicycles they were expected to ride in long ankle length skirts and voluminous petticoats and of course that was entirely impractical so they adopted what was called rational dress. And rational dress was a better fitting jacket and pantaloon trousers which were cinched below the knee, which meant that nothing got caught in the chain. And at first there was massive public outrage. There were court cases about whether or not women were allowed to be served in pubs wearing this sort of dress."

    "text": "But pantaloons for women still caused outrage – or shock and anger – because although they were baggy, they were still trousers and they didn't go down to the ankle. So bikes played a part in women's struggle for emancipation – or freedom. But let's listen now to Robert Penn, who claims that it also played a role in our evolutionary history."
