The original word ‘fan’ was first used about Americans in the early 20th century. But what were these Americans fans of? Was it:"

It taps into that ancient human impulse to belong to a group of like-minded people, and of course being a fan by yourself can be a challenging thing because fannish pursuits can look quirky and odd… even obsessive, and you get often mocked and, I mean, if you're Jane Austen fan and you want to dress up in a bonnet and gown of the Regency era it's difficult to do that by yourself in public, but once you join a fandom there's no problem."
