Kids were coming of age, becoming more like free and venturing out and around the estate. And, you know, police kind of, like. harassing, but..."

Because that’s such a raw tune, but the chorus literally chants like ‘there are lots of signs in life, some that you may not realise’. And, for me, I was listening to that as like an 11- or 12-year-old and it’s very existential."
