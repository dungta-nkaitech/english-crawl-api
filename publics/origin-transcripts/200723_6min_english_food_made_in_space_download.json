    "text": "Basically we use LED lighting and we use LED lights that are tuned to a specific wavelength. So, if you image what the rainbow looks like, the reason a plant looks green is because it’s not using all the green light – it actually reflects a lot of that back. So the reason why it looks pink in here is because we’re actually only using red light and blue light to grow the plants, and that essentially tailors the light diet so that the plants look black when you look at them because they’re not reflecting any light – they’re being super-efficient, they’re using up every photon that hits them."

    "speaker": "LED lights",

    "text": "Microgravity is really challenging but plants are amazing! They can adapt to so many different environments – we call this plasticity because they can turn on or off their genes  to really adapt to all sorts of conditions and that’s why you see plants growing in different areas on Earth - the same type of plant may look very different because it’s adapting to the environment in that specific location."
