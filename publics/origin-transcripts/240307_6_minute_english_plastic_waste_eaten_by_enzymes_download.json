According to the UN, around 400 million tonnes of new plastic is produced every year, much of it going to waste. It’s hard to imagine what 400 million tonnes looks like, so which of the following, if you placed on a set of scales, would weigh about the same? Is it:"

Some gets incinerated or burnt, and about half of all plastic waste goes straight to landfill, meaning it’s buried underground. But as reporter for BBC World Service programme, ‘People Fixing The World’, William Kremer, explained, this only fixes part of the problem:"

    "text": "So, there is a mechanical process where some plastics can be sort of melted down and remoulded into a new shape or a new form, but not all plastics can go through that process at all. And also, it loses a little bit of quality every time you do that, so it will become slightly more brittle. So, it's actually more downcycling than recycling - every time it goes through that process it gets less useful."

    "text": "The problem is that very few enzymes exist which can break the chemical bonds in stronger plastics like PET, the plastic used in drinks bottles. At least, that’s what scientists used to think, until researcher, Sintawee Sulaiman, took an autumn walk in the park near her laboratory at the University of Osaka, Japan. In a pile of rotting leaves, she discovered the microorganism, ‘leaf-branch compost cutinase’, or LCC for short."
