Menstruation, or periods, are a natural process that typically happen once a month when women and girls bleed from their vagina for a few days as part of the reproductive cycle. When this happens, women need special products like sanitary pads or tampons to manage the flow of blood and go about their day-to-day life."

    "text": "Unfortunately, over 500 million people around the world either don't have access to these products or can't afford to buy them, and this is called period poverty. Period poverty has serious consequences, for example, girls on their periods not going to school affects their education, and women who can’t work during their period have less income. What’s more, it can cause health problems because, without sanitary products, its easy to get infections."

And, of course, we’ll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well. But first, Georgie, I have a question for you. Periods affect girls and women of reproductive age, that’s roughly half the female population, or 26% of the global population. But how many people is that? Is it:"

Ella Lambert was a student at Bristol University when she started The Pachamama Project in 2020 during the first Covid lockdown. She’d heard about period poverty and decided to put her lockdown time to good use by making sanitary pads, pieces of soft material used to absorb menstrual blood. Here’s Ella explaining how her project got started to BBC World Service programme, ‘People Fixing the World’:"

In fact, Ella was so focused on sewing sanitary pads she didn’t make anything else, and to this day, pads are the only thing she knows how to sew. Ella uses the phrase, to this day, to say: up to and including the present moment."
