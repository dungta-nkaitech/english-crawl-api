Eventually, GSOH became a part of everyday English."

If you occasionally do it and you made it sound a bit more like you do it all the time, that’s more exaggeration – a lot of people do that, where they exaggerate things about themselves to make them seem more attractive. But they’re walking a fine line in trying to balance between being attractive and not completely disappointing."
