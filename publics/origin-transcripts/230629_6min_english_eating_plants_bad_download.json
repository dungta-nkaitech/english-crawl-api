That’s what we’ll be discussing in this programme, and as usual we'll be learning some new useful vocabulary as well."

The plants talked to each other, passing along information about water and air temperature through their roots, like children playing a game where a message is passed on, in a whisper, through a chain of people, becoming distorted in the process.
