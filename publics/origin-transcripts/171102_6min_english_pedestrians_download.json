One is space – because we’ve still got the same street structures in our towns and cities, causing congestion. It causes pollution, which people are concerned about more and more. And actually, it’s kind of engineering walking out of our lives. So we’re actually not getting enough exercise, which is a cause of a health crisis. Smart cities are looking at pedestrianisation – in Glasgow, in Birmingham, in London for example, Manchester – as a way of not only making their places, cities better and more attractive, actually, building their local economy."
