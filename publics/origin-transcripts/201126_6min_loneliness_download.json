    "text": "Well novels are fascinating, because there’s a difference between novels in the 18th Century, when they first came into being, and novels in the 19th Century - in the 18th Century something like Robinson Crusoe, there’s not a single reference to loneliness. By the 19th Century novels are full of lonely people and that reflects those kinds of social changes."

And so Victorian fiction in particular tends to be full of woman who are in search of the significant other and needing to find happiness and an absence of loneliness in the domestic."

    "order": 19,
    "speaker": "social change",
    "text": "It’s interesting that Fay mentions the story of Robinson Crusoe – about a man living on a desert island – does not mention the word loneliness. But because of a shift in how people behaved and thought in the 19th century – called social change – loneliness became an emotion that was written about in stories."

  {
    "order": 22,
    "speaker": "Neil",
    "text": "Even today, being alone gives us headspace and time to think, as long as it doesn’t last forever. Anyway, as we mentioned, we’ve probably all been lonely at some point, and Fay Bound Alberti told the Thinking Aloud programme that loneliness can take many forms."

    "speaker": "pinch pointschronic",
    "text": "Absolutely, I think that loneliness is something that affects all people but at different times in their lives. I would describe in terms of pinch points – there are times when we change [when we become] when we get married, we become mothers, we get divorced, anything that changes our life might put us under temporary loneliness. When it’s a problem is when it becomes chronic."

    "text": "It seems that there are certain times in our lives when we might feel lonely – when we break up with a partner or have a baby and feel isolated, for example. These are moments that Fay describes as pinch points – times in your life where there are difficulties and things slow down or change."

    "order": 25,
    "speaker": "chronic",

  },
  {
    "order": 26,
    "speaker": "Neil",
    "text": "And loneliness isn’t always obvious to other people, so it’s good to check in with friends and family to see how they’re feeling and to ask if they’re OK. Of course, it would be difficult to check in on Mauro Morandi, who’s been living on Budelli Island in Italy for many years, but how many years exactly?"

He told National Geographic magazine “I’m sort of in prison here… but it’s a prison that I chose for myself.” So I’m guessing he’s got used to his own company! I certainly couldn’t live alone for that long – I’d been too lonely, I need company Rob."
