When you're on the telephone to someone, especially if you're British – you know, that Bernard Shaw thing – oh, you know, the moment one Englishman opens his mouth another Englishman despises him - when you're speaking to someone on the telephone all the age, class, education, vocabulary all come into play because it's in real time and it's embarrassing. I hate being on the telephone to people - especially strangers in shops and things like that because it's embarrassing and awkward."
