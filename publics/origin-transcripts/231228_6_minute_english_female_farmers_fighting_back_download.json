According to the United Nations, over 40% of farmers globally are women, a number which rises to almost 50% in lower and middle-income countries. Although these women manage farms, look after crops, and sell their produce at market, female farmers face sexism in societies where women are expected to raise children and stay at home."

And while the three cents extra might sound small, over the course of the year, as prices fluctuate the WFP say the average monthly revenue for each farmer using the app has risen dramatically. In the long run, the hope is that it will also be possible to challenge and change attitudes around gender, but in the meantime the extra money she makes per sale makes a big difference to Poppy and her family."
