But unfortunately, most comfort food is high in carbohydrates and sugar and, after a few minutes, it leaves us feeling even worse than before."

People who link what we eat with how we feel make a simple argument: the food you eat supplies nutrients and energy to the brain, and the brain controls our emotions. Now, that might sound simplistic, but the brain is a vital link in the connection between food and our mood. So, Sam, my question is: how much of the body’s total energy is used up by the brain? Is it:"

    "text": "Right. Well, I’ll reveal the answer later in the programme. Emotional eating is often caused by feelings of depression, anxiety or stress. Chef Danny Edwards, who has suffered with depression, works in one of the most stressful places imaginable - a busy restaurant kitchen. BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, asked Danny about his eating habits at work:"

    "speaker": "appetitegrabbingon the go",
    "text": "Actually, when you’re working in a kitchen environment for long periods, your appetite can become suppressed because you sometimes don't want to eat, or you don't feel like you can stop and eat, and all of that. So, it very often is grabbing something on the go which obviously, as we know, is not great for us… So you go for something that’s quick, so hence why a lot of chefs have quite a bad diet."

    "speaker": "appetitegrab and go",
    "text": "Even though he’s surrounded by food, Danny says that working under stress actually decreases his appetite – the feeling that you want to eat food. In a busy kitchen there’s no time for a sit-down meal, so Danny has to grab and go – take something quickly because he doesn’t have much time, although he knows this isn’t very healthy."

She studied the effect of eating a healthy diet – food such as fresh fruit and vegetables, wholegrain cereals, and olive oil – on people suffering depression. Professor Jacka found that the patients whose mental health improved were the same patients who had also improved their diet."
