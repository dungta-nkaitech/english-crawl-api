She’s written a book, helpfully called ‘Can You Die From A Broken Heart?’ She was a guest on the BBC Radio 4 programme Woman’s Hour and was asked that very question. Does she think it is possible?"

For most of us when we have a broken heart whether it’s bereavement or a relationship coming to an end we will be fine. We’ll muddle our way through it, we’ll take not so good care of ourselves but we’ll get there. However the physical effects still happen and it is a big stress on your emotions obviously but also on your body."

This expression means that we get through our sadness. Maybe slowly and maybe we don’t think clearly and don’t make the right decisions – but in the end, we mend our broken hearts."

    "speaker": "Neil",
