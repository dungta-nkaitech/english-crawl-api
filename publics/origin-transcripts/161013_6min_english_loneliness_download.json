And loneliness is sometimes described as a social pain – a pain that tells us that we're isolated – or lacking contact with others – which motivates us to seek out companionship."

    "speaker": "Sophie",
    "text": "OK, we'll see if you got that right later on in the show. So, getting back to loneliness – the idea is that because it makes us feel bad, it motivates us to go out and meet people. Some people are more likely to feel lonely than others because our genes play a role in this tendency."

Let's listen to Professor Dorret Boomsma at the Vrije University in Amsterdam talking about this."

    "speaker": "Professor Dorret Boomsma, Department of Biological Psychology at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam",
    "text": "So the intriguing question is why do genes that influence loneliness still exist? And one explanation is that probably they do not only have negative effects. In some situations it is an advantage to be able to tolerate high levels of loneliness and that is why the genes are maintained in the population."

    "order": 20,
    "speaker": "Sophie",

    "order": 23,
    "speaker": "Neil",
    "text": "That's true. And actually, that was despite spending a long time on Facebook, and that's a form of social contact. But does all the tweeting, messaging, and chatting online that we do make us lonelier, because we're getting out less and meeting fewer people? Or do virtual connections stop us from feeling lonely?"
  },
  {
    "order": 24,
    "speaker": "Sophie",
    "text": "Those are also intriguing questions. Let's listen to Professor Eric Klinenberg sociologist at New York University and author of a book about living alone. He talks about this."

    "text": "We just don't have great research showing that we are significantly more lonely or isolated today than we were ten or twenty or thirty years ago, which means critics who say that Facebook or the internet or whatever device you carry with you, is making you lonelier and more miserable - they just don't have that much evidence to back it up."

  {

    "speaker": "Sophie",
    "text": "Yes. There are environmental factors involved in loneliness too. For example, if somebody you talk to every day is always unfriendly towards you, this makes you statistically more likely to be negative in your interactions with somebody else."

Living alone in Sweden is arguably the norm because it's so easy – there are many affordable single-occupancy apartments and young Swedes can expect to move into their own apartment once they graduate high-school."
