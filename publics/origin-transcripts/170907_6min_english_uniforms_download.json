In Germany they call it ‘maskenfreiheit’, which is the freedom conferred by masks. There’s something about taking on what is very clearly a persona or professional role, that can be liberating, I think."

    "speaker": "Neil",
    "text": "Maybe. If you’re shy, for example, a uniform might feel liberating because it allows you to behave more confidently. So, if you could choose a uniform and a new persona, what would it be, Tim?"
