So, according to the group’s website, what is the most popular food foraged in the UK? Is it:"

The idea is that natural unprocessed foods found in the wild support our microbiome, leading to a range of health benefits from weight loss to increased energy levels. The foragers’ microbiome is measured and monitored before, during and after the experiment. Here’s Mo Wilde chatting with one of the foragers, Rob Gould, for BBC Radio 4’s, The Food Programme."
