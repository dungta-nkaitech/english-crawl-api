One of them is called ‘jaali’, but what exactly is it? Is ‘jaali’:"

Roshni Diwakar is a consultant for the Mahila Housing Trust, an NGO helping poor Indian women to heat-proof their houses. These women often work from home while their husbands are out in the heat working on construction sites. Here Roshni describes a typical house to BBC World Service programme, People Fixing The World:"

Painting reflective anti-solar white paint on the roof can reduce room temperatures by up to 4 degrees. It may not sound like much, but it makes a big difference and allows families to work, cook, and even sleep inside.
