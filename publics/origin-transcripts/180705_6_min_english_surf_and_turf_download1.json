Surf and turf refers to when we go to an online store, select lots of things for our virtual shopping basket but when we get to the checkout, which is the place where we pay for our shopping, we don't actually complete the purchase. We turf out the basket. We abandon it."

    "order": 22,
    "speaker": "Neil",

You might also make a basket in one online store, then go to another to see if you can get the same or similar items cheaper there. So I agree: I don't think that the figure of 18 billion represents a total. Some of that was never intended to be spent – and some would have gone to other stores."

You spend time collecting all the things in the basket, then find you have to create an account, or you can't use your favourite payment method, or have to pay more to use a credit card and you have to fill out so many details. Sometimes you get so frustrated that you just give up."
