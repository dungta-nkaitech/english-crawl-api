Forget traditional carrots, leeks and potatoes - vegetables today are getting a modern makeover thanks to breeding methods which mix two different plants to produce something completely new, known as a hybrid."

In this programme, we’ll hear all about these new vegetables and the people who grow, cook and eat them. And, as usual, we’ll be learning some new vocabulary as well."
