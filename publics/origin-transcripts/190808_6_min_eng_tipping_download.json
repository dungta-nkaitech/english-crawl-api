Now as we hear him, listen out for this information: in how many cities does he say he currently has restaurants?"

Before he talks about how the policies differ, he says i.e. These two letters stand for the Latin phrase 'id est'. Now we never say 'id est' but we do write and say i.e. We use it to show that what comes next is using different words to say what we have just said or written. So he says, about tipping, it's cultural i.e. it differs from place to place. 'It's cultural' is a more general statement and 'it differs from place to place' is a more specific definition of what he means."
