The footage is known as the Tic Tac videos, and they have had millions of views on YouTube. Now, these videos are being reviewed by US Congress to try understand what these objects were."

They're saying they behaved in ways that no jet could behave. But you know, again, personal testimony. You can't do any science with that. So, what may happen now is we're gonna begin to get us some scientific study of this and we'll try and get a better handle on it."

Extra-terrestrial means from outside, Earth, and is another word often used to describe aliens. So, it seems that, for now, scientists will need to find much more proof to know exactly whether we are alone in the universe or not."
