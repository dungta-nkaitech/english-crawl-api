A software engineer called, Blake Lemoine, was working on the artificial intelligence project, ‘Language Models for Dialogue Applications’, or LaMDA for short. LaMDA is a chatbot – a computer programme designed to have conversations with humans over the internet."

But what happens at the end of the movie? Is it:"

Although Hollywood is full of movies about robots coming to life, Emily Bender, professor of linguistics and computing at the University of Washington, thinks AI isn’t that smart. She thinks the words we use to talk about technology, phrases like ‘machine learning’, give a false impression about what computers can and can’t do."

Artificial intelligence works by finding patterns in massive amounts of data, so it can seem like we’re talking with a human, instead of a machine doing data analysis.
