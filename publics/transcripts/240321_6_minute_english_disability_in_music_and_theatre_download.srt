00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,519
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English.

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:12,519
I'm Neil.

4
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:13,839
And I'm Georgie.

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,839
Many people love watching movies at the cinema or going to the theatre to see a play.

6
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:23,400
But have you ever imagined what an art gallery would be like if you were blind?

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,879
Or how a deaf person might feel at a music concert?

8
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:33,560
In the UK, the Equality Act of 2010 guaranteed the rights of disabled people to equal access

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:39,679
to education, employment and services including music, theatre and the arts.

10
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:44,719
Since then, the Disability Rights Movement has worked hard to break down barriers for disabled

11
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,039
artists and performers and their audiences.

12
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:53,640
In this programme, we'll be hearing from a musical composer whose work using new instruments

13
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,719
allows disabled musicians to express their lived experience through music.

14
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,280
The phrase lived experience emphasises the unique experience of disabled people, plus the

15
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,120
fact that this gives them knowledge and understanding that others do not have.

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,920
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

17
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,319
Great, but first I have a question for you, Georgie.

18
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:22,400
Despite 2010's Equality Act, it's still difficult for disabled musicians and music fans in the

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,880
UK to perform and see live music.

20
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,280
A study by disabled musicians group Attitude is everything found that one-third of music

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,080
venues provided no disabled access information at all.

22
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,920
But which London music venue was recently given a gold award for accessibility for disabled

23
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,120
musicians and audiences?

24
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:50,040
Was it A, the Royal Albert Hall, B, the South Bank Centre or C, Brixton Academy?

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,880
I'll guess it was the Royal Albert Hall.

26
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,800
OK, Georgie, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

27
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,480
Megan Steinberg is a music composer at Royal Northern College of Music, where she

28
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:08,400
collaborates with Drake Music, a leading national organisation working in music, disability

29
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,879
and technology.

30
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:13,879
Megan composes music to be played by new instruments.

31
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:21,159
Here she explains what a new instrument is to BBC Radio 3 programme, art and ideas.

32
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:26,639
So they may have been mass produced or semi-mass produced or they may have been designed and built

33
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:33,519
by the musicians themselves as like a bespoke instrument for themselves and they're designed

34
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:40,519
to be accessible to maybe just that one individual form or maybe also to lots of different

35
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:43,560
performers with disabilities or differences.

36
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,080
Megan's new instruments are designed to be accessible to be used by someone with a disability.

37
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,560
More generally, the word accessible means enabling someone with a disability the opportunity

38
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:03,000
to engage in the same interactions and enjoy the same experiences as people without a disability.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,400
New instruments are both electronic and acoustic.

40
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,120
They might be mass produced, that's when a factory makes a lot of the same thing or bespoke,

41
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,240
made specially for one person in particular.

42
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,560
So what are these new instruments like?

43
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,840
Listen as Megan introduces the Rainbow Harp, a new instrument which was designed for Harpist,

44
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,280
Morewenna Lutit Vermaert to BBC Radio programme, art and ideas.

45
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:38,480
And the Rainbow Harp is a harp that has colour-coded strings and each string colour corresponds

46
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,480
to a different pitch.

47
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:47,560
So Morewenna is dyslexic and she really found that traditional black and white musical notation

48
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,159
was quite an obstacle for her in learning and teaching music.

49
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:57,560
So she and her husband made these harps and they're really colourful and she uses colour

50
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,319
in music.

51
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:05,159
Morewenna is dyslexic, she has dyslexia, a condition which makes it difficult for her to spell,

52
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,879
read and write.

53
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,519
So when Morewenna's harp teacher wanted her to play from written down sheet music, her

54
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,240
brain froze.

55
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,480
And that's how the Rainbow Harp was invented.

56
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,680
The strings of a Rainbow Harp are colour-coded.

57
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,120
Different colours are used to represent and separate out different strings and to produce

58
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
different notes.

59
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,920
It's a great idea and an inclusive way for disabled musicians to share their talent with music

60
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,920
fans across the UK.

61
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,399
Which reminds me of my question Georgie.

62
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:42,479
Right, you asked me which London music venue was awarded top marks for making music accessible

63
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,159
for disabled musicians and audiences.

64
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:49,120
I guess it was the Royal Albert Hall, so was I right?

65
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,279
Good guess Georgie, but that was the wrong answer I'm afraid.

66
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:59,199
The good news for all music fans living in London is that the South Bank Centre is accessible,

67
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,199
ready and waiting.

68
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,279
OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt in this programme.

69
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,719
Starting with lived experience.

70
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:12,119
The things that someone has experienced personally for themselves rather than heard or read about.

71
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:17,799
If something is accessible, it enables everyone to have equal opportunities and experiences

72
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:19,919
regardless of their abilities.

73
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,000
To mass-produce something means to make many copies of it cheaply in a factory, whereas

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,159
a bespoke product has been made specially for one person in particular.

75
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:34,119
A dyslexic person has dyslexia, a condition making it difficult for them to spell

76
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,639
read or write.

77
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,840
And finally things which are colour coded use different colours to represent different parts

78
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,639
or functions.

79
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,319
Once again, our six minutes are up, but remember to join us again next time here at 6 Minute

80
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,319
English.

81
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,319
Goodbye for now.

82
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,319
Bye.
