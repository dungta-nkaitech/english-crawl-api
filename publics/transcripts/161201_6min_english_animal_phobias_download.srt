5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,800
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,719
And I'm Sophie. Neil, what are you afraid of?

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,800
I'm not keen on anything with wings, but I particularly hate moths.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,679
They're disgusting with their fat hairy bodies and flattery wings.

9
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:31,280
Oh, Neil, moths are completely harmless.

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,039
They aren't something to be scared of.

11
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:33,840
Yes, they are.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,679
They get in my face and my hair, it makes my flesh creep just thinking about them.

13
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:43,439
If something makes your flesh creep, it makes you feel very frightened.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,359
Well, I hope you're going to survive the show today, Neil, because it's all about animal fobias.

15
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,240
And a fobia is a strong and irrational fear.

16
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,960
That's a fear not based on reason.

17
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,640
Okay, I'll try. Do you have any animal fobias, Sophie?

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,799
I can't stand dogs.

19
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,320
Man's best friend.

20
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,799
How can you not like dogs? They're cute and lovable.

21
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,960
They protect you. They can do tricks.

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,719
Look, for you, it's moths, and that's pretty ridiculous, by the way.

23
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:12,240
And for me, it's dogs.

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,159
And that isn't ridiculous.

25
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,680
Dogs can be aggressive.

26
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,120
They have shark teeth.

27
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,599
They bear their teeth and bark.

28
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,719
What, like this?

29
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,759
Oh, yes.

30
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,479
And please turn that off. It's upsetting me.

31
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:33,919
It's time for today's quiz question.

32
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:38,879
Can you tell me, Neil, what's the word that describes an irrational fear of insects?

33
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:46,399
Is it A, e tomophobia, B, the natophobia, or C, begonophobia?

34
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,719
I'll say the natophobia.

35
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,399
Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right later on in the show.

36
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,359
But now, let's listen to Dr. Dean Burnett,

37
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,040
neuroscientist at Cardiff University in the UK,

38
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,000
talking about what causes phobic reactions in us.

39
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,120
The sensory information is just relayed directly into your brain.

40
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,439
One part of it is it's rooted into the cortex,

41
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,159
where it's sort of thought about. That's that thing.

42
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,040
I know that from the last of experience this.

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,560
And you can rationalize your way through it.

44
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,000
But it also sends a message directly to the amygdala,

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,280
which immediately triggers the fight-to-flight response.

46
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,560
Bang, viral arm, off it goes, flood the body, just in case.

47
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,000
It's a survival mechanism.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,360
Dr. Dean Burnett there.

49
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,520
So the sensory information, for me, is a moth fluttering around,

50
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,879
getting in my hair.

51
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,879
That's right. Or for me, it's a dog getting anywhere near me.

52
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:47,439
Anyway, this information goes into our brains and is processed in two different parts of the brain.

53
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,319
The central cortex and the amygdala.

54
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,239
And the information sent to the central cortex triggers a rational response,

55
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,799
like, oh, it's only a harmless moth.

56
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:00,639
And the stuff that goes to the amygdala triggers an instinctive reaction.

57
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,519
The fight-or-flight response. Like, ah!

58
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,079
It's a disgusting moth. Get away from me!

59
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:10,879
The fight-or-flight response is a normal response to stress or danger,

60
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,039
and it involves the hormone adrenaline being pumped quickly around the body.

61
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,240
The problem is, this response can get triggered where there isn't any danger.

62
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,519
And this is at the heart of whatophobia is.

63
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,039
So that's the moth flying in my face while I'm reading in bed,

64
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,400
and I feel my heart beating so fast, I think I'm going to pass out and I nearly die from anxiety.

65
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,280
Poor Neil.

66
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,359
Pass out means to faint or lose consciousness, by the way.

67
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,359
Well, we're going to hear from Stephen and Reena now,

68
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:43,919
two self-confessed arachnophobes.

69
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,280
They have strong emotional reactions just like you, Neil.

70
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:50,159
Can you identify which animal they fear?

71
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,520
So when I see a spider, I feel like I've been punched in the chest.

72
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,960
Complete fear. It's absolutely paralyzing.

73
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,159
They've never been okay with me. I've always hated them.

74
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,159
I spent a lot of time driving around the car afraid to go home.

75
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,080
Well, my husband, Rector London.

76
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,479
All rationality goes out the window and my emotions completely take over.

77
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:13,439
I just, I just run.

78
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,480
So arachnophobes have a strong fear of spiders,

79
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,759
and it's the most common animal phobia apparently.

80
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,399
You could understand that if you're living in Australia,

81
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:26,639
where a bite from a spider might kill you,

82
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,639
but the little spiders you get here in the UK don't seem threatening at all.

83
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,480
Yes, but recent research has shown that we have a reflexive awareness of spiders,

84
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:42,319
whether we fear them or not, which means we can spot them automatically without thinking about it.

85
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:48,480
And we don't have the same reflexive awareness of houseflies or moths, for example.

86
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,120
I expect this awareness is to do with our ancestors.

87
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,480
It would have been extremely useful to spot a spider as an early human on the plains of the African

88
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,039
savannah. A bite might kill you or make you vulnerable to attack from other animals.

89
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,079
You're right, Neil. But do you think you were right about today's quiz question?

90
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:11,360
I asked, what's the word that describes an irrational fear of insects?

91
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Is it A, it's homophobia?

92
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
B, it's the natophobia?

93
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
Or C, it's the natophobia?

94
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,680
I said it's the natophobia.

95
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,080
That's the wrong answer.

96
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,199
It's actually A, it's the natophobia.

97
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,280
It's also known as insectophobia.

98
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:37,360
It's a specific phobia characterized by an excessive or unrealistic fear of one or more classes of insect.

99
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,680
The natophobia is the fear of death and pegonophobia is the fear of beards or beaded people.

100
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,280
Well, moths are kind of hairy.

101
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,879
Let's remind ourselves of some of the words we heard today.

102
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,879
Make your flesh creep.

103
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,160
Fobia.

104
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:53,920
Irrational.

105
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,480
Fight or flight response.

106
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,240
Pass out.

107
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,319
A racne of foes.

108
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,639
Reflexive awareness.

109
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,319
And that's the end of today's six minute English.

110
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,800
Don't forget to join us again soon.

111
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,439
Goodbye.

112
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,079
Bye bye.
