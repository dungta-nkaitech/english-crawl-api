00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,120
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,000
And I'm Neil.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,199
So Neil, you texted me earlier and didn't put a full stop at the end.

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,600
You're right. I never use full stops in text.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,839
They're much too stuffy or formal.

9
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,039
Texting is like conversation. You don't need lots of punctuation.

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,399
Well, punctuation is the subject of today's show.

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,960
And I know I'm a bit of a stickler about this,

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,719
but I think you're letting the standards of written English language slip.

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,200
A stickler is someone who insists on a certain way of doing a particular thing.

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,079
Surely you aren't such a stickler for punctuation rules

15
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,879
that you want to stop the evolution of English, Alice?

16
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,399
No, of course not, but I am a stickler when people don't follow the rules of punctuation.

17
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,159
Because this makes written text ambiguous or difficult to understand.

18
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,399
And ambiguous means when something has two or more meanings.

19
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,719
Can you give me some examples of punctuation making text easier to understand?

20
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,679
All right, then. Here you are. Let's eat grandma.

21
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:13,840
Yeah. It brings to mind the children's story, little red riding hood,

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,640
about a girl, her grandmother, and a hungry wolf.

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,159
Is that the wolf talking to another wolf friend of his?

24
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,199
No, it's the girl red riding hood talking to her grandmother.

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,840
And with a well-placed comma, it becomes...

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,480
Let's eat grandma.

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,040
Without proper punctuation, the sentence is ambiguous.

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,040
Now, before we look at more reasons why punctuation is important,

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,879
let's have today's quiz question.

30
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:46,879
Okay, what is another word for the keyboard sign that represents a paragraph?

31
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:52,480
Is it a, pill-crow, b, bodkin, or c, piker?

32
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,040
I'll say c, piker.

33
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,320
Well, we will find out later in the show if you got that right or wrong.

34
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,520
Mm, moving on now, punctuation was invented by the ancient Greeks.

35
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,640
They used a series of dots to indicate different lengths of pauses.

36
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,960
A short unit of text was a comma, a longer unit was a colon,

37
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,759
and a complete sentence was a periodus.

38
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,120
We used these terms to name our punctuation marks,

39
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,200
although they actually refer to the clauses not to the dots themselves.

40
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,240
So early punctuation wasn't really about grammar then?

41
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,800
No, it was about public speaking.

42
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,080
The different dots indicated different lengths of pauses,

43
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,240
short, medium, and long.

44
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,680
These pauses broke up the text, so it was easier to read and therefore easier to understand.

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,680
Okay, let's hear from the punctuation expert Keith Houston,

46
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,560
who is author of shady characters,

47
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,360
ampersands, interabangs, and other type of graphical curiosities.

48
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,680
Here he's talking on BBC Radio 4's Word of Mouth.

49
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,640
Punctuation started off being all about rhetoric, about speech,

50
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,920
but we started to assign rules.

51
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,159
I think around about the eighth century or so,

52
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,680
we started to associate the marks, not just with pauses,

53
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,879
but with the actual grammatical units they were used to punctuate.

54
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,280
So a comma wasn't just a dot that meant pauses for this length of time.

55
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,000
It now actually marked out a clause,

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,719
you know, it marked out a sort of consistent logical bit of writing.

57
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:32,800
So rhetoric or the art of persuasive speaking was very important to the Greeks and to the Romans,

58
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,919
and to be persuasive you need to be understood.

59
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,639
And these little punctuation marks helped the speaker to deliver their text more effectively.

60
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,839
Later on, these marks were given grammatical functions.

61
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:49,199
The comma marks out a clause or grammatical unit containing a subject and a verb,

62
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,519
as well as telling the reader to pause briefly.

63
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:58,159
Are you beginning to see why being sloppy or careless with punctuation isn't a good thing, Neil?

64
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,199
Yes, I am.

65
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,079
Though recent research into texting and punctuation suggests that people consider messages

66
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,839
ending in full stops to be less sincere than ones without.

67
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,000
Really? Well, now might be a good time to hear about how it can be hard to make writing unambiguous.

68
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,800
We can misinterpret the written word even with punctuation to guide us.

69
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,560
Here's Keith Houston again talking to Michael Rosen, presenter of Word of Mouth.

70
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,840
Quite often I notice on Twitter and places like that people misunderstand irony,

71
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,680
I mean, because we only have text in front of us, not intonation.

72
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,720
So do we need an irony punctuation?

73
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,200
Hello, I'm being ironic now. Do we need that?

74
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,280
You might say that emoticons are the best way to go about that,

75
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,840
a little winking emoticon, you know, semi-colon, dash, closing parentheses.

76
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,240
Oh, yes. Of course, they've invented all these,

77
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,880
using the punctuation that we have on the keyboard.

78
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,600
irony means using words to mean something that is the opposite of its literal or most usual meaning.

79
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,720
But when we're online using email or Twitter, you don't hear the words and that's why it can be

80
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,680
hard to know what feelings the writer intended.

81
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,040
Mmm, that's right.

82
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,840
When we use emoticons facial expressions made out of keyboard characters,

83
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,880
we can signpost the feelings we intend.

84
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,080
Now, Alice, remember I asked you, what is another word for the keyboard sign that represents a

85
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,160
paragraph? Is it A, Pilcro, B, Bodkin or C, Pica?

86
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,240
Yes, I said Pica.

87
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,880
And you were wrong, I'm afraid.

88
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,480
The right answer is Pilcro, which comes from the Greek word Paragraphos.

89
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:43,680
The earliest reference of the modern Pilcro is from 1440 with the middle English word

90
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,959
pilecraft.

91
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,759
Oh, dear, sad face.

92
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,560
I hate it when I get the quiz question wrong.

93
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,480
Now, can we hear the words we learnt today?

94
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,680
Yes, they are.

95
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,240
Stuffy.

96
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,680
Stickler.

97
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,120
Retric.

98
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:58,560
Claws.

99
00:05:59,439 --> 00:05:59,920
Slumpy.

100
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,439
Irony.

101
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:02,959
Literal.

102
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,480
Emoticons.

103
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,600
Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
