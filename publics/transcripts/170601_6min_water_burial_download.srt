00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,880
From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,960
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English,

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,720
the show that brings you an interesting topic,

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,480
authentic listening practice, and six new items of vocabulary.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,120
I'm Dan.

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,080
And I'm Neil.

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,359
In this episode, we'll be discussing water burial.

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,480
Yes, it's a bit of a bleak subject, I'm afraid.

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,679
Something which is bleak is unpleasant or without hope.

13
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:31,519
And you know what's really bleak?

14
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,280
It's this week's question.

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,960
On average, how many people die each hour?

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,880
Is it a, 6,000, b, 60,000, or c, 600,000?

17
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,280
Mmm, I am going to guess b, 60,000.

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,719
And we'll find out if you're right or not at the end of the show.

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,439
So the actual figure is 55 million people each year.

20
00:00:55,519 --> 00:01:00,239
Now, religious or not, there is a practical issue to be dealt with,

21
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,439
which is Neil?

22
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:03,119
What to do with the body?

23
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:04,480
Exactly.

24
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,719
So what are the options for the average person?

25
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,599
Well, there's burial or there's cremation.

26
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,759
Beryl is when a body is put into the earth

27
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:14,560
and cremation is when a body is burnt,

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,959
but there are big problems with both.

29
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,000
For example, what two things do most people need

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,599
in order to be buried?

31
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,879
Well, a coffin, or box to put the body in,

32
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,719
and a grave, that's the place the coffin and body go into.

33
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,079
Exactly, but coffins are most often made of wood.

34
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,479
In the US, they use four million acres of forest every year

35
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,079
just to make coffins.

36
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,840
And as for graves, cemetery is a beginning to get overcrowded.

37
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,039
There's no space left.

38
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:46,159
After all, dying is not exactly a new thing.

39
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,000
It's been happening for years.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,840
Aha, but with cremation, there's no space needed.

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,919
And they burn gas to dispose of the body.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,280
That's got to be better.

43
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,519
You'd think so, but no.

44
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,079
Ah, let's Sahaz Zand, reported for the BBC, explain why.

45
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,320
During the process, a number of toxins

46
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,480
can be emitted into our environment,

47
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,199
including mercury from dental fillings.

48
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,080
Cremecian also has a carbon cost.

49
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,240
With the energy used to process one body,

50
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,319
you could actually hit a home for the best part of a week in winter.

51
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,480
So cremation can release toxins or poisons into the environment,

52
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,799
and it comes with a very high energy cost,

53
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:26,639
enough to heat home for almost a week.

54
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,639
Okay, I can see a smug look in your eye, Dan.

55
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,319
What do you have up your sleeve?

56
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,519
It's the latest thing.

57
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,679
Water burial.

58
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:36,479
Water burial.

59
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,319
This is where the body is put into an alkalized solution

60
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,759
and heated to 150 degrees centigrade.

61
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,120
This breaks down the tissue and leaves only the skeleton.

62
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,399
Hmm, interesting.

63
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:51,519
Yes, and it has huge advantages over cremation.

64
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,159
Such as?

65
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,200
Well, for one thing, it takes only four hours to finish.

66
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,840
It follows the same process as when a body decomposes, but quicker.

67
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,520
When something decomposes, it breaks down into case.

68
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,480
Okay, anything else?

69
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,120
It uses much less energy.

70
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,240
Each body is weighed, and then the computer calculates exactly how much of everything is needed.

71
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,920
Okay, it's more efficient, too.

72
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,920
Why are you smiling?

73
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,360
This is the best part.

74
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,960
Listen to Sahaz again.

75
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,400
All that's left at this point is the brittle skeleton

76
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,600
and any artificial implants that they may have had in their body

77
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,640
and they come out almost as good as new.

78
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,400
There is even talk of sending their implants to the developing world

79
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,600
where they can benefit populations that don't have access to them,

80
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,200
because they're very expensive.

81
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,600
So, after the process, you have a brittle or easy-to-break skeleton

82
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,400
and any implants that they had inside them.

83
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,600
Implants are artificial additions to the body,

84
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,519
such as plastic hips or an artificial heart, and they're clean.

85
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,400
They can be recycled and given to someone who needs them.

86
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,359
Isn't that cool?

87
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,599
So, what happens to the skeleton?

88
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,519
It gets ground up into dust and put in a jar to give to the family.

89
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,919
Exactly the same as a traditional cremation.

90
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:04,799
I love it.

91
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,000
Sign me up.

92
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,359
Would you like to give it a shot?

93
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:10,319
Hmm, well, I can't answer that question.

94
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,439
But can I have the answer to our quiz question?

95
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,400
Of course.

96
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,560
I asked, on average, how many people die each hour?

97
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,879
A6000, B6000 or C600000.

98
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:24,480
I said B6000.

99
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,120
And you, my friend, are dead in the water.

100
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,920
Unfortunately, it's A6000.

101
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,840
Okay, well, that's probably better, isn't it?

102
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,480
Yes.

103
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,319
Should we have a look at the vocabulary then?

104
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,360
Certainly.

105
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
Our first word was bleak,

106
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,720
meaning something unhappy, unpleasant, or without hope.

107
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,600
What types of things do we typically describe as bleak, Neil?

108
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,120
Oh, the weather in the UK can be bleak.

109
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,240
It's very, very dark in the winter.

110
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,680
Next, we had grave.

111
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,040
A grave is a hole in the earth where a body is placed.

112
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,720
However, there is another use.

113
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,240
Yes, we can talk about a situation being grave.

114
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,600
The outbreak of war is a very grave situation for many people.

115
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,480
Then we had toxin.

116
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,360
A toxin is a substance which is poisonous.

117
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,760
Have you ever been poisoned by a toxin, Neil?

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,959
Well, I suppose so.

119
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,800
Yes, I've had food poisoning and that's caused by toxin.

120
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:19,439
After that was decompose.

121
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,439
When something decomposes, it breaks down into case,

122
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,599
much like when fruit goes bad and turns black and then becomes liquid.

123
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:27,920
There.

124
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,000
Then we had brittle.

125
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,639
Something which is brittle is easily broken, for example, Neil.

126
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,360
Glass, crockery tiles, and some plastic.

127
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,960
Crisps.

128
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,360
Finally, we had implant.

129
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,520
An implant is something artificial which has been put into the body,

130
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,480
such as an artificial heart or a replacement hip.

131
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,319
Would you like to have any implants then?

132
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,759
I'd quite like robotic legs.

133
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,840
Then I could run faster than anyone.

134
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
Well, we've run out of time.

135
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,759
So that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
