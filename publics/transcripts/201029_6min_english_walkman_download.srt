Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,559
And I'm Georgina.

7
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,480
Hello Georgina. How are you today?

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:21,920
Georgina?

9
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:23,760
Georgina?

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,120
Oh sorry, Neil. I didn't hear you. I was listening to music on my headphones.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,520
I see. Listening to music stored on your mobile phone or iPod

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,719
went out on the move doesn't seem like a big deal now.

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,079
But the concepts of personal portable music didn't exist until 1979,

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,640
when the Japanese electronics company Sony launched The Walkman.

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:54,159
Years before iPods and MP3 downloads, the Sony Walkman was the first widely available portable music player.

16
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,000
It revolutionised the way fans listened to their favourite bands.

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,520
In this programme, we'll be taking a nostalgic look back at the 1980s and the birth of the

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,920
Sony Walkman. And of course, we'll be learning some new vocabulary as well.

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,599
Now, it may not seem so revolutionary to young people nowadays,

20
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,480
but back in the late 1970s, portable music players were unheard of.

21
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,280
The idea behind the Walkman was simple. A high quality stereo cassette player,

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,280
small enough to hold in your hand, allowing you to walk down the street listening to your own soundtrack.

23
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,040
They became so popular that by the time production of The Walkman ended in 2010,

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,680
Sony had sold over 220 million machines worldwide.

25
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,120
So, my quiz question is this. When the original Walkman model first went on sale in 1979,

26
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:54,000
how much did it cost? Was it A, $50? B, $100 or C, $150?

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,959
Things were a lot cheaper in 1979 now, so I'll say B, $100.

28
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,079
Okay, Georgina will find out later if that's right.

29
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,359
Now, the inspiration behind the Walkman came from Sony Chairman Akeo Morita.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,680
He saw Japanese teenagers listening to heavy transistor radios carried on their shoulders

31
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,240
and had a vision of a smaller stereo which could be held in the hand.

32
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,520
However, few of Mr. Morita's colleagues had faith in his idea for a portable music player.

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:31,280
Here's Andrea Coppen of Sony UK, speaking to the BBC in 1989, taken from the BBC World Service

34
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,439
Programme Witness History. People were very skeptical. They couldn't believe that people would

35
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,640
want to walk around with headphones on and sort of carry this cassette with them.

36
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,760
And he actually laid his job on the line and said if it doesn't take off, I will resign.

37
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,480
And they didn't have much money at the time, so their advertising was very tight.

38
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:56,319
And they decided to give it to students to try.

39
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,079
And so people saw them on the trains in campuses in Taz and the newspapers picked up on it immediately.

40
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,639
The Walkman was designed to be used with headphones, a pair of padded speakers worn over the ears

41
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,759
so you can listen to music without other people hearing.

42
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,639
Akeo Morita was confident hysteria plus headphones idea would take off.

43
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:20,159
Suddenly start to be successful and popular.

44
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,719
In fact, he was so confident of success that he laid his job on the line,

45
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:30,159
an idiom meaning to risk losing something important, such as your job or reputation.

46
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,639
Luckily he didn't lose his job because many people started buying the new Walkmans.

47
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,840
Something the newspapers picked up on noticed or gave particular attention to.

48
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,359
Morita's idea was a massive success, released at the start of the summer holidays for Japanese

49
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:51,280
students. Within three months the entire first run of 30,000 Walkmans had sold out.

50
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,560
Meanwhile, music lovers outside of Japan were desperately trying to get hold of the new machines.

51
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,240
Among the first to buy one was music journalist Tim Jarman.

52
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,200
Here he is speaking to Farana Heider for BBC World Services Witness History.

53
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:13,760
It was made available in the US in June 1980. The Walkman was especially popular with a 16-24-age group.

54
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,759
They thought it could be a niche product that might not sell, but really caught the public's

55
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,279
imagination in every market that it was offered in. When the Walkman was sold to the rest of the world

56
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,439
and became popular with youngsters, people thought it was a niche product.

57
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,719
Something marketed for sale to a small specific group.

58
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:36,159
But instead, people of all ages began wearing Walkmans to listen to their favourite music on the move.

59
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:39,759
And the new invention caught the public imagination.

60
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,560
An idiom meaning made the public interested in or excited about something.

61
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,599
Many put the Walkman success down to its perfect combination of sound quality,

62
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:52,399
small size and affordable price.

63
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,319
But exactly how affordable Georgina remember my quiz question?

64
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:02,480
Yes Neil, you asked how much the original Walkman cost when it came out in 1979.

65
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,599
What did you say?

66
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:06,079
I thought it cost B$100.

67
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,199
Well Georgina things were cheaper in 1979, but not that cheap.

68
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,560
The actual price was C$150.

69
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,439
That's around $530 today.

70
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,839
In this programme we've been looking back at the iconic Sony Walkman.

71
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,319
The first portable stereo made up of a cassette player plus headphones,

72
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,120
pairs of padded speakers worn over the ears.

73
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,079
Sony Chairman Ekiyomarita was so confident his invention would take off,

74
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,079
become popular and successful that he laid his job on the line.

75
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,000
That means wrist something important like his job.

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,919
His colleagues at Sony worried the Walkman was a niche product,

77
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,120
product targeted for sale to a niche or small and specific market.

78
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,599
But luckily for him the Japanese newspapers picked up on his idea,

79
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:58,560
noticed it and gave it particular attention.

80
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,639
As a result the Sony Walkman caught the public imagination,

81
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:05,680
made the public excited and interested in it.

82
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,959
That's all for this programme until we meet again at 6 Minute English.

83
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,919
Happy Listening!

84
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,959
Happy Listening!
