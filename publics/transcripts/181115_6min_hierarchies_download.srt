00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,759
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,960
And I'm Catherine.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,640
Catherine, what's the connection between hierarchies, managers and chickens?

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,440
Well, I don't know Neil but I'm sure you're going to tell me.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,120
First of all, could you explain for our listeners what a hierarchy is?

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,200
Of course, a hierarchy is a way of organising people.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,520
For example, in a company where there are people working at different levels,

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,799
you've got bosses, managers and workers.

13
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:46,560
The workers do the work and the managers have meetings that stop the workers doing the work.

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,640
But where do the chickens come in?

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,920
We'll find out shortly but first here is today's question.

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,480
And it is, surprise, surprise about chickens.

17
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,759
What is the record number of eggs laid by one chicken in a year?

18
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:07,840
Is it A253, B371 or C426?

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,039
Which think Catherine?

20
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:15,039
Well, I think most chickens lay an egg once a day, so I think it's 371.

21
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:17,599
Well, we will have an answer later in the programme.

22
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,239
Now, for hierarchies and chickens.

23
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:25,599
In the radio programme, the Joy of 9-5, produced by something else for the BBC,

24
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,119
entrepreneur Margaret Heffanon describes an experiment.

25
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,079
In this experiment, researchers compared the egg production of a group of average chickens

26
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,159
to a group of super chickens.

27
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,119
That's chickens with an above average egg production.

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,000
Which was the most successful?

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,039
Here's Margaret Heffanon and, by the way, the noun for a group of chickens is a flock.

30
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,320
He compares the two flocks over six generations.

31
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,360
The average flock just gets better and better and better.

32
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,840
Egg production increases dramatically.

33
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,920
The super flock of super chickens at the end of six generations,

34
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,920
all but three are dead because the other three have killed the rest.

35
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:11,439
They've achieved their individual productivity by suppressing the productivity of the rest.

36
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,280
And that's what we do at work.

37
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,920
Which flock was most successful?

38
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,159
Well, the super flock actually killed each other,

39
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:26,159
so it turned out that the average flock laid more eggs in total and was more successful.

40
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:27,759
Yes, but why was that?

41
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,679
Well, the super chickens must have seen their other flock members,

42
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:34,719
not as colleagues, but as competitors.

43
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,519
Now, to understand this, we have to start with the word productivity.

44
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,799
This noun refers to the amount of work that's done.

45
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,600
So, on an individual level, the super chickens achieved productivity

46
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,880
because they suppressed the productivity of their flock members.

47
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,040
Suppressed here means they stopped the other chickens from being productive by killing them.

48
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,520
So, what do we learn from this experiment?

49
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,840
Well, Margaret Heffanon suggests that we see this kind of behaviour in the human workplace.

50
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,840
When everyone's equal, productivity is high,

51
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,080
but as soon as there's a hierarchy, as soon as there are managers,

52
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,560
things can go wrong because not all managers see their role as making life easier for the workers.

53
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,879
They demonstrate their productivity as managers by interfering with the productivity of the workers.

54
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,759
But there are other experiments which show that chickens are productive in a hierarchy.

55
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,319
How are those hierarchies different, though?

56
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,079
Here's Margaret Heffanon again.

57
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:41,199
So, chickens have an inbuilt or, if you like, an inherited hierarchy.

58
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,280
That's where we get the term pecking order from,

59
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,479
but it's one that they create among themselves,

60
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,199
rather than one that's imposed upon them.

61
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,639
So, which hierarchy works, at least for chickens?

62
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,199
Well, the best hierarchy is one that isn't imposed.

63
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,799
That means a good hierarchy isn't forced on the chickens.

64
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,960
They do well when they create the hierarchy themselves, naturally.

65
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,200
They work out the pecking order themselves.

66
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,600
Ah, pecking order is a great phrase.

67
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,360
We use it to describe levels of importance in an organisation.

68
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,560
The more important you are, the higher in the pecking order you are.

69
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,800
Where does this phrase originate?

70
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,400
Well, pecking describes what chickens do with their beaks.

71
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,040
They hit or bite other chickens with them,

72
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,600
and the most important or dominant chickens pack all the others.

73
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,120
The top chicken does all the pecking, middle-level chickens get pecked

74
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,120
and do some pecking themselves,

75
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,360
and some chickens are only pecked by other chickens.

76
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,960
So, there's a definite pecking order in chickens.

77
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,120
Right, time to review this week's vocabulary,

78
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,000
but before that, let's have the answer to the quiz.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,560
I asked what the record number of eggs laid by a single chicken in a year was.

80
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,600
The options were A, 253, B, 371,

81
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,879
or C, 426. What did you say, Catherine?

82
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,640
I said 371.

83
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,480
Well, lucky you. You're definitely the top of the pecking order, honey.

84
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,160
Because you are right.

85
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,600
That's a lot of eggs.

86
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,320
Indeed. Now, the vocabulary, we are talking about hierarchies.

87
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,640
A way to organise a society or workplace with different levels of importance.

88
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,760
An expression with a similar meaning is pecking order,

89
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,040
which relates to how important someone or a chicken is within a hierarchy.

90
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,040
A group of chickens is a flock.

91
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,439
It's also the general collective noun for birds as well, not just chickens.

92
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,240
Another of our words was the noun productivity,

93
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,120
which refers to the amount of work that is done.

94
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,360
And if you suppress someone's productivity,

95
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,800
you stop them from being as productive as they could be.

96
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,840
And finally, there was a verb to impose.

97
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,120
If you impose something, you force it on people.

98
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,520
For example, the government imposed new taxes on fuel.

99
00:05:57,599 --> 00:05:59,759
Well, that is the end of the program.
