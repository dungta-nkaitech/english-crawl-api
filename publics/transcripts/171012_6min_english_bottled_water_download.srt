00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,199
Welcome to 6 Minute English, where we introduce a refreshing topic

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,240
and six related items of vocabulary. I'm Rob.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,519
And I'm Neil, and today we're talking about water.

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,280
There's nothing more refreshing than an ice-cold bottle of water

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,960
straight out of the vending machine.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,359
Hmm.

10
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:34,560
Ah!

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,519
Okay, refreshing in this context means making you feel cool again after being hot.

12
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:41,840
So, has that called you down, Neil?

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,560
Yes, I feel very refreshed now, thanks.

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,879
Can I ask you, though, why didn't you just get a glass of water from the kitchen tap?

15
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,799
That water is cool and refreshing, too, and it's free.

16
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,320
Well, I like this brand of bottled water better.

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,640
It's enriched with salts and minerals that are very beneficial to your health.

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,799
Enriched means improving the quality of something by adding to it.

19
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,480
Enriched, honestly, Neil.

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,840
It tastes better, Rob.

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,560
Yeah.

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,400
And I'm not the only one who thinks so.

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,120
For the first time in the UK, bottled water is more popular than cola.

24
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,680
In fact, can you tell me how many litres of bottled water were sold in the UK in 2016?

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,799
Was it a 2.9 billion litres?

26
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,079
B, 29 million litres or C, 2.9 million litres.

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,519
Right. Well, I'm going to say 29 million litres.

28
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,640
Okay. We'll find out later if you got that right or wrong.

29
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,840
But seriously, Rob, don't you think it's a good thing that people are choosing to buy bottled

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,799
water at the supermarket rather than fizzy drinks?

31
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,519
Yes, of course, but as I said to you earlier, why don't people just drink tap water?

32
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,079
Let's listen to Natalie Feek, founder of City to Sea, which campaigns against plastic pollution.

33
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,599
And of course, bottled water causes a huge amount of that.

34
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:07,599
Here's Natalie now, talking about how drinks manufacturers have persuaded people that bottled water

35
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,639
is better for them.

36
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,919
They manufactured the demand for bottled water, and they spent millions of pounds on adverts,

37
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,079
sort of scaring us off of tap water.

38
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:24,159
The bottled water companies set out to make us believe that tap water wasn't healthy,

39
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:30,079
and yet tap water is way more regulated than bottled water is, and in taste tests tap water

40
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,519
comes up drunk most times.

41
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,599
If you manufacture something, you make it in large amounts in a factory.

42
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,039
But here, Natalie says the drinks companies manufactured the demand for bottled water,

43
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:48,479
which means they made adverts to persuade people that tap water wasn't healthy,

44
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,759
and bottled water was.

45
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,639
Hmm, to scare people off. What does that mean, Rob?

46
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,959
Well, if you scare somebody off, you make them go away by frightening them.

47
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,959
So some advertisers may have suggested, for example, that tap water was unsafe to drink,

48
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,399
whereas bottled water was safer and tasted better too.

49
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:07,759
You're catching on.

50
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:13,359
However, Natalie Fee claims that tap water is more regulated than bottled water is.

51
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,280
Regulated means controlled.

52
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,840
Natalie also says that in taste tests tap water comes up trumps.

53
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,199
What does she mean by that?

54
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:26,479
Well, a taste test is where you ask people to try several very similar products

55
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:31,519
without knowing which one is which, and then you grade them according to which you like the best.

56
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,439
And if something comes up trumps, it means it produces a good result often unexpectedly.

57
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,759
So tap water comes up trumps, eh?

58
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,560
Yep.

59
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,039
Perhaps we should try a taste test now, Neil.

60
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:48,159
It would be interesting to see if your enriched bottled water comes up trumps or not.

61
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,639
I'll tell you what, let's leave that until later,

62
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,520
and here the answer to today's quiz question instead.

63
00:03:53,520 --> 00:04:00,240
Okay. I asked you how many litres of bottled water was sold in the UK in 2016?

64
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,800
Was it a 2.9 billion litres, b 29 million litres,

65
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,760
or c 2.9 million litres?

66
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,560
Yeah, and I said 29 million litres.

67
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,480
And the answer is 2.9 billion litres.

68
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,520
Wow.

69
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,000
You can buy many different brands of bottled water with a range of price tags.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,400
At the top end, there's water from a 4,000-year-old Norwegian iceberg.

71
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,840
Hmm, how much does that cost?

72
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,680
Around 80 pounds of bottle.

73
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,199
Oh, as cheap as that.

74
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,199
I'll pop out and get some later.

75
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,439
Okay, let's review the words we learned today.

76
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,839
The first one was refreshing,

77
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,040
which means making you feel cool again after being hot.

78
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,360
I enjoyed a refreshing cup of tea.

79
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,600
Hmm, we British like to say that, don't we?

80
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,800
Though I don't understand how a hot drink can be refreshing.

81
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
Okay, number two, enriched,

82
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,199
which means improving the quality of something by adding to it.

83
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,120
For example, did you know that many types of breakfast cereal are enriched with vitamins and minerals, Neil?

84
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,839
No, I didn't, Rob. You learn something new every day.

85
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,039
Number three is manufacture to make something in large amounts in a factory.

86
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,959
This company manufactures Wellington Boots.

87
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,560
I'm a Wellington Boot manufacturer. That has a nice ring to it.

88
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,439
Anyway, when you scare someone off, you make them go away by frightening them.

89
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,879
The dog barked fiercely and scared off the two burglars.

90
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,079
Grrrr.

91
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:24,959
Down, Rob, down.

92
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:28,479
Number five, regulated or controlled.

93
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,120
For example, the sale of tobacco is tightly regulated by the government.

94
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,200
And finally, if something comes up trumps, it produces a good result often unexpectedly.

95
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,879
My lottery ticket came up trumps again. I can't believe it.

96
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,920
You're a lucky man, Neil.

97
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,120
Okay, it's time to do that taste test now.

98
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,160
If you have an opinion on bottled water or anything else,

99
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,960
please tell us about it on our Twitter, Instagram, Facebook or YouTube pages.

100
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,360
Okay.

101
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,080
This one definitely tastes better.

102
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:01,759
And how about this one?

103
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:02,960
Hmm.

104
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:04,640
Hmm.

105
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,240
Yeah, definitely.

106
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,640
Ah, that's the tap water, Neil.

107
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
No, no, no, I refuse to believe it.
