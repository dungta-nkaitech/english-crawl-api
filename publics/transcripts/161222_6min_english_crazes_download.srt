5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,519
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,559
And I'm Neil.

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,080
Neil, what are you doing?

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,679
I saw Squirtle and I'm trying to catch it.

9
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:23,440
What are you talking about?

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,320
Pokemon Go, Alice. I'm trying to catch Pokemon.

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,359
What?

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,719
Alice, keep up.

13
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,320
Pokemon Go is a game where these little virtual monsters

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,200
pop up onto your phone and you have to catch them.

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,320
There it is again.

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,039
Ah, gotcha. I got Squirtle.

17
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,159
Well done, Neil.

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,640
Now the subject of today's show is Crazes.

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,960
And Pokemon Go is a good example.

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,239
When it was first released, so many people were downloading the app

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,560
that servers were crashing all over the place.

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,039
Hmm, perhaps I should explain at this point that a craze or a fad

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,159
is a sudden and widespread enthusiasm for something,

24
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,079
which only lasts a short time.

25
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,560
So why do you think this craze for Pokemon Go took off, Neil?

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,719
It uses augmented reality, and that's exciting new technology.

27
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,000
It's fun to play outside, and the game was released over the summer

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,079
when people want to be outside.

29
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,480
And people are already familiar with the monsters

30
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,120
since they were created back in 1995.

31
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,680
Hmm, augmented reality, by the way,

32
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,600
is where digital information is layered on top of what you see

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,520
through a smartphone or other device, augmenting or adding to it.

34
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,120
I love this game, but then again, I loved other games in the past.

35
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,240
I still have some toys and gadgets from my childhood at home.

36
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,719
If there was a fad, I would join in, I'm afraid.

37
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:45,440
Hmm, well, let me test your knowledge about toys that turned into fads.

38
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,280
Tell me, what is the best selling toy of all time?

39
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,520
Is it A, the space hopper?

40
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,840
B, the Rubik's Cube, also known as Magic Cube?

41
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,479
Or C, the Cabbage Patch Doll?

42
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,399
I'll say B, the Rubik's Cube.

43
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,000
I have one, and so does my cousin, my neighbour, my brother, my...

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,960
Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right or not later on in the show.

45
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,479
But why do we like to participate in crazes?

46
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:20,079
Dr Ben McAlyss, a clinical psychologist from Columbia University in the US, explains.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,640
When a person or a group perceives an idea or a process or a product

48
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,960
as being beneficial to one person or to a group of people,

49
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,719
they immediately want to experience that benefit for themselves,

50
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:42,879
which hooks into an ancient evolutionary fear of being left behind or abandoned by our tribes,

51
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,560
and so more people join in.

52
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,120
So Ben McAlyss believes that people join crazes because they're afraid of being abandoned

53
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,800
by others in their group.

54
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,000
But I don't think that's true for me. I just enjoy playing games.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,960
Yes, but why have you switched from angry birds to Minecraft to Pokemon Go in the space of a year?

56
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,520
And before that, there was candy crush and...

57
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,599
Well, I get bored after a while.

58
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,280
So it isn't because other people stop playing it, and they stop talking about it,

59
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,360
and it stops being a group thing?

60
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,640
Maybe, there is an element of that.

61
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,879
Anyway, I like the idea that we join a craze because it's beneficial or good for us.

62
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,479
Hmm, I'm not convinced that playing Pokemon Go is beneficial.

63
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:30,000
Did you know, Neil, that in terms of personality type,

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,639
people who are more emotionally insecure are far more likely to follow a craze?

65
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,719
You know, sort of, herd mentality.

66
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:42,159
Herd mentality describes how people are influenced by their peers to adopt certain behaviors.

67
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,799
But it's fun to be connected with others through a craze.

68
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,479
Aren't you troubled by FOMO?

69
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,439
FOMO, FOMO, or fear of missing out?

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,239
Oh no, I have a strong sense of self.

71
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:55,919
But... well...

72
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,519
I must admit, I like loom bands.

73
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,599
Do you remember those little rubber bands you could make jewelry and other stuff out of?

74
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,479
Yes, I remember.

75
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,639
David Beckham wore a loom band bracelet.

76
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,479
Hmm, so did the Duchess of Cambridge.

77
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,120
They were very popular a couple of years ago, and came from a simple idea.

78
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,000
Chong Chun, um, an immigrant from Malaysia living in the United States,

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,920
invented the rainbow loom after watching his daughters play.

80
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,040
Let's hear his story.

81
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,240
The idea of loom band came from my daughters,

82
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,399
so one day they came home from school.

83
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,800
Two of them were teaching each other how to make rubber band bracelets from those small tiny,

84
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,720
ponytail-sized rubber bands.

85
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,959
I tried to impress them by making a thicker bracelet

86
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,319
that was made from a prototype loom that I fabricated.

87
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,519
And it was a success and they were telling me that those bracelets are so cool.

88
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,399
Can you make more?

89
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,799
Chong Chun, um, made a prototype, a first model of a machine from which all others would develop.

90
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:07,919
He posted a video of his daughters making the bracelets and these went viral on the internet.

91
00:05:08,799 --> 00:05:09,759
Interesting.

92
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,120
Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question.

93
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,519
Yes, I asked, what is the best selling toy of all time?

94
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:23,599
Is it a, the space hopper, the Rubik's Cube, also known as Magic Cube,

95
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:25,759
or c, the Cabbage Patch Doll?

96
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,360
It has to be the Rubik's Cube.

97
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,839
And indeed it is.

98
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,920
In the 35 years since the puzzle was available to buy outside of Hungary,

99
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,759
where it's inventor came from,

100
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,159
approximately 350 million Rubik's cubes have been sold,

101
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,959
making it the world's best selling toy.

102
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,399
And their clever little toys, I must say, there's some maths in them.

103
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Now, let's hear the words we learned today.

104
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,599
They were craze,

105
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,159
fad, augmented reality,

106
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,319
beneficial,

107
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,719
herd mentality,

108
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,720
fomo,

109
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,800
prototype.

110
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,680
And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

111
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,600
Don't forget to join us again soon.

112
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,240
Bye bye.
