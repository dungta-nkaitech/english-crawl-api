4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,960
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,280
And I'm Neil. Did you have a good weekend, Alice?

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,559
Yes, but it flew by, which means it went quickly.

7
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,719
And here we are again, back at work.

8
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:24,160
I know what you mean.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,560
Though I must say time really dragged for me,

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,240
and that means it went slowly.

11
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,239
I was on a train which broke down.

12
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:30,959
Oh, dear.

13
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:33,039
And it felt like it took forever to arrive,

14
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:35,759
though actually it was only delayed by one hour.

15
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,359
Well, today we are talking about our perception of

16
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,359
or the way we see time.

17
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:43,759
It's true that when we're busy doing lots of things,

18
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:44,959
time flies by.

19
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:46,640
And when we're bored,

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,719
we'll have nothing to do. It drags.

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,280
And I didn't have anything to do on the train.

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,840
Do you think time flows at the same rate for everyone?

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,560
Even animals?

24
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,759
My cat doesn't get bored doing nothing all day.

25
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:00,000
I wonder if time drags for her sometimes.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,439
Good question.

27
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,400
Did you know Neil that, according to a new study,

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,719
smaller animals perceive time as if

29
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,799
it is passing in slow motion?

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,640
Oh, that sounds weird.

31
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,519
Do you think they hear us like this?

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,759
Torqueen slowly.

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,000
Don't be silly, Neil.

34
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,680
What I meant was that small animals,

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,000
such as insects and small birds,

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,360
can observe more detail in a certain period of time.

37
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,240
For example, a second than larger animals.

38
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,160
And how does this help them exactly?

39
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,480
It sounds like the day would really drag

40
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,440
if every second got stretched out like that.

41
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,000
It helps them by giving them time to escape larger predators.

42
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:49,200
Now, I have a question for you, Neil.

43
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,600
Can you tell me roughly how much more quickly a flies eye

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,839
can react than a human eye?

45
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:58,319
Is it a twice as quickly,

46
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,399
b four times as quickly,

47
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,479
or c 10 times as quickly?

48
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,280
Well, I'll go for c 10 times.

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,719
Flies are pretty nippy,

50
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,400
and that's another word for quick.

51
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,479
Yes, well, we'll find out later on

52
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,719
if you've got the answer right or not.

53
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:15,680
Now, small animals can typically process

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,079
more visual information than we can.

55
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,759
But in a dangerous situation,

56
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,680
our brains can work in overdrive

57
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,920
to process information more quickly.

58
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,360
And overdrive means a state of extreme activity.

59
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,840
Let's listen to Raza Rumi,

60
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,560
a writer and broadcaster in Pakistan,

61
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,120
talking about the unusual way his brain worked

62
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,599
when gunmen opened fire on him in his car.

63
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
It lasted for a few minutes,

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,560
but to me that particular incident feels like it was for hours.

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,000
I think my brain was working in a very strange way,

66
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,199
parallel and multiple thoughts

67
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,520
and streams of consciousness were sort of running along.

68
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,240
I have to save my head because

69
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,479
if I get a bullet in my brain, I'm dead.

70
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,199
And at the same time,

71
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,400
was it all worth it?

72
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,639
And that's what a short life it was.

73
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,920
It was lovely.

74
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,560
I was petrified that I'm going to die.

75
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,360
Raza Rumi there.

76
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,080
So he was petrified by the attack,

77
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,080
which means extremely frightened.

78
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,440
As a result, his brain started working in a strange way.

79
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,960
He was thinking and feeling lots of different things at the same time.

80
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,920
That's right.

81
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,000
He remembers thinking practical thoughts like I have to save my head.

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,400
But in parallel or at the same time,

83
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,120
he also remembers having philosophical thoughts,

84
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,360
such as what a short life it was.

85
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,080
It was lovely.

86
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,880
Have you ever been in a dangerous situation

87
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,800
where your brain went into overdrive?

88
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,240
Yeah, I was 10 years old

89
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,280
and I fell backwards out of a big tree in our garden.

90
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,000
Oh, no.

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,600
Yeah, I have a vivid memory of the sun flashing above me

92
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,600
and the clouds moving across the sky

93
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,920
and the leaves rustling in the trees above me.

94
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,000
My mom was screaming through the kitchen window as she saw me fall.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,040
I experienced so much in the space of just a few seconds.

96
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,520
Just like Raza Rumi describes.

97
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,360
Yes, a vivid memory, by the way, is clear and detailed.

98
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,120
How poor Neil, did you hurt yourself?

99
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,439
Some big bruises, but no broken bones.

100
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,560
Glad to hear it.

101
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,680
Now, it's a strange trick of memory

102
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,199
that in a scary situation,

103
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,319
your brain starts to record everything in great detail.

104
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,600
And the more memory you have of an event,

105
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,759
the longer you believe it took.

106
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,159
This idea explains why children often feel

107
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,680
that time is passing slowly

108
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,759
because their experiences are new

109
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,839
and they are creating lots of new memories.

110
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,560
Whereas boring grown-ups like us

111
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,120
are following routines that don't require new memories

112
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,399
because they're so familiar.

113
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,959
But let's listen to Claudia Hammond,

114
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,560
author of Time Warped,

115
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,959
talking about how we can stretch time

116
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:53,439
and make our days feel longer in a good way.

117
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,879
If you can spend your weekend filling it

118
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,199
with loads of new different activities,

119
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,279
it will go fast at the time because you're having fun.

120
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,279
But when you look back, say, on Sunday night

121
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,799
and you've got to go to work next day,

122
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:06,479
it will feel as if your weekend was long

123
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,079
because you filled it with new memories.

124
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,879
We should do that this weekend, Neil.

125
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:11,519
What do you think?

126
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,319
Definitely.

127
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,079
I'm going to buzz around like a fly

128
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:15,759
creating loads of new memories.

129
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,359
Now, are you ready for the answer to today's quiz question?

130
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:23,519
I asked roughly how much more quickly a fly's eye

131
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:25,599
can react than a human eye?

132
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:28,000
Is it A, twice as quickly,

133
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,839
B, four times as quickly,

134
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:32,399
or C, ten times as quickly?

135
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,279
And I said C, ten times as quickly.

136
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,039
The correct answer is B, four times as quickly.

137
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:42,159
Flys have eyes that send updates to the brain

138
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,240
at much higher frequencies than our eyes

139
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,560
because they can process the information more quickly.

140
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,760
This speed illustrates the impressive capabilities

141
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,840
of even the smallest animal brains.

142
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,280
Well, before we buzz off,

143
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,840
perhaps we should hear the words we learned today.

144
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,040
They are, flew by, dragged,

145
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,560
perception, nippy, overdrive,

146
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,120
petrified, in parallel.

147
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,520
Well, that's the end of today's six-minute English.

148
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,440
Remember to join us again soon.

149
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,240
Bye.

150
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
English from the BBC.
