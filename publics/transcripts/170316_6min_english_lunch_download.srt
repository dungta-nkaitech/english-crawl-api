From BBC Learning English

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,120
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English,

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,120
the show that brings you an interesting topic,

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,440
authentic listening practice and six items

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,679
of incredibly useful vocabulary.

9
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:21,359
I'm Dan and I'm Neil.

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,039
In this program, we'll be discussing

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,800
the lovely topic of lunch

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,600
and what our lunch choices say about us.

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,560
So Dan,

14
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:30,239
what are you doing for lunch today?

15
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,640
Ah, Neil, are you asking me to join you?

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,759
I'd love to!

17
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:34,479
Thanks!

18
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:36,399
There's this great little Vietnamese place

19
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,359
we have to check out.

20
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,879
It's right next to the office if you just...

21
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,840
Ah, actually, I was just asking to open up today's topic.

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,039
Sorry, you see, I've brought a sandwich.

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,719
Oh, a sandwich.

24
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:50,079
Again.

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,320
How dull.

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,920
Well, you're not the only one.

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,960
A survey from 2012 showed a third of Britain's

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,920
eat exactly the same thing for lunch every day.

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,399
And yes, it's mostly sandwiches.

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,920
I had a carry yesterday.

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,280
Well, it's almost lunch time,

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,799
so we'd better get on with our question.

33
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,920
Which is,

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,439
how long is the average lunch break in the UK?

35
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,159
Is it...

36
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,000
A, an hour and a half,

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,359
B, 45 minutes, or C, 25 minutes?

38
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,280
Oh, I wish it was an hour and a half,

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,560
but I'm pretty sure it must be C, 25 minutes.

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,480
Well, we'll find out if you're right,

41
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,000
just before lunch.

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,040
All this talk of lunch is actually making me feel a bit peckish.

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,760
Peckish.

44
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,200
That's a great word, isn't it?

45
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,599
It's a slang word for being a bit hungry,

46
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,879
feeling peckish, Dan.

47
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:35,840
I am now.

48
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,840
Now, about you and your sandwiches, Neil.

49
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,719
Two slices of bread with filling might be the most

50
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,480
popular British lunch choice,

51
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,319
but it didn't used to be that way.

52
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,240
Listen to food writer B Wilson,

53
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,960
which adjective does she use to describe sandwiches?

54
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,640
They were what you had in emergency.

55
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,560
They were what you had on a long train journey.

56
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,079
It was a kind of makeshift lunch

57
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,760
when you couldn't get anything better.

58
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,440
So sandwiches had humble origins as makeshift meals.

59
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,640
Makeshift describes something temporary and low quality,

60
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,480
a solution you create when you can't do anything better.

61
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,920
I can't help feel all this is getting a little personal, Dan.

62
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,879
There's a sometimes very practical reason to eat a sandwich.

63
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,920
Like on a train.

64
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,200
On a weekday in the office, though, there's no excuse.

65
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,280
Well, if you worked as hard as I did, Dan,

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,840
you'd only have time for a sandwich,

67
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,319
which is just what B Wilson was saying.

68
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,039
We treat lunch time as if it were an emergency.

69
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,560
It says something about our attitude to work and food in the UK.

70
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,280
Next, let's hear from philosopher Julian Bagini

71
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,239
with his view on eating the same thing every day.

72
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,319
And let's teach one more word first,

73
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,680
utilitarian.

74
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,079
It describes something practical and useful,

75
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,680
rather than attractive.

76
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,359
What lunch says about us is that we're still very much stuck

77
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:49,759
in this kind of quite functional,

78
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,479
you know, efficient utilitarian attitude

79
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,719
of how we should construct our daily lives.

80
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,959
And for all our embrace of this great food culture and everything,

81
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,639
we haven't managed to make that.

82
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,839
And every day thing, it remains something for the special occasions.

83
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,639
So he thinks we live in a world where we value being efficient,

84
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,239
where we have a functional utilitarian attitude to life.

85
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:12,959
Exactly.

86
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,879
We're aware of a great food culture.

87
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,000
We embrace this culture, but only for special occasions.

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,319
Yes, let's look at that word embrace.

89
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,319
It normally means this.

90
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,239
Let me just, um,

91
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,479
oh, Neil, I didn't know you cared.

92
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,680
Neil just hugged me.

93
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,159
Wrap his arms around me, embraced me.

94
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,959
Just as we can embrace physical things in people,

95
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,039
we can also embrace ideas.

96
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,719
Here's an idea I embrace, Neil.

97
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,639
We should all embrace new foods,

98
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,000
broaden our horizons.

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,199
To broaden our horizons means to open our minds

100
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,560
and experience new things.

101
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,719
Let me broaden your horizons right now.

102
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,199
Experts from Cornell University say it leads

103
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,639
to better team spirit if colleagues eat together.

104
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,079
Okay, I get the picture.

105
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:56,719
I should ditch my sandwich and eat with you

106
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,319
in the name of team spirit.

107
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,719
That is getting on well with team members

108
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,799
having a feeling of belonging.

109
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:03,839
Finally.

110
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:04,799
Vietnamese?

111
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,560
Oh, yes, but not before you tell me the answer to today's question.

112
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,959
How long do Brits take for lunch?

113
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,599
Well, the answer was C, 25 minutes.

114
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,319
That comes from a survey done by the BBC this year

115
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,879
to find out about our modern dining habits.

116
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,839
25 minutes.

117
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,199
It's a crying shame, Dan.

118
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,800
But before we have lunch ourselves,

119
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,439
let's run over the vocabulary one more time.

120
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,800
First up, we had Peckish.

121
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,680
It means hungry, just a little hungry.

122
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,759
I'm feeling rather peckish at the moment.

123
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,159
I think I've gone beyond Peckish, Dan.

124
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,439
Roll on lunch.

125
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,120
Next, we had MakeShift,

126
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,639
which describes a temporary or low-quality solution.

127
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,000
For example, last week my team's goalkeeper was sick,

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,719
so I had to replace him as a MakeShift goalie.

129
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,000
Or another example,

130
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,120
when I was a student, I used the steel bin in my room

131
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,560
as a MakeShift drum.

132
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,320
I'm sure the neighbours loved that.

133
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,880
Mm-hmm.

134
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,360
Now, what about this word utilitarian?

135
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,640
In the context we used, it means simple and functional

136
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,920
rather than beautiful.

137
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,720
Do you think it would be fair to describe your polo shirt

138
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,000
as utilitarian?

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,480
I prefer classic and timeless.

140
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,000
Please.

141
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,440
Well, enough of all this banter.

142
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,720
You know, I believe we should all just get along.

143
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,320
Oh, are you going to hug me again?

144
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
To embrace me, not this time,

145
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,720
let's stick with the metaphorical meaning

146
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,200
to accept a new belief or idea.

147
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,080
For example, I wasn't sure about the new website design,

148
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,080
but now I fully embrace it.

149
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,640
Very nice.

150
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,920
And I embrace your suggestion that colleagues should eat together.

151
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,840
It looks like you've broadened your horizons.

152
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,960
Well, when I taught English in Spain, Japan, Poland,

153
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,840
and the Czech Republic, it really broadened my horizons

154
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,760
and taught me about new ways of life.

155
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,560
How about you?

156
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,720
Yes, they say travel broadens the mind.

157
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,040
It's certainly broadened my horizons, too.

158
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,840
Even better.

159
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,680
Why don't we go traveling together

160
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,520
with the whole learning English team?

161
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah, that would be wonderful for team spirit,

162
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,840
the good feeling of being together.

163
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,520
Maybe to Cambodia?

164
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,720
It certainly would.

165
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,120
That's the end of today's six minute English.

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,840
