3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,040
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,160
And I'm Beth.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,280
Shhh! Quiet, please. I'm trying to read here, Beth.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,800
Oh, excuse me. I didn't know this was a library.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,600
Well, what exactly is a library? Have you ever thought about that?

8
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,000
Well, somewhere with lots of books, I suppose, where you go to read or study.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,840
A symbol of knowledge and learning, a place to keep warm in the winter,

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,200
or somewhere to murder victims in a crime novel.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,800
Libraries can be all of these things and more.

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,040
In this programme, we'll be looking into the hidden life of the library,

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,600
including one of the most famous, the great library of Alexandra,

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,560
founded in ancient Egypt, in around 285 BCE.

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,240
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,920
and doing it all in a whisper, so as not to disturb anyone.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,520
Glad to hear it.

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,719
But before we get out our library cards, I have a question for you, Beth.

19
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,120
Founded in 1973 in central London, the British library

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,719
is one of the largest libraries in the world, containing around 200 million books.

21
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,400
But which of the following can be found on its shelves?

22
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,320
Is it A, the earliest known printing of the Bible?

23
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,040
B, the first edition of the Times newspaper from 1788,

24
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,520
C, the original manuscripts of the Harry Potter books.

25
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,080
I'll guess it's the first edition of the famous British newspaper, the Times.

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,680
Okay, Beth, I'll reveal the answer at the end of the programme.

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,360
Libraries mean different things to different people,

28
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,360
so who better to ask than someone who has written the book on it?

29
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,000
Literally, Professor Andrew Pettigree is the author of a new book,

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,719
A Fragile History of the Library.

31
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:05,439
Here he explains what a library means to him on BBC Radio 3 programme, Art and Ideas.

32
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,840
Well, in my view, a library is any collection of books,

33
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,800
which is deliberately put together by its owner or patron.

34
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:20,480
So in the 15th century, a library can be 30 manuscripts

35
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,520
painfully put together during the course of a lifetime,

36
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,200
or it can be two shelves of paperbacks in your home.

37
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,080
Andrew defines a library as any collection of books someone has intentionally built up.

38
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,960
This could be as simple as a few paperbacks,

39
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,480
cheap books with a cover made of thick paper.

40
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:45,039
Today, books are available everywhere from supermarkets to train stations,

41
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,000
but back in history, that wasn't the case.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,919
In earlier centuries, printed books or manuscripts were rare,

43
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,359
and may have been painfully collected over many years.

44
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,799
Andrew uses the advert painfully or painstakingly to describe something

45
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:02,879
which took a lot of care and effort to do.

46
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,399
But paperback books and private collections are only part of the story.

47
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,719
You may not believe it, but libraries are places of power.

48
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:19,120
To find out why, we have to go back in time to the ancient Egyptian port of Alexandria

49
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,439
in the 3rd century BCE.

50
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,719
The great library of Alexandria held the largest collection of books in the ancient world.

51
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:29,680
Founded in the city built by Alexander the Great,

52
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,640
the library's mission was to bring together a copy of every book then in existence.

53
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:38,159
According to history professor Islam Issa,

54
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,719
there were two reasons why the great library made Alexandria so powerful.

55
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,359
As he explained to BBC Radio 3 program, art and ideas.

56
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:52,239
The first is being in a location at the intersection of the continents

57
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,159
and bringing a diverse set of people together to live in harmony or relative harmony

58
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,159
can bring about economic prosperity.

59
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,520
And the second is quite simply that knowledge equals power.

60
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,439
And so the library is a form of soft power.

61
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,560
It's a way of saying that Alexandria is an important centre of knowledge,

62
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,719
a regional capital by being the guardians of knowledge.

63
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:22,240
Alexandria was the meeting point of different cultures

64
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,839
where different ideas and philosophies were exchanged.

65
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,360
This atmosphere encouraged people to live in harmony,

66
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,920
peacefully and cooperatively with each other.

67
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,120
But the main reason for the great library's importance is that knowledge equals power,

68
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,720
a saying meaning that the more someone knows the more they will be able to control events.

69
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,720
Alexandria became the capital of soft power,

70
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,240
the use of political and cultural knowledge rather than military power to influence events.

71
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,480
Now maybe it's time to reveal the answer to your question Neil.

72
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,360
Sure, I asked you which famous text could be found in the British Library.

73
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,600
I guess it was the first edition of the Times newspaper.

74
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,640
So was I right?

75
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,520
That was the correct answer.

76
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,040
In the British Library you'll find the first copy of the Times,

77
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,480
along with the first editions of many famous books.

78
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,720
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this program, starting with

79
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,920
an exclamation used to ask someone to be quiet.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,240
A paperback is a type of book with a cover made of thick paper and sold relatively cheaply.

81
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,360
Doing something painstakingly or painfully means doing it in a way showing that lots of care

82
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,600
and effort has been taken. Harmony is a situation where people cooperate peacefully with each other.

83
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,160
According to the expression knowledge equals power, the more you know,

84
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,400
the more you're able to control events.

85
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:58,799
And finally, soft power involves using political or cultural means rather than

86
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:03,839
military power to get what you want. Once again, our six minutes are up.

87
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,120
Goodbye for now.

88
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,599
Goodbye.
