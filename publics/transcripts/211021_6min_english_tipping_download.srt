Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Sam.

3
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:25,600
And I'm Neil. In this program we're talking all about restaurants, specifically about

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,240
tipping. That's giving money to waiting staff for the service you received.

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,320
Yes, while tipping is discretionary, which means that someone could decide whether they want to

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,400
give money or not, in most places in the UK it's an expected practice.

7
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:47,600
But have you ever thought whether money goes or who actually receives it? Do they have to pay

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,560
tax on it? Or is it just a gift? Some people think that the person who brought our food is the one

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,800
who gets the money. However, that isn't always the case. Well, before we find out more about

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,719
where our tips go, I have a question about restaurants. The highest restaurant in the world

11
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:14,480
at Massphere is in Dubai in the building known as the Burj Khalifa. But how high up is that

12
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,079
restaurant? Is it a 442 metres? B, 500.
