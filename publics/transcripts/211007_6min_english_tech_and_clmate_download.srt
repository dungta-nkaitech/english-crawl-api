Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:25,199
And I'm Sam. These days, our lives are filled with devices that were unimaginable only a few years ago.

4
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,519
The sorts of things you read about in science fiction novels that never thought you'd own.

5
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:37,679
Yes, like those robots that vacuum your floor or voice-activated lights. We call many of these things

6
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:43,519
smart tech. But while they can help with the little tasks at home, some people are wondering whether

7
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:49,600
they can help fight climate change. Yes, smart homes, regulating things like the temperature,

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,560
are a step in the right direction. Using AI to learn when the house is occupied and the optimal time

9
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,679
to fire up for heating is one way to limit wasteful use of resources.

10
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,640
The problem comes from the origin of the energy which powers these home systems. If it's fossil fuels

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,159
then digging them up an informal way of saying removing something from the earth and burning them

12
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,760
creates carbon emissions. I suppose that's why many people are trying to find more

13
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,280
renewable forms of energy to reduce their carbon footprint.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,400
Well, it's interesting that you mentioned carbon footprint because my question is about that

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,200
today. How many tons of carbon dioxide are humans responsible for emitting into the atmosphere

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:42,719
every year? Is it more than a 30 billion, b 40 billion or c 50 billion?

17
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,040
Well, Neil, that all sounds like a lot to me, but I'll go straight down the middle and say b

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,320
40 billion tons. Okay, Sam will find out the correct answer at the end of the program.

19
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,840
So you mentioned earlier that people are looking into ways to use more renewable energy,

20
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,040
but there are also some problems with that form of energy production.

21
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:09,920
Yes, for example, many of these technologies rely on certain weather conditions which affect

22
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:18,640
the levels of energy production. Dr. NS Abu Harmad, CEO of H2Go, is working on a project in Orkney,

23
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,679
an island off the coast of Scotland, testing ways of storing renewable forms of energy.

24
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,679
Here she is on the BBC World Service Programme Crowd Science, speaking with Greia Jackson,

25
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:33,119
talking about the limitations of renewable energy sources.

26
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:38,879
Renewable energy is intermittent by its nature because we're dependent and relying on

27
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:45,919
the weather, when the sun shines and when the wind blows and these line nature are not 24

28
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,319
hour seven, reliable constant. And that means that demand doesn't always meet.

29
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,000
Supply renewables, it can mean that we get blackouts, but on the other hand, it means that when

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,239
the sun is up and we are producing all that power or when the wind is blowing and we're producing

31
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,599
power, we might not be able to use that energy. There's no demand for it. And so it's wasted.

32
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:14,239
So Dr. NS Abu Harmad said the renewable energy is intermittent, which means that something is not

33
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:21,040
continuous or has many breaks. She also said that because there isn't always a steady stream of

34
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:28,000
energy, we can get blackouts, periods of time without energy. People like Dr. NS Abu Harmad are

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,040
trying to find solutions to make renewable energy storage devices, which would make the

36
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,160
supply of energy more constant. Smart tech can also help with this problem with renewable resources.

37
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,280
Now of course, not only can computers be used to design efficient models, but smart tech

38
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,159
can also be used to improve performance after things like wind turbines have been installed.

39
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,079
Here is Greia Jackson, Science Broadcaster and podcaster, speaking about how smart tech can

40
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,560
improve efficiency on BBC World Service Programme, Crowd Science.

41
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,759
Some engineers use something called a digital twin. This is really interesting actually.

42
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,679
This is where lots of sensors are attached to the wind turbine so it can be

43
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,000
modelled on a computer in real time. And then using machine learning, you can then simulate

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,519
what's happening to the wind turbine in specific weather conditions. And this is important

45
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,519
because it means they can make sure they're performing at their best.

46
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,800
Greia Jackson used the expression in real time, which means without delay or live.

47
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,520
And she also mentioned machine learning, which is the way computers change their behaviour

48
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,000
based on data they collected. And she also said simulate, produce a computer model of something.

49
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,840
So while there are issues with the reliability of the source of renewable energy,

50
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,439
it's clear that people are working on solutions such as energy storage to make sure there is always

51
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:01,519
a supply. And that computers can be used to design and operate technology as efficiently as possible.

52
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,680
Much in the same way that AI can be used in your home to make it run as efficiently as possible.

53
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,519
Yes, all in the hope of reducing your carbon footprint.

54
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,839
Which reminds me of your quiz question, Neil.

55
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,480
Yes, in my quiz question, I asked Sam how many tons of carbon dioxide humans produce each year?

56
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,080
And I went for B, 40 billion tons.

57
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,080
Which is the correct answer, well done, Sam.

58
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,040
Wow, I guess right. But all three of those numbers aren't really, really high.

59
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,040
Let's recap the vocabulary from today's programme about smart tech and climate change,

60
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:43,520
starting with dig something up. An informal expression, which means to remove something from the

61
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,080
ground. Intermittent is used to describe something that is not continuous or steady.

62
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,839
Blackouts are periods of time without energy, for example electricity.

63
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,719
In real time means without delay or live.

64
00:05:56,719 --> 00:06:03,919
Machine learning is the process by which computers learn and change behaviour based on data.

65
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,759
And finally, simulate means produce a computer model.

66
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,639
And that's all for this programme. Bye for now.

67
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,919
Goodbye.
