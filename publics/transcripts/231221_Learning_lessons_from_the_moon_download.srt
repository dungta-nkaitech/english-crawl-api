00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,759
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:19,559
And I'm Georgie. That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. Famous words.

4
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:24,560
But do you know who said them? Of course, that was Neil Armstrong, the first person to land

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,359
on the moon. Right. The Apollo 11 spacecraft landed Neil

6
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:34,519
Armstrong on the moon on 20th July 1969. But in decades after that famous event,

7
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:38,920
interest in returning to the moon faded away. Until now.

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:45,760
Summer 2023 saw the start of a new race for the moon between Russia's Lunar 25 spacecraft

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:54,000
and India's Chandrayan 3. Russia's rocket crashed on landing, but Chandrayan 3 successfully

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,600
touched down on the 23rd of August, making India only the fourth country to successfully

11
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,120
land on the moon. But why this sudden interest in going back to the moon? That's what we'll

12
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,760
be discussing in this programme, and as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:17,760
too. But before we blast off, I have a question for you, Georgie. Everyone knows that Neil Armstrong

14
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,879
was the first man on the moon and was followed by a second astronaut Buzz Aldrin. But who

15
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:29,679
was the third Apollo astronaut who flew the command module while his crewmates walked

16
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:37,079
on the moon? Was it a Yuri Gagarin, b Michael Collins or C. Allen Sheppard?

17
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,159
Hmm, I think it was Michael Collins.

18
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,399
Okay, Georgie, we'll find out the answer at the end of the programme.

19
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:51,399
In some ways, the current interest in the moon is really more about the origins of Earth.

20
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:56,600
One theory is that during the early days of the solar system, around four billion years

21
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:03,880
ago, another planet crashed into Earth, breaking off a part, which then formed the moon. Unlike

22
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:10,879
the Earth's surface, which is constantly moving, the moon is completely still, frozen in time

23
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:17,360
to create a perfectly preserved record of what happened at the birth of the solar system.

24
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,560
Here's astronomer Dr. Becky Smithhurst explaining more to BBC Radio 4 programme Inside Science.

25
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,760
Whereas on the moon, it's just this inert rock. There's no atmosphere. So every single

26
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,560
thing that's happened to the moon in its four and a half billion years worth of history

27
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:42,840
is still recorded there on it. So if anyone's ever seen an image of the far side of the moon,

28
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,360
the side of the moon that we cannot see from Earth is incredibly pop-up. There are

29
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,560
craters all over that thing. And so this is a really big deal when we're thinking about

30
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,599
what happened to the early Earth as well, because we think all of the Earth's water came

31
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,960
from impacts with comets and asteroids in the very early days of the solar system.

32
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:11,039
The rock which makes up the moon is inert. It doesn't move. It's also full of craters,

33
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:16,079
which holes in the ground caused by something hitting it. The moon has so many of these

34
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:22,680
craters, it's described as pockmarked, having a surface that's covered in small marks and scars.

35
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,639
These craters play an important part in the story. Because the moon's surface does not

36
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:34,079
change, finding water there would explain a lot about how water and therefore life started

37
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:40,319
on Earth. That's why Dr. Smithhurst calls the moon mission a big deal, meaning important

38
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:46,359
or significant. That's right. Astronomers know that comets are full of ice and think

39
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:51,799
comets brought water to Earth when they crashed into it. Evidence of those crashes has been

40
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:57,680
erased by the constantly moving surfaces on Earth, but not on the moon. So comparing

41
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,079
water from the moon with water on Earth could provide scientists with vital information

42
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:07,560
as Dr. Smithhurst explained to BBC Radio 4's Inside Science.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,520
Yeah, so they'll be looking essentially to see if it has the same characteristics as water

44
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,199
here on Earth. And then we can sort of trace that back from sort of the crater history as

45
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,639
well to working out what actually happened, how long has it been there for as well? Also

46
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,560
various other minerals that might be there, these very heavy minerals that we know come

47
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,920
from comets and asteroids. Again, that'll be this sort of smoking gun to be like, yes,

48
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,840
that's where this water came from. And it's likely that Earth's water came from there as

49
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,840
well.

50
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:39,719
Scientists can trace the existence of water on the moon back to find out what happened

51
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:45,399
on Earth. If you trace something back, you discover the causes of something by investigating

52
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:46,919
how it developed.

53
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:51,759
For this reason, Dr. Smithhurst says finding water on the moon would be finding a smoking

54
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,519
gun, a modern idiom meaning indisputable evidence or proof. We've learned a lot about

55
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,000
the moon, but we still don't know the answer to your question, Neil, who was the third

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,480
Apollo astronaut on that famous first landing in 1969? I said it was Michael Collins, which

57
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:15,040
was the correct answer. Michael Collins never set foot on the moon himself, but afterwards

58
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,439
said the experience of looking back at Earth from the Apollo spacecraft changed his life

59
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,439
forever.

60
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,720
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from our trip to the moon, starting with

61
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:34,160
inert, not moving or unable to move. A crater is a very large hole in the ground.

62
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,320
Pockmarked means marked by small holes and scars. If you say something is a big deal, it's

63
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,160
important or significant in some way. To trace something back means to discover its causes

64
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,400
by examining how it developed.

65
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,280
And finally, the idiom as smoking gun refers to indisputable evidence or conclusive proof

66
00:05:54,279 --> 00:06:00,199
of something. Once again, our six minutes are up. Join us next time for more scintillating

67
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:05,399
science and useful vocabulary here at six minute English. Goodbye for now.

68
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,399
Goodbye.
