00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,240
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,439
And I'm Beth.

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,480
As a society, we're obsessed with our skin.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,320
But the pursuit of perfect skin can make life difficult for people who struggle with skin conditions.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,600
Spots, zits, or pimples.

8
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,240
There are many names for the red inflamed marks which appear on the face and neck,

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,719
but the medical term is acne.

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,160
Acne is a skin condition which can affect anyone.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,760
It often happens between the ages of 14 and 19, but can continue into adulthood.

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,000
There are many types of acne from black heads and white heads to more severe forms of cysts and scarring.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,760
But whatever the type of acne looking different from others can be emotionally damaging,

14
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:59,039
especially during the teenage years when our self-image and physical appearance are changing.

15
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:06,159
In this programme, we'll be hearing from a skin doctor or dermatologist who suffered acne herself.

16
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,840
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary too.

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,920
But first, I have a question for you, Beth.

18
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,759
Mild or moderate acne is very common in teenagers and young adults.

19
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,879
So, according to the UK's National Health Service,

20
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,280
what proportion of people aged 11 to 30 experience some amount of acne?

21
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:34,079
Is it A 75% B 85% or C 95%?

22
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,039
Oh, I'm going to guess that it is C 95%.

23
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:44,159
Okay, Beth will find out if that's the correct answer at the end of the programme.

24
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:49,199
Dr Sharon Crichlo is a dermatologist originally from Barbados,

25
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,920
as someone who grew up with acne, she understands the impact it can have on a person's mental health.

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,000
As she explains here to BBC World Service programme, the conversation.

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,280
Well, we know for sure that it does stand to a rise from puberty onwards, so the biggest cohort

28
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,719
of patients is in the teenage age group. However, a proportion of patients up to 20 or so

29
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:21,120
percent, certainly in females, it will persist well into the 30s, 40s, much longer than people

30
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,400
often give it credit for. And we also know that it has a huge psychological impact,

31
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,120
so even mild to moderate acne because it affects teenagers who are quite emotionally vulnerable,

32
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,599
it affects their friendships, their pair groups, and so it should never really be trivialised.

33
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,879
Acne tends to start during puberty, the stage in people's lives when they develop from a child

34
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,879
into an adult because of changes in their body. Hormone, such as testosterone, which are

35
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,439
released into the body during puberty, often cause acne to appear.

36
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:04,079
Of course, puberty involves emotional as well as physical changes. Acne can be harder to live with

37
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,760
for someone who is emotionally vulnerable, meaning someone who gets their feelings hurt easily.

38
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Acne affects your confidence and how you interact with the world, so it shouldn't be trivialised,

39
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,800
or made to seem less important than it really is. At times, most teenagers are self-conscious

40
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,960
about their looks, and having acne adds to social pressure. Acne is largely genetic,

41
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,240
and the buildup of oil and bacteria in the pores of the skin, which causes spots,

42
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,520
is due to hormones, which are completely natural. Here's Dr Sharon Crichlo again,

43
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,800
telling BBC World Service Program, the conversation, how her own experience with acne

44
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:51,439
led her to help others with the same problem. I didn't have the luxury of being able to see a

45
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,920
dermatologist when I was younger. My family simply couldn't afford it, so I had to get through

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,239
as best I could, and you just tried everything over the counter, etc.

47
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:09,039
I just felt if I could help people with something that has been such a pain of my life,

48
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,560
and having that inside experience as well, so I would often tell my patients,

49
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,360
pretty much anything I recommend to them, I've tried it myself, I can tell them it works.

50
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,839
Growing up, Dr Crichlo didn't have anyone to help her get through acne. If you get

51
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:31,599
through something, you manage to survive a difficult experience or challenging period of life.

52
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:37,119
Instead, she got whatever medicine she could buy without a doctor's prescription,

53
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:40,799
known as over the counter medicines from her local pharmacy.

54
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:48,879
Dr Crichlo calls acne the bane of my life, an idiom meaning the cause of unhappiness or misfortune.

55
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:55,359
But as she grew older and her acne improved, she used her experience to support her patients in the

56
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,080
UK. For most people, acne stops as they grow older, but remember it's completely natural and

57
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,800
you're not alone. Which reminds me of my question, Beth, what proportion of 11 to 30-year-olds get

58
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:17,439
acne to some extent? You said it was 95%, which was the correct answer. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary

59
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,759
we've learned starting with puberty, the stage of life when a person changes from a child to an adult.

60
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,680
Someone who is emotionally vulnerable has their feelings and emotions easily hurt.

61
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,959
The verb to trivialize means to make something seem less important than it really is.

62
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:40,800
If you get through it, you manage to survive a difficult experience or period of life.

63
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,519
Over the counter medicines can be bought in a shop without a doctor's prescription.

64
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:53,120
And finally, the idiom the bane of my life refers to a source of persistent unhappiness or misfortune.

65
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,360
Once again, our six minutes are up. But remember to join us again next time for more trending topics

66
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,079
