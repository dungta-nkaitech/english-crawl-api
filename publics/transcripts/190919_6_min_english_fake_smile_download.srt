00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,919
Hello, this is 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:16,920
And I'm Sam.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,559
It's good to see you again, Sam.

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:19,440
Really?

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,480
Yeah, of course.

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,039
Can't you tell by the way I'm smiling?

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,039
Well, I find it difficult to tell if someone is really smiling

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,719
or if it's a fake smile.

13
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:31,359
Well, that's a coincidence because this programme

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,119
is all about how computers may be able to tell real smiles

15
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,239
from fake smiles better than humans can.

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,799
Before we get into that, though, a question.

17
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,799
The expressions that we can make with our face are controlled by muscles.

18
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,359
How many muscles do we have in our face?

19
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:52,239
Is it a 26, b 43 or c 62?

20
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,599
What do you think, Sam?

21
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:56,480
No idea, but a lot, I'd guess.

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,480
So I'm going with 62.

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,879
OK, well, we'll see if you'll be smiling

24
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,039
or crying later in the programme.

25
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,319
Hassan Ugael is a professor of visual computing

26
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,920
at the University of Bradford.

27
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,920
He's been working on getting computers

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,479
to be able to recognise human emotions

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,399
from the expressions on our face.

30
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,120
Here he is speaking on the BBC Inside Science Radio programme.

31
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,920
How successful does he say they have been?

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,640
We've been working quite a lot on the human emotions

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,239
or the ideas how the facial muscle movement

34
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:30,319
which is reflected on the face,

35
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,039
through obviously computer, through video frames,

36
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:35,280
and trying to understand how these muscle movements

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,000
actually relate to facial expressions

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,599
and then from facial expressions,

39
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,199
trying to understand the emotions or to infer the emotions.

40
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:45,359
And we have been quite successful in doing that.

41
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,879
We have software that can actually look at somebody's face

42
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,439
in real time and then identify the series of emotions

43
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,479
that persons express in real time as well.

44
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,520
So, have they been successful in getting computers

45
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,359
to identify emotions?

46
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,159
Yes, he says they've been quite successful.

47
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,159
And what's interesting is that he says

48
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,920
that the computers can do it in real time.

49
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,480
This means that there's no delay.

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,039
They don't have to stop and analyse the data

51
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,400
or crunch the numbers.

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,360
They can do it as the person is talking.

53
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,040
The system uses video to analyse a person's expressions

54
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,439
and can then infer the emotions.

55
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,400
To infer something means to get an understanding of something

56
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,039
without actually being told directly.

57
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,879
So, you look at available information

58
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,879
and use your understanding and knowledge

59
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,560
to work out the meaning.

60
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,039
It's a bit like being a detective, isn't it?

61
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,079
You look at the clues and infer what happened

62
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,240
even if you don't have all the details.

63
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,400
Yes, and in this case, the computer looks

64
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,560
at how the movement of muscles in the face

65
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,599
or facial muscles show different emotions.

66
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,599
Here's Professor Ugeh again.

67
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,319
We've been working quite a lot on the human emotions

68
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,919
or the idea is how the facial muscle movement

69
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,000
which is reflected on the face

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,719
through obviously computer through video frames

71
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,879
and trying to understand how these muscle movements

72
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,599
actually relate to facial expressions

73
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,199
and then from facial expressions

74
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,799
trying to understand the emotions

75
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:14,879
or to infer the emotions.

76
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,959
And we have been quite successful in doing that.

77
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,479
We have software that can actually look at somebody's face

78
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,039
in real time and then identify the series of emotions

79
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,919
that person is expressing in real time as well.

80
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,959
So, how do the computers know what is a real or a fake smile?

81
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,799
The computers have to learn that first.

82
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,599
Here's Professor Ugeh again talking about how they do that.

83
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,839
We have a data set of real smiles

84
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:43,839
and we have a data set of fake smiles.

85
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:46,159
These real smiles are indeed smiles in a lab.

86
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,000
So, you put somebody on the chair

87
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,560
and then show some funny movies

88
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,280
and we expect the smiles are genuine smiles.

89
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,240
And similarly, we ask them to pretend they're smile

90
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,159
so these are what we call fake smiles.

91
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,439
So, what we do is we throw these into the machine

92
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,199
and then the machine figures out

93
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,680
what are the characteristics of a real smile

94
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,920
and what are the characteristics of a fake smile.

95
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,759
So, how do they get the data that the computers use

96
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:14,400
to see if your smile is fake or genuine,

97
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,160
which is another word which means real?

98
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,520
They induce real smiles in the lab

99
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,520
by showing people funny films.

100
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,360
This means that they make the smiles come naturally.

101
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,520
They assume that the smiles while watching the funny films are genuine.

102
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,000
And then they ask the people to pretend to smile

103
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and the computer programme now has a database of real and fake smiles

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
and is able to figure out which is which.

105
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,080
Figure out means to calculate and come to an answer.

106
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,600
Yes and apparently the system gets it right 90% of the time

107
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,840
which is much higher than we humans can.

108
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,600
Right, well, before we remind ourselves of our vocabulary,

109
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
let's get the answer to the question.

110
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,320
How many muscles do we have in our face?

111
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,800
Is it A, 26, B, 43 or C, 62?

112
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,240
Sam, are you going to be smiling?

113
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,040
What did you say?

114
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,960
Aha, so I thought 62.

115
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,320
Am I smiling, Neil?

116
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,760
Sadly, you are not using different muscles for that sort of sad look.

117
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,640
Actually, the answer is 43.

118
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:17,199
Congratulations to anyone who got that right.

119
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,639
Now our vocabulary.

120
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,560
Yes, so facial is the adjective relating to face.

121
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,399
Then we had infer.

122
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,039
This verb means to understand something even when you don't have all the information

123
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,560
and you come to this understanding based on your experience and knowledge

124
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,039
or in the case of a computer, the programming.

125
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,919
And these computers work in real time which means that there's no delay

126
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,360
and they can tell a fake smile from a genuine one,

127
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,080
which means a real one, as the person is speaking.

128
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,120
They made people smile or, as the professor said,

129
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,400
they induced smiles by showing funny films.

130
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,560
And the computer is able to figure out or calculate whether the smile is fake or genuine.

131
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,840
Okay, thank you, Sam.

132
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,600
That's all from six minute English today.

Bye-bye.
