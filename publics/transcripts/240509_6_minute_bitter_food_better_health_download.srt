00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:12,560
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Phil.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:18,600
And I'm Beth. Phil, I'm going to start this episode with grapefruit. I've got some here.

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,719
Do you want some? I'm not that keen on grapefruit. They're too bitter for me.

5
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:32,439
Oh, that's a shame because this episode is all about bitter food. It has actually been linked to a number of health benefits.

6
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:42,719
So maybe you should take my grapefruit. I might not like it that much, but in this programme we'll be finding out how bitter foods can benefit our health.

7
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,039
And of course, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary.

8
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:50,439
That should give you a taste of what's coming up, but before that,

9
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:57,000
if you want to learn vocabulary to talk about world events, search for our news review podcast.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,479
We look at vocabulary about a major news story every week.

11
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,680
But back to this episode, I have a question for you Phil.

12
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:16,799
How many different basic flavours can humans taste? Is it A, 4, B, 5 or C, 6?

13
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:26,719
Mmm, I can think of bitter, sweet, salty and sour. So I'm going to go with 4. I think we can taste 4 basic flavours.

14
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,719
Okay, Phil. I'll reveal the correct answer later.

15
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:36,359
Layla Kazim presents the food programme on BBC Radio 4.

16
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:41,159
Here she is talking about some of the possible benefits of bitter food.

17
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,439
New research has found a remarkable link between bitter foods and our health.

18
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,319
It seems they have an incredible ability to interact with our gut microbiome,

19
00:01:53,319 --> 00:02:02,439
suppress feelings of hunger, control glucose release and even counter-cronic inflammation in the body.

20
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:07,079
Could bitter be the answer at the tip of our taste buds?

21
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,039
Bitter foods can interact with our gut microbiome.

22
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:18,599
A microbiome is a collection of microorganisms that can be found in a particular part of the body.

23
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,960
It includes fungi, bacteria and viruses.

24
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,800
Micro organisms in our gut play an important role in the digestive process.

25
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,479
They are our gut microbiome.

26
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,439
If we suppress something, that we stop it from happening or operating,

27
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:40,399
we heard that bitter foods can suppress hunger feelings.

28
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:43,439
This means that they stop people feeling hungry.

29
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,799
If we try to suppress a feeling, we're trying to stop it.

30
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:53,399
Layla asks if bitter foods are the answer at the tip of our taste buds.

31
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:59,039
Normally we'd say that something we can't quite remember is on the tip of our tongue.

32
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:04,679
Here we have taste buds which are the receptors on our tongue and inside our mouths

33
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:07,840
that can detect flavours like bitterness.

34
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,799
So it seems that bitter foods could be very beneficial,

35
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:15,239
but they're not always the easiest food to love.

36
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,199
In BBC Radio 4's The Food Program,

37
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:22,280
presenter Layla Kazim spoke to Chef Alexander Anatoli,

38
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,879
who points out that we might be consuming more bitter food than we realise.

39
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:30,039
I think it's a real perception issue with it.

40
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:34,159
I think people are exposed to bitterness way more than they think they are.

41
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,799
But there's this perception of bitter and negativity.

42
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:40,240
Both in terms of emotions and food, right?

43
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,840
Bitterness is generally an undesirable trait.

44
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,840
But there are so many very, very mainstream bitter things.

45
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,000
Such as chocolate, coffee, alcohol,

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,680
any alcohol has a degree of bitterness to it.

47
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:00,280
Alexander says that many people see bitterness as an undesirable trait.

48
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,400
A trait is a characteristic,

49
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,240
so an undesirable trait is a characteristic that people don't want.

50
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,480
We often see bitterness as a bad thing.

51
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,040
We also often use undesirable traits

52
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,879
to refer to negative aspects of people's personalities.

53
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:23,959
Alexander points out that there are a number of mainstream things

54
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:25,759
that have a bit of flavour.

55
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,959
If something is mainstream,

56
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:32,120
then it means it's ordinary and part of what most people consume.

57
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,519
She listed chocolate and coffee as mainstream things.

58
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,000
The other mainstream thing mentioned was alcohol.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,519
We heard that it has a degree of bitterness.

60
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:45,079
If something has a degree of something,

61
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:50,439
then it has at least a small, but noticeable, amount of it.

62
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:54,680
OK, now I think it's time to hear the answer to your question.

63
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,879
Right, I asked how many basic flavours humans can taste?

64
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:02,039
And I guessed it was four.

65
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:05,639
Which, unfortunately, was not the right answer.

66
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,959
The answer is, in fact, five.

67
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,919
The flavour that you missed is umami,

68
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,879
which comes from a Japanese word

69
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,040
and refers to a savoury flavour

70
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,480
often found in grilled meats or broths.

71
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,519
OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt.

72
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,959
Starting with microbiome,

73
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:28,399
the collection of microorganisms found in a specific part of the body.

74
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,279
Suppress means prevent from operating or happening.

75
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:34,800
Taste buds are the receptors found on the tongue

76
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,519
and in the mouth that sense flavours.

77
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,839
An undesirable trait is a negative characteristic that we don't want.

78
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,479
If something is mainstream,

79
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,079
then it's something that most people would use.

80
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,679
It's not unusual.

81
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:52,279
And finally, a degree of something is a small,

82
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:54,679
but noticeable amount of something.

83
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:57,239
Once again, our six minutes are up.

84
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:59,399

for more topical discussion and useful vocabulary here at 6 Minute English.

86
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:05,879
Goodbye for now.

87
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,879
Bye.
