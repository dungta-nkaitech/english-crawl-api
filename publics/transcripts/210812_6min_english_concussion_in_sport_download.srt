6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish.com

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And I'm Georgina.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
When it comes to sport, there's something for everyone.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Do you play as sport Georgina?

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I used to play in a netball team years ago.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Now I go jogging and I enjoy swimming too.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yes, I go jogging sometimes and I play football, although I'm no Ronaldo.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But some sports, the so-called full-contact sports like rugby, American football and boxing,

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
are much more dangerous.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Now the truth about the long-term effects on players who make a career

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
taking heavy tackles or punches to the head is being slowly revealed.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And the issue of safety and sport was back in the news again recently

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
when Danish footballer Christian Erickson collapsed on the pitch

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
during the 2020 European Football Championship.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
At the centre of the debate, I'll worry about possible brain damage

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and dementia caused by concussion.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That's a type of traumatic brain injury caused by a bump or blow to the head

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and the topic of this programme.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Boxing, of course, is one of the most dangerous sports.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And so my quiz question is about a famous boxer.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Born in 1949, this boxer has remained mentally and physically fit

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
despite years of punishment in the boxing ring.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But who am I talking about?

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Is he A. Muhammad Ali, B. George Foreman or C. Mike Tyson?

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm not a big boxing fan now, but I'll say B. George Foreman.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay, Georgina, we'll find out the answer to that question later in the programme.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So far, we've been talking about heavy full-contact sports like boxing.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But the truth is that any sportsperson can get concussed.

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
In 2018, hockey player and Olympic gold medalist Nikola White

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
was involved in a heavy collision with another player during a warm-up match.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Here's Nikola telling her story to Paul Connelly,

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
a presenter of the BBC World Service programme The Inquiry.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I started suffering headaches, nausea,

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
light sensitivity, noise sensitivity.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
My balance was off. I just felt terrible.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I always used to describe it like I was in an Alice in Wonderland.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I just felt in such a warped world.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It just felt relentless and it never stopped.

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Three years on from that moment of impact,

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Nikola is still picking up the pieces.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Despite seeking advice and treatment from specialists in the field of Hed trauma,

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
many of her symptoms persist.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
After the collision, Nikola's balance was off.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
When something is off, it's worse than usual.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And off can also mean bad, as in this milk smells awful. It's gone off.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Nikola felt terrible and her world was warped, strange and unpleasant.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
In fact, three years after the accident, she was still picking up the pieces,

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
trying to return to normality after a crisis or collapse.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Concussion is a problem in many sports,

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
even those like hockey or athletics that are not considered full contact.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But the dangers involved with boxing are far greater.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
In fact, it's one of the few sports that has concussion written into the rules.

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes, that's right. When a boxer is knocked down, he has ten seconds to stand up

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and get his senses together.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
If he can't, there's a good chance he's concussed.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Tristixson is a former boxer-turned sports writer.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Here he is speaking to BBC World Service programme The Inquiry

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
about concussion in boxing.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
See if you can spot the answer to the quiz question near last earlier.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
When you look back through history and you see that Henry Armstrong, Sugar Ray,

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Robinson, Muhammad Ali, Joe Lewis all suffered with neurological problems as they got older.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But what we also need to find out is why can you have a fight like George Foreman,

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
who's now in his 70s and has bright as a button after too long hard careers?

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Why do some people seem to have a reserve that has kept them safe later in life?

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Tristix mentions some famous boxers who suffered neurological problems in later life

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and another boxer who's still as bright as a button.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
An expression used to describe someone who's happy, cheerful, intelligent and full of energy.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It seems that some people have a reserve, a supply of energy they keep stored up for use in the future when it's needed.

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay, Georgina, let's get back to my quiz question and I'm pretty sure you know the answer now.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes, I think so.

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Neil asked me which famous boxer, born in 1949, was still mentally alert despite many years of fighting.

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I guess it was B, George Foreman.

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
A good listening Georgina.

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Thanks Neil, looks like I'm as bright as a button today.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Let's recap the vocabulary from this programme about concussion,

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
a traumatic brain injury caused by a knock to the head.

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
When something is off, it's bad or worse than usual.

87
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The adjective warped means strange and unpleasant.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
To pick up the pieces means to try to return to the way things were before a crisis or collapse.

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
A reserve is a supply of something that you kept back until it's needed.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And finally, someone who's as bright as a button is very happy and cheerful, intelligent and full of energy.

91
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Sounds like our six minute English listeners to me.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's all for our investigation into concussion in sport,

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,000
but if you'd like to find out more about the subject, you can listen again to the whole programme on the BBC World Service website.

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And if you want to grow your brain power, not get linguistically concussed,

95
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
why not join us again soon for more topical discussion and useful vocabulary here at six minute English from BBC Learning English?

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Bye for now.

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Bye!
