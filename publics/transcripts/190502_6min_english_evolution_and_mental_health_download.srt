00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,120
Hello, this is 6Nate English, I'm Rob.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,320
And I'm Neil.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,800
Do you ever experience anxiety, Neil?

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,320
Anxiety?

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,960
Yes, you know, a feeling of being really worried or nervous without any real reason.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,760
Well, not really, but I know for some people it can be quite a serious problem.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,679
Well, anxiety may be a result of natural selection.

12
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,039
Natural selection, you mean the principle behind evolution?

13
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:43,439
Yes, the idea that life on this planet has developed as a result of random changes in biology

14
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:45,120
over many, many years.

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,120
So why have anxiety?

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,040
That seems like a negative rather than a positive thing to develop.

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,600
Well, we'll find out more in this programme.

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,200
But before we do, a quiz.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,720
Charles Darwin is famous for describing evolution by natural selection.

20
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,320
What was the name of the ship he travelled on when he made his discoveries?

21
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:11,359
Was it a HMS Beagle, B HMS Badger, or C HMS Bear?

22
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:12,320
What do you think, Neil?

23
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,840
Well, I'm pretty sure I know this one, so I'm not going to give away the answer just yet.

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,600
Well, you can let me know at the end of the programme before I give the answer.

25
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:26,479
Right, Dr Randolph Nessie is a doctor and psychologist.

26
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,799
He's written a lot about how evolution has an impact on our mental condition,

27
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,319
particularly anxiety.

28
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,759
Recently, he spoke on BBC Radio 4's Start the Week programme about this topic.

29
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,639
Listen out for the answer to this question.

30
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:44,319
How long did he treat patients at the University of Michigan for?

31
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,799
Natural selection has shaped all organisms to have special states

32
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,280
to cope with certain kinds of circumstances.

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,519
I treated patients with anxiety disorders for 40 years at the University of Michigan.

34
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,920
It was only halfway through that I started to realise that anxiety is there for a good reason.

35
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,079
So, Neil, how long did he treat patients for at the University of Michigan?

36
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:14,400
He says that he did that for 40 years, but it was only after about 20 years or so that he realised

37
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,120
that we suffer from anxiety for a good reason.

38
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,120
We'll find out that reason shortly, but first he said that natural selection has shaped

39
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,840
all organisms. This means that we are the result of natural selection.

40
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,920
It has made us what we are.

41
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,319
And it has made us able to cope with different situations.

42
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,599
To cope with means being able to deal with, being able to manage a difficult situation.

43
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,640
And anxiety, if it's not too great, is a way of dealing with particular situations.

44
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,959
Let's hear from Dr. Nessie again.

45
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,679
Natural selection has shaped all organisms to have special states to cope with certain kinds

46
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:59,279
of circumstances. I treated patients with anxiety disorders for 40 years at the University of Michigan.

47
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:03,599
It was only halfway through that I started to realise that anxiety is there for a good reason.

48
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:12,319
So, why is anxiety a necessary thing? Why is it something that, within reason, is not a bad emotion?

49
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,840
Here's Dr. Nessie talking about his patients who suffer from too much anxiety.

50
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,479
What you're having is a normal kind of emergency response, which is great in life-threatening

51
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,039
situations, but for you it's a false alarm like a smoke detector going off when you burn the

52
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:35,120
toast. And after that, many of my patients said, oh, that makes perfect sense. I think I won't need

53
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:42,319
you to help after all, Dr. So, what is anxiety? Well, it's your body reacting to danger,

54
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:48,480
like an emergency response, a warning. In really dangerous situations, which could harm you or even

55
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,719
kill you, which Dr. Nessie describes as life-threatening situations, it's a useful response to warn you

56
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:00,960
to take action or to prepare for action. But some people experience anxiety when there's no real

57
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,960
danger. It's a false alarm, like when you burn the toast and the smoke detector alarm starts,

58
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:13,040
or as he says goes off. And he says that some patients can feel less worried after that when

59
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,920
they realize anxiety is a natural thing. Let's hear from Dr. Nessie again.

60
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,720
What you're having is a normal kind of emergency response, which is great in life-threatening

61
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,199
situations, but for you it's a false alarm like a smoke detector going off when you burn the

62
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:35,199
toast. And after that, many of my patients said, oh, that makes perfect sense. I think I won't

63
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:42,159
need you to help after all, Dr. Time now to review today's vocabulary. But first, let's have the

64
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:47,759
answer to the quiz question. What was the name of the ship Charles Darwin traveled on when he made

65
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:56,159
his discoveries about evolution? Was it a HMS Beagle, b HMS Badger, or c HMS Bear? What did you think,

66
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:04,400
Neil? Well, I'm pretty sure it's HMS Beagle. Well, you are right. Charles Darwin traveled on HMS Beagle.

67
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:11,520
Congratulations if you also knew that. Now on with today's vocabulary, we were talking about anxiety,

68
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,080
a feeling of being worried or scared, a feeling that something isn't quite right.

69
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,000
Dr. Nessie suggests that anxiety is a result of natural selection. This is the principle of

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,759
evolution whereby random changes in the biology of a living thing can make it more likely to survive

71
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,600
in a particular environment. These changes shape the living thing. They make it what it is.

72
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,519
They help it to cope with different situations, which means they help it manage or deal with those

73
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:45,360
situations. A life threatening situation is a very dangerous situation which could cause serious

74
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,680
injury or even death. And finally, there was the phrasal verb to go off. For example, if an alarm

75
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,199
goes off, it means that it starts making a loud noise as a warning. Right before any alarm

76
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,560
starts to go off here, we need to wrap up. That's all from us today. Do join us again next time.

77
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,639
Until then, you can find us online on social media and on our app. Look out for BBC Learning

78
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,519
English. Bye for now. Goodbye.
