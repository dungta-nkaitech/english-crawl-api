5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,960
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,839
I'm Neil.

7
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:18,960
And I'm Rob.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,839
Fancy a game of food connections, Rob.

9
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,920
So I'll name a place and you say the first food that comes to mind.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,560
Ready?

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,080
Yeah, sure, let's go.

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,879
Italy.

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,399
Pizza or Lissagna.

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,280
New York?

15
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,799
Hot dogs, of course, or maybe bagels.

16
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,239
Now, how about Cornwall from the UK?

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,039
Oh, right. If it's Cornwall, it must be the famous Cornish Pasty, right?

18
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,000
That's right.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,920
Cornwall, the region which forms the southwestern tip of Britain,

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,599
is as famous for its pasties as New Yorkers for hot dogs.

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,239
In this programme, we'll be finding out all about Cornish pasties

22
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,800
and we'll hear how it's gone from humble beginnings

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,359
to become a symbol of Cornish identity

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,200
and spread around the world to Jamaica, Argentina and Brazil.

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,960
But what exactly is a pasty, Neil?

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,400
Somewhere between a pie and a sandwich, right?

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,320
A piece of pastry which is turned over and crimped along the side

28
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,840
to make two corners.

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,000
And filled with different ingredients,

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,960
which brings me to my quiz question for today, Rob.

31
00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:29,679
What is the traditional filling in an authentic Cornish Pasty?

32
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:36,399
Is it a chicken avocado and bry, b, beef potato and turnip,

33
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:39,679
or c, pork, onion and chorizo?

34
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,199
Well, chorizo is Spanish, isn't it?

35
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:46,959
An avocado with bry doesn't sound traditionally Cornish,

36
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,839
so I'll say b, beef potato and turnip.

37
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,199
Okay, Rob, we'll find out later if you were right.

38
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,120
What's for sure is that the Cornish Pasty has had a long history

39
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,159
as BBC Radio 4's The Food Programme discovered.

40
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,840
They spoke to Dr. Polly Russell, a public life curator at the British Library.

41
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,599
Here she is reading from one of the earliest mentions of pasties

42
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,599
from the late 17th century.

43
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,120
There's a lovely bit here where he's describing

44
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,840
what a housewife in Hertfordshire does,

45
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,719
and he's talking about her way to make pork pies and pork pasties.

46
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,560
Pies may be made and baked, either raised in paste,

47
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,240
earth and pans or imputed dishes, or in the shape of a turnover,

48
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,319
two-corned pasties.

49
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,920
So that's a very early reference to a pastie in the shape,

50
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,560
I think, that we know it, but also being made specifically for laborers

51
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,000
to be feeding laborers on a farm at harvest time.

52
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,479
So the earliest pasties were made in pewter dishes,

53
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,599
a traditional cooking plate made of a silver coloured metal called pewter.

54
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,759
And they were eaten by agricultural laborers, workers doing physical farmwork during harvest time,

55
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,159
the weeks in autumn when crops like wheat are cut and collected from the fields.

56
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,319
But it wasn't only farmers and laborers who ate pasties.

57
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,039
As well as its farms and fishing,

58
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:19,120
Cornel was famous for tin mines, as Ruth Huxley of the Cornish Pasties Association explains.

59
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,919
Pasties would have been eaten by lots of people who went to work,

60
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:27,120
but it just worked perfectly down mines and Cornel became the world capital of mining.

61
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,840
And so lots of pasties were made, lots of pasties were eaten,

62
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,439
and then that mining community went all over the world and took the pasties with them.

63
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:38,879
Pasties were eaten by hungry workers involved in the mining industry,

64
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,560
digging up materials such as coal or metals like gold or in Cornwall tin from the ground.

65
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,120
So far we've been talking about Cornel, but you said the Cornish pastie has spread around the

66
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,560
world, Neil. How did that happen? Well, that's connected to the tin miners we just talked about.

67
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:04,240
Here's Pauli Russell again. This is replicated not just in Mexico, but with migrants moving to

68
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,920
America, to Minnesota, to Canada, to Australia. So anyone who travels to many of those places now

69
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,240
will see foods which are incredibly reminiscent and familiar and just like Cornish pasties.

70
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:22,400
In the 19th century, many Cornish tin miners emigrated moving abroad to start a better life.

71
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,560
Their pasties recipes were replicated or copied exactly in the new places where they landed

72
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,439
from America to Australia. And that's why in many places around the world, you can find food which

73
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:39,279
is reminiscent of pasties, meaning it reminds you of something similar. In this case, the original

74
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,639
Cornish pastie with its traditional filling of, what was your quiz question again, Neil?

75
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,279
Ah, yes. I asked you what the traditional Cornish pastie filling was. You said.

76
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:55,759
I said B, beef potato and turnip. And you were right. Kess Lawena Robb,

77
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,839
that's Cornish for congratulations. Heb Grev, Neil, that's no problem.

78
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:07,039
In fact, those other fillings, Churrisso, avocado and bry, really did feature in pasties

79
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,679
entered for this year's annual world pastie championships held in Cornwall every spring.

80
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:19,359
Other pastie inspired ideas include Argentinian, Chimichuri and Panadas and spicy Jamaican patties.

81
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:24,479
So the pastie is still going strong both in Cornwall and around the world.

82
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,839
Today we've been discussing Cornish pasties, a kind of filled pastry from the southwest of England,

83
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:36,719
originally made in pewter dishes, that's a silver-colored metal dish. Pasties were eaten by agricultural

84
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:42,319
labourers, farm workers bringing in the autumn harvest, the time when crops are cut and collected

85
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:48,159
from the fields, and also by workers in the tin mining industry, digging up metals like tin

86
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,079
from underground. Later, when these miners emigrated to new lands, pasties were replicated,

87
00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:00,959
cooked again in the same way. In fact, Cornish miners moved to so many new countries that today,

88
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:06,879
almost every corner of the world has food reminiscent of or reminding you of the original Cornish

89
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:12,399
pastie. That's all for today. Join us again soon for more topical discussion and vocabulary on

00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,639
