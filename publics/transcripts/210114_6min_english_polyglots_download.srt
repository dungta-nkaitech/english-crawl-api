Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Neil.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,080
And I'm Rob.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,280
Bonjour, Rob.

6
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:21,920
Excuse me.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,320
Oh, okay. I think Neil's saying hello in different languages.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,359
French was it and then Japanese.

9
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,960
And Spanish, is that right?

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,480
Seem we'll be in.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,880
The English are famously slow to learn other languages,

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,280
but it seems that Rob and I, and of course you,

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,079
our global audience here at 6 Minute English,

14
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,960
are good examples of polyglots, people who speak more than one language,

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,280
sometimes known as super linguists,

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,439
people who speak multiple languages benefit from many advantages,

17
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,600
as we'll be hearing in this programme.

18
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,240
That word polyglot sounds familiar, Neil,

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,359
doesn't the prefix poly mean many?

20
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,960
That's right, like polygon, a shape with many sides.

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,719
Or polymath, someone who knows many things.

22
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,400
And speaking of knowing things, it's time for my quiz question.

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,400
The word polyglot comes from Greek and is made up of two parts,

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,159
poly, which as Rob says means many, and glut.

25
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,840
But what does glut mean?

26
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,640
What is the meaning of the word polyglot?

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,959
Is it A? Many words?

28
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,680
B? Many sounds or C? Many tongues.

29
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,599
Well, there's three syllables in polyglot, Neil,

30
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,400
so I reckon it's B. Many sounds.

31
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,719
Okay, Rob will find out if that's right at the end of the programme.

32
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,519
But leaving aside the origins of the word,

33
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,400
what exactly does being a polyglot involve?

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,439
British-born polyglot Richard Simcott speaks 11 languages.

35
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,319
Listen to his definition as he speaks to BBC World Service programme, the documentary.

36
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,519
A polyglot, for me, can be anyone who identifies with that term.

37
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,840
It's somebody who learns languages that they don't necessarily need for their lives,

38
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,280
but just out of sheer enjoyment, pleasure, or fascination with another language or culture.

39
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,280
For Richard, being a polyglot simply means identifying with the idea,

40
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,879
feeling that you are similar or closely connected to it.

41
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,319
He says polyglots learn languages not because they have to,

42
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,039
but for the sheer enjoyment, which means nothing except enjoyment.

43
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:36,639
Richard uses the word sheer to emphasise how strong and pure this enjoyment is.

44
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,159
As well as the pleasure of speaking other languages,

45
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,439
polyglots are also better at communicating with others.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,560
My favourite quote by South Africa's first black president Nelson Mandela is,

47
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:54,240
if you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.

48
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,920
If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.

49
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,199
How inspiring, Rob. I'm lost for words.

50
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,560
Here's another.

51
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,840
To have another language is to possess a second soul.

52
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,199
So language learning is good for the head, heart and soul, a person's spirit,

53
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,039
or the part of them, which is believed to continue existing after death.

54
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,280
Yes, and what's more, language learning is good for the brain too.

55
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,759
That's according to Harvard neuroscientist, Eve Federenko.

56
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,479
She's researched the effects of speaking multiple languages on the brains of growing children.

57
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,399
Eve predicted that multilingual children would have hyperactive language brains.

58
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:42,239
But what she actually found surprised her, as she explains here to BBC World Services,

59
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,199
the documentary.

60
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,199
What we found, this is now people who already have proficiency in multiple languages,

61
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,199
what we found is that their language regions appear to be smaller.

62
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,199
And that was surprising.

63
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,119
And as people get better and better and more automatic at performing the task,

64
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:02,239
the activations shrink, so to speak, over time.

65
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,839
So they become, it becomes so that you don't have to use as much brain tissue to do the task as well.

66
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:09,280
Right, so you become more efficient.

67
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,719
And Eve was testing children who already have language proficiency,

68
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:18,079
the skill and ability to do something, such as speak a language.

69
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,480
Her surprising discovery was that the language regions of these children's brains were shrinking,

70
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,319
not because their speaking skills were getting worse, but the opposite.

71
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,600
As they learned and repeated language patterns, their brain tissue became more efficient,

72
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,439
worked quicker and more effectively.

73
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,879
It suggested that this increased efficiency is a result of exposure to different languages.

74
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:43,120
So that proves it, Neil.

75
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,680
Speaking many languages is good for the head, heart, mind and soul.

76
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,480
You took the words right out of my mouth.

77
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,639
And speaking of words, what does the glot in polyglot actually mean?

78
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,680
Was my answer correct?

79
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,759
Ah, that's right.

80
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,319
In my quiz question, I asked you for the meaning of the word polyglot.

81
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,480
And I said B, many sounds.

82
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,319
But in fact, the correct answer was C, many tongues.

83
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,959
You may be a polyglot, Rob, that you're not quite a polymath yet.

84
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:20,159
Okay, well, let me get my brain tissues working by recapping the vocabulary,

85
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:24,319
starting with polyglot, someone who speaks many languages.

86
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,759
The language centres in a polyglot's brain are efficient.

87
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,199
They work quickly and effectively in an organised way.

88
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,120
Proficiency means the skill and ability to do something well.

89
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,439
And if you identify with something, you feel that you are similar or closely connected to it.

90
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,800
Polyglot's learn languages for the sheer enjoyment of it.

91
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,759
A word meaning nothing except which is used to emphasise the strength of feeling.

92
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:56,319
So speaking many languages is good for mind and soul, a person's non-physical spirit,

93
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,959
which some believe to continue after death.

94
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,399
That's it for this programme, but to discover more about language learning,

95
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,879
including some useful practical tips, check out the SuperLinguist series

96
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:09,199
from BBC World Services, the documentary.

97
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,799
Bye for now, bye!
