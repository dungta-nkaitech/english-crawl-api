00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,759
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Phil.

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,040
And I'm Georgie.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,600
Animal testing is when living animals are used in scientific research

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,640
to find out how effective a new medicine is

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,600
or how safe a product is for humans.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,359
Scientists in favour of it argue that animal testing shows

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,879
whether medicines are safe or dangerous for humans

9
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:32,799
and has saved many lives.

10
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:37,439
But animal rights campaigners say it's cruel and also ineffective

11
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,560
because animals and humans are so different.

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,560
Under British law, medicines must be tested on two different types of animals,

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,879
usually starting with rats, mice or guinea pigs.

14
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,960
And in everyday English, the term human guinea pig

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,359
can be used to mean the first people to have something tested on them.

16
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,560
But now groups both for and against animal testing are thinking again

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,359
thanks to a recent development in the debate.

18
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,159
AI

19
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,519
In this programme we'll be hearing how artificial intelligence

20
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,599
could help reduce the need for scientific testing on animals.

21
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,120
But first, I have a question for you Georgie.

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,079
There's one commonly used medicine in particular,

23
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,359
which is harmful for animals but safe for humans.

24
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:26,959
But what?

25
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:36,239
Is it A, antibiotics, B, aspirin or C, parasitamol?

26
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,359
Mmm, I guess it's aspirin.

27
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,599
Okay Georgie, I'll reveal the answer at the end of the programme.

28
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:48,480
Christine Roe is a science journalist who's interested in the animal testing debate.

29
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,719
Here she explains to BBC World Service programme,

30
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,600
TechLife, some of the limitations of testing medicines on animals.

31
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Of course, you can't necessarily predict from a mouse or a dog what's going to happen in a human.

32
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,880
And there have been a number of cases where substances that have proven to be toxic

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,560
in animals have been proven to be safe in humans and vice versa.

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,520
There are also, of course, animal welfare limitations to animal testing.

35
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,760
Most people, I think, if they had the choice would want their substances to be used on as few

36
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,280
animals or no animals as possible while still ensuring safety.

37
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,200
Now that's been a really difficult needle to thread, but AI might help to make that what possible.

38
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,719
Christine says that medicines which are safe for animals might not be safe for humans,

39
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,960
but the opposite is also true.

40
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,920
What's safe for humans might not be safe for animals.

41
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:48,719
Christine uses the phrase vice versa to show that the opposite of what she says is also true.

42
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:56,639
Christine also uses the idiom to thread the needle, to describe a task which requires a lot of skill

43
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,039
and precision, especially one involving a conflict.

44
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:07,919
Yes, medical animal testing may save human lives, but many people see it as cruel and

45
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,000
distressing for the animal. It's a difficult needle to thread.

46
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:17,519
But now the challenge of threading that needle has got a little easier because of artificial

47
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,839
intelligence, predicting how likely a new medicine is to harm humans involves analyzing the

48
00:03:23,839 --> 00:03:30,399
results of thousands of experiments, and one thing AI is really good at is analyzing mountains

49
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:37,439
and mountains of data. Here's Christine Roe again speaking with BBC World Services Tech Life.

50
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,079
So AI isn't the whole picture, of course, but it's an increasingly important part of the picture.

51
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,359
And one reason for that is that there is a huge amount of toxicology data to wade through

52
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:52,319
when it comes to determining and chemical safety. And on top of that, there's the staggering

53
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,120
number of chemicals being invented all of the time.

54
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,199
AI helps scientists wade through huge amounts of data.

55
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:06,000
If you wade through something, you spend a lot of time and effort doing something boring or

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,080
difficult, especially reading a lot of information.

57
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:17,120
AI can process huge amounts of data and what's more, that amount keeps growing as new chemicals

58
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,519
are invented. Christine uses the phrase on top of that, meaning in addition to something.

59
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:29,600
Often this extra thing is negative. She means there's already so much data to understand,

60
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,160
and additionally there's even more to be understood about these new chemicals.

61
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,560
Of course, the good news is that with AI, testing on animals could one day stop.

62
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,640
Although Christine warns that AI is not the whole picture, it's not a complete description

63
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,520
of something which includes all the relevant information.

64
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,720
Nevertheless, the news is a step forward for both animal welfare and for modern medicine.

65
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,040
Speaking of which, what was the answer to your question Phil?

66
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,480
What is a commonly used medicine which is safe for humans but harmful to animals?

67
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:14,480
I guess it was aspirin. Which was the correct answer. Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've

68
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,320
discussed starting with human guinea pigs, meaning the first people to have something

69
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,160
new tested on them. The phrase vice versa is used to indicate that the opposite of what you

70
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:34,080
have just said is also true. To thread the needle describes a task which requires extreme skill and

71
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,640
precision to do successfully. The whole picture means a complete description of something which

72
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:47,120
includes all the relevant information and opinions about it. If you wade through something,

73
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,520
you spend a lot of time and effort doing something boring or difficult, especially reading a lot

74
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,839
of information. And finally, the phrase on top of something means in addition to something

75
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:05,599
and that extra thing is often negative. That's all for this week. Goodbye for now. Bye!
