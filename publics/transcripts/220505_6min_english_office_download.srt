4
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,600
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,839
And I'm Neil. Have you seen my pen, Sam? It's not on my desk.

6
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,400
No, I haven't touched your pen, Neil.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,679
And someone's taken my coffee mug too.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,439
Ever since we started hot-desking, people in this office think they can do whatever they like.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,159
Neil doesn't like the new rule about office hot-desking.

10
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,600
The system where workers don't have their own personal desk,

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,719
but use any available desk on a temporary basis.

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,039
Maybe he should look for another job and quit the 9-5.

13
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,840
A phrase describing jobs which start at 9am and end at 5pm.

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,359
The normal hours that people in offices work from Monday to Friday.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,679
Maybe I should quit. I loved working from home during the pandemic,

16
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,079
no early mornings, no crowded trains, and no one using my pens.

17
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:11,280
As the Covid pandemic slows down, more and more people are returning to work in the office.

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,120
In this programme, we take a look at life in the modern office.

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,319
And of course, we'll learn some useful vocabulary as well.

20
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,960
But first, I have a question for you, Sam.

21
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,519
As you know, I am not an office lover.

22
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,640
Besides disappearing pens, workers have plenty of other complaints about office life.

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,759
From co-workers who never do the washing up to fighting over spaces in the car park.

24
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,000
But according to a 2021 survey by Metro newspaper,

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,560
what did British workers vote the worst thing about working in an office?

26
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,199
Was it A, printers not working?

27
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:52,319
B, people speaking too loudly, or C, co-workers leaving empty milk cartons in the fridge?

28
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,000
I see stealing pens isn't on the list.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,879
So I'll say A, printers not working.

30
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,319
That really makes me mad.

31
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,759
Okay, Sam. I'll reveal the correct answer later in the programme.

32
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:11,120
Nowadays, most modern offices are open plan, large spaces without internal walls dividing them up.

33
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,719
The idea is to create a sense of togetherness,

34
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,519
but many employees prefer having their own space,

35
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,680
and use all types of objects to mark out their personal territory.

36
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,079
These could be anything from family photos and holiday souvenirs

37
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:29,519
to homemade cakes and biscuits placed at the end of a desk

38
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:33,039
to allow people to grab a biscuit and start a conversation.

39
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,560
Researcher Harriet Short traveled around Britain interviewing office workers

40
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,439
about the types of objects they use to decorate and mark out their workspace.

41
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:48,159
Here she is, telling BBC Radio 4 programme Thinking Allowed,

42
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,599
about one young woman who stuck photos and postcards

43
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,120
onto strips of cardboard.

44
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,240
She had created this sort of montage on this strip of paper

45
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,879
and would roll it up daily.

46
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,800
She had a little plant as well, and she would take it to whatever desk

47
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:11,439
she was working at and would pin it up to a low-level desk divider.

48
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:17,120
And so there's that sense of however temporarily they might be in a particular space in the office,

49
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,920
they still, there is still evidence in this research

50
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,200
that people want to feel comfort and settled and have some sense of familiarity.

51
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,360
The woman Harriet interviewed used photos and postcards to create a montage,

52
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,120
a piece of work made by putting together several different items,

53
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,520
often in interesting combinations.

54
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:43,120
Her photo montage reminded her of the people and the places she loved outside of work.

55
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,159
For Harriet, this shows that people want workspaces to have a sense of familiarity,

56
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,360
the feeling of knowing something so well that you feel comfortable and relaxed.

57
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,200
Harriet also interviewed hairdressers working in beauty salons

58
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,159
about the marks and stains found in their workplace.

59
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:06,719
Here she tells BBC Radio 4's Thinking Allowed about a strangely shaped mark on the floor of one

60
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,439
hair salon.

61
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,319
A sort of half moon gath mark that goes right round the back of the chair.

62
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,639
So literally she's worn out the floor.

63
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,040
It's exactly where a hairdresser would tread for many, many hours of the day.

64
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,120
And she took the photograph and she showed it to me and she said,

65
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,079
this is me, you know, you want to know about identity and it represents a hard graft.

66
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:36,000
Harriet interviewed a hairdresser whose salon floor had been worn out damaged by continual use

67
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,879
after being walked on again and again as the woman cut people's hair.

68
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:46,800
For her, the worn out floor symbolised hard graft or hard work.

69
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,160
Whatever your job, we all spend most of each day at work,

70
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,839
so it's important to have a workplace that's safe, comfortable and familiar,

71
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,759
where people don't steal your pens.

72
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,160
Oh Neil, you sound like the office workers in that newspaper survey.

73
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,480
Yes, let's return to my question, which was,

74
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,520
according to a 2021 Metro newspaper survey, what is British workers number one complaint

75
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,040
about working in an office?

76
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,600
I guess it was the printers not working.

77
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,560
Was I right?

78
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,319
You were wrong, I'm afraid.

79
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,439
In fact, the top complaint was people speaking too loudly, another of my pet hates.

80
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,400
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from this programme on the 9-5

81
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,960
work which happens during normal Monday to Friday office hours.

82
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,839
Hot Deskying is where office workers do not have their own permanent desk

83
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,159
but use a different desk each day.

84
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:43,519
A montage is made by pushing together different items and interesting combinations.

85
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,599
A sense of familiarity is a feeling of knowing something so well

86
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:50,000
that you feel comfortable and relaxed around it.

87
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,240
When something is worn out from overuse, it's old or damaged.

88
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,199
And finally, hard graft is a slang phrase meaning hard work.

89
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,759
Once more, our six minutes are up.

90
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,479
We hope you'll join us again soon for more trending topics and useful vocabulary

91
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:07,920
here at six minute English.

92
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,279
But that's goodbye for now.

93
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:09,920
Goodbye.
