Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,600
I'm Neil.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,960
And I'm Georgina.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,160
This is the programme where we hope to add some colour to your life

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,640
by talking about an interesting subject

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,440
and teaching you some useful vocabulary.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,080
And colour is what we're talking about today.

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,920
What's your favourite colour, Neil?

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,280
Ooh, I like green, a fresh, bold colour

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,560
that reminds me of nature.

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,640
It can have a calming effect.

15
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:40,160
And you?

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,359
It's got to be blue.

17
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,280
It reminds me of the sea, the sky, and holidays, of course.

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,840
Color, no matter which one we prefer,

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,200
affect how we feel.

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,680
And we'll be talking about that soon.

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,159
But not before I challenge you to answer my quiz question, Georgina,

22
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,599
and it's a science question.

23
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,199
Do you know what the splitting of white light

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,199
into its different colours is called?

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,560
Is it A, dispersion, B, reflection, or C, refraction?

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,000
Mmm, well, I'm not a scientist, so I'll have to guess

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,599
as C, refraction.

28
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,959
Okay, I'll reveal the right answer later on.

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,159
But now, let's talk more about colour.

30
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,599
Colour can represent many different things,

31
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:27,280
depending on where you come from.

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,079
You can be green with envy,

33
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,399
wishing you had what someone else had.

34
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:35,519
And someone can feel blue, so feel depressed.

35
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,239
We choose colours to express ourselves in what we wear

36
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:40,079
or how we decorate our home.

37
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,959
The BBC Radio 4 programme, You and Yours,

38
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:44,640
has been talking about colour,

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,799
and whether it affects everyone's mood.

40
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,400
Karen Huller is a colour psychologist,

41
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,400
and a colour designer and consultant.

42
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,960
She explained how colour affects us.

43
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,480
It's the way that we take in the wavelengths of light,

44
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,719
because colour is wavelengths of light,

45
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,560
and it's how that comes in through our eye.

46
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,000
And then it goes into the part of our brain called the hypothalamus,

47
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,080
which governs our sleeping patterns, our hormones,

48
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,759
our behaviours, our appetite, it governs everything.

49
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,840
And so different colours and different frequencies

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,439
are different wavelengths of light.

51
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,759
We have different responses and different reactions to them.

52
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,719
So colour is wavelengths of light.

53
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,480
A wavelength is the distance between two waves of sound

54
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,240
or light that are next to each other.

55
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,560
As these wavelengths change, so does the colour we see.

56
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,719
Thanks to the Science Lesson, Karen also explained

57
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,439
that there's a part of our brain that controls.

58
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,039
She used the word govern, how we feel and how we behave.

59
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,679
And this can change depending on what colour we see.

60
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,879
Interesting stuff. Of course, colour can affect us differently.

61
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,359
Seeing red can make one person angry,

62
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:00,239
but someone else may just feel energized.

63
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,959
Homeware and furnishing manufacturers offer a whole spectrum all-ranged.

64
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,239
Of colours to choose to suit everyone's taste and mood,

65
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,039
but during the recent coronavirus pandemic,

66
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,280
there was a rise in demand for intense, bright shades and patterns.

67
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,840
This was referred to as happy design,

68
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,319
design that was meant to help lift our mood.

69
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,759
Yes, and Karen Hullert spoke a bit more about this on the UNIORS programme.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,039
In the time when everyone was out and we were all working and we'd lived very, very busy lives,

71
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,080
quite often what people wanted, they wanted a very quiet sanctuary to come back to,

72
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,719
so they had very power colours or very low chromatic colours in their house,

73
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:48,719
low saturation, because that helped them unwind, it helped them relax and to feel very

74
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,520
soosed. But what I have found since the first lockdown is a lot of people,

75
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,560
because they're not getting that outside stimulation,

76
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,039
they're actually putting a lot of brighter colours in their home,

77
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,439
because they're trying to bring in that feeling that they would have got when they were out,

78
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,879
that excitement and that buzz.

79
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,159
It seems that in our normal busy working lives,

80
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,280
our homes were peaceful places and somewhere to relax, they were a sanctuary.

81
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,800
To create this relaxing space we use pale colours,

82
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,360
one set lack intensity like sky blue.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,360
But during the recent lockdowns when we weren't outside much,

84
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,600
we tried to get that stimulation, that excitement or experience,

85
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,439
by decorating our homes with brighter colour, such as yellow.

86
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,759
Perhaps a little too bright for me, it's all about personal taste and the connections we

87
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,039
make with the colours we see, but it makes sense that brighter colours can certainly lift our mood.

88
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,959
Now, earlier I asked you Georgina, do you know what the splitting of white light into its

89
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:57,759
different colours is called? Is it A, dispersion, B, reflection or C, refraction?

90
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,399
And I said it was refraction.

91
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,399
Sorry Georgina, that's wrong, it's actually called dispersion, back to school for you,

92
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,519
but not before we recap some of today's vocabulary.

93
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,639
Okay, firstly we can describe someone who wishes they had what someone else has

94
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,159
as being green with envy.

95
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:22,079
We also talked about a wavelength, the distance between two waves of sound or light

96
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,679
that are next to each other.

97
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:26,079
To govern means to control or influence.

98
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,919
A sanctuary can be a peaceful or relaxing place,

99
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,359
in some cases it can be a safe place for someone in danger.

100
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,360
Stimulation describes the feeling of being excited, interested or enthused by something.

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,560
And pale describes a colour that lacks intensity, it's not very bright,

102
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,920
and for me they're much better than a bold bright yellow.

103
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,439
Well Georgina, thanks for showing your true colours.

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,960
That's all for now, but we'll be picking another topic to discuss out of the blue next time.

105
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,720

Bye for now.

109

Goodbye.
