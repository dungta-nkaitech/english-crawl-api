00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,039
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,080
And I'm Rob.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,879
In this program, we're talking about biscuits.

7
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:21,760
Biscuits?

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,400
Ha, a subject very close to my heart.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,359
Something important to me and that interests me.

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,039
I know, Rob. You are a biscuit connoisseur after all.

11
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,880
And in the UK, many of us love to nibble these sweet treats.

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,280
And we have lots of names for them too.

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,879
Yes, we have the chocolate digestive, the garabaldi,

14
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,200
the custard cream and the jammy dodger.

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,039
Oh, it's making my mouth water.

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,239
I can see.

17
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,200
But we're not going to be sucking into any biscuits today.

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,359
Instead, we'll be looking at the origins and the language of this humble snack.

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,039
And before we do that, Rob, let's test your knowledge of biscuits

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,240
with a question.

21
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,719
The British aren't the only fans of biscuits.

22
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,719
So in which country are Barrazex traditionally eaten?

23
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:09,280
Is it in A, Syria, B, Morocco or C, Spain?

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,680
Hmm, well, I've not eaten one, but I'll have a guess at Syria.

25
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:16,719
Okay, I'll reveal the right answer later on.

26
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:19,280
But now, let's talk more about biscuits.

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,599
Also, it's sometimes known as cookies.

28
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,799
They come in all shapes, sizes and varieties.

29
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,959
They can be sweet or savoury.

30
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:32,560
But I prefer the sweet ones that are crisp, crunchy and are good for dunking in my tea.

31
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,840
Dunking means dipping into a liquid for a short period of time.

32
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,640
But enough about your easing habits, Rob.

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,599
Let's find out how the biscuit got its name.

34
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,159
It's something the BBC Radio 4 programme word of mouth has been exploring.

35
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,000
Dr. Laura Wright, a historical linguist from the University of Cambridge,

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,439
explains its origins.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,679
From Latin biscoctum, twice cooked,

38
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:58,799
and it comes to us via Anglo-Norman French.

39
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,920
But it's bread that's been cooked twice to extract all the moisture

40
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,679
so that it goes hard and it'll stay fit for consumption for a long time,

41
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:08,400
which is why you can take it to sea and have a sea biscuit.

42
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,400
And from the 1500s at least, we spelled it like it sounds, B-I-S-K-E-T.

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,360
But at some point in the 1800s,

44
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,680
we started to prefer the French spelling for reasons of ponsiness.

45
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,880
So the English word for biscuits has its origins in Latin.

46
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,160
It describes cooking bread twice to make it hard.

47
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,160
This baking process meant a biscuit could be kept for a long time.

48
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,080
And as Dr. Wright said, it would stay fit for consumption,

49
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,840
another way of saying edible or able to be eaten.

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,800
That's why they were taken on long sea voyages.

51
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,200
But they weren't like the biscuits we eat now.

52
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,920
They were plain, simple and very hard-baked.

53
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,000
Interestingly, the word biscuit used to be spelled B-I-S-K-E-T.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,719
But the French spelling B-I-S-C-U-I-T was later adopted.

55
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Biscuits are a handy go-to snack for when I'm hungry or bored.

56
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,960
But how did biscuits become such a popular foodstuff

57
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,920
and how did we come to depend on them so much?

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,319
It's something Anastasia Edwards, author of Biscuits and Cookies,

59
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,479
a global history, talked about in the Word of Mouth program.

60
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,319
Listen to the word she uses to mean food in her explanation.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,199
One key fact in the rise of popularity of the biscuit is meal times.

62
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,839
Before the Industrial Revolution, people have a later breakfast and an earlier supper.

63
00:03:37,839 --> 00:03:42,639
By the end of the Industrial Revolution, breakfast is much earlier.

64
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,000
The evening meal is much later.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,039
So you've got this big gap of time where people need sustenance.

66
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,159
And so lunch comes to greater prominence and tea time comes to greater prominence and snacking.

67
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,359
So there's this great opportunity for really biscuits,

68
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:00,959
something small, something ready, something easily consumable,

69
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,119
not expensive, you know, a bit of a sugar rush.

70
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,560
Right. So it was the Industrial Revolution that led to the rise.

71
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,279
That's the increase in the popularity of biscuits.

72
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,360
Because the time between breakfast and dinner in the evening increased,

73
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,199
people got hungry and they needed food to give them energy.

74
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,519
What Anastasia called sustenance.

75
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,439
So this is when smaller meals, such as lunch or tea,

76
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,079
became important or more well known,

77
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,519
it had greater prominence.

78
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,800
And this included snacking on biscuits.

79
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,800
These were cheap and easily consumable, easy and quick to eat.

80
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,160
And because of their ingredients, they gave you a sugar rush,

81
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,840
a quick blast of energy.

82
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,560
Of course.

83
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,560
Now we eat biscuits at any time.

84
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,320
And because of their sugar content,

85
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,880
we know to only eat them in moderation, Rob.

86
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,400
I think a packet a day is fine.

87
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,440
But a whole box?

88
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,840
Well, that would really take the biscuits.

89
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,440
Take the biscuit.

90
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,720
Good idiom there, Rob, to mean be the most foolish,

91
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,960
annoying or surprising thing to do.

92
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,480
But now let's find out the answer to my quiz question.

93
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,560
Earlier, I asked which country are Barazx traditionally eaten in?

94
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,360
And I thought, Syria, was I right?

95
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes, you were. Well done. You are a smart cookie.

96
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,360
Barazx are biscuits filled with roasted sesame seeds and pistachio chips.

97
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,920
They sound delicious. I would love to try some.

98
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,360
Okay, well, we've been discussing the language of biscuits

99
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,040
and mentioned some of these words.

100
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,800
Dunking describes dipping something, like a biscuit,

101
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,040
into liquid for a short period of time.

102
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,080
Describing something as being fit for consumption means it's edible,

103
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,840
which is another one of our words,

104
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,000
and it means it can be eaten.

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,080
Sustinance is another word for food,

106
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,760
and something that has prominence is important or more well-known.

107
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,480
And when you get a sugar rush,

108
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,879
you get a quick blast of energy from,

109
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,400
unsurprisingly, eating something containing lots of sugar.

110
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,759
Okay, well, we only get six minutes for this program.

111
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,680
That's the way the cookie crumbles,

112
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,120
so we're out of time.

113
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,079
Bye for now.

114
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,560
Goodbye.
