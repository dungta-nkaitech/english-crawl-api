Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,160
And I'm Rob.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,080
Now Rob, you look like you enjoy a good meal.

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,000
Ha, well I do like eating out, and I like to think I know a good meal when I have one.

7
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,079
Well, that should give you an advantage with today's quiz.

8
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:34,159
In 2016, which is the last year we have statistics for,

9
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,799
how many restaurants and mobile food services were there in the UK?

10
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,240
Was it A, about 75,000?

11
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,200
B, about 83,000 or C, about 93,000?

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,280
Well, I know there are a lot, so I'm going to say 93,000, but that is just a guess.

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,320
I'll reveal the answer a little later in the programme.

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,039
Today we're talking about being a foodie.

15
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,200
Rob, what is a foodie?

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,680
Well, I would describe a foodie as someone who has a strong interest in food.

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,000
They like preparing it as well as eating it.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,960
They like using good ingredients, and they're probably not fans of fast food.

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,159
Angela Hartnett is one of Britain's top chefs.

20
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,079
In the BBC podcast The Bottom Line, she talked about this topic.

21
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,280
In this first clip, how does she describe people who say they are foodies?

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,200
I think people who say they're foodies, by the books watch TV and will cook a little bit.

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,280
She's saying that people who say they are foodies may not actually know that much about food.

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,000
They buy books and watch cookery programmes on TV and will cook a little bit.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,599
A little bit is a common phrase that means a small amount,

26
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,840
and if you do something a little bit, it means you don't do it a lot.

27
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,480
You could just say a little, but adding a bit to the phrase makes it very natural.

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,400
Well, we heard a little bit of Angela Hartnett there.

29
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,760
Let's hear more now.

30
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,760
What's her description of a foodie?

31
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:09,280
My idea of a foodie is the very European idea that people go and shop every day.

32
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,080
They understand one end of a pig from another.

33
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,840
And maybe that's a bit romantic, but my mother and I look at my grandmother and I are back.

34
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,640
And they made food. They knew about what was expensive, they knew about quality and stuff like that.

35
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,800
Rob, do you know one end of a pig from another?

36
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,759
Well, I hope so.

37
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,960
But the point Angela Hartnett is making is that a true foodie has a good understanding,

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,240
for example, of the different parts of an animal that are used in cooking and what they used for.

39
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,759
She says that idea might be a bit romantic.

40
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,520
We normally think of the word romantic when we're talking about love and relationships,

41
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,280
but that's not what it means here is it.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,760
No, romantic can also describe a pleasant ideal,

43
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,960
an imaginary perfect way of life that forgets about the difficult things of everyday existence.

44
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,160
Let's hear some more from chef Angela Hartnett now.

45
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,439
What is she worried about?

46
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,120
I think we think we're foodies, but I think food is expensive in this country.

47
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,800
I don't think it's affordable for lots of people.

48
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,160
And I think we are in danger of not knowing, you know, how to cook anymore,

49
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,759
how to make a meal for a family of four for five pounds.

50
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,000
So Rob, what is Angela Hartnett worried about?

51
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,400
She commented that food was very expensive here in Britain.

52
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,039
Many people don't have enough money to buy it.

53
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,519
As she said, it's not affordable.

54
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,479
She thinks we might be in danger of not being able to feed our families cheaply.

55
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,319
Can you say a bit more about the phrase in danger of?

56
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,639
Sure, the phrase to be in danger of is followed by a gerund,

57
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,479
and it means that there is the possibility of something bad happening.

58
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,959
It's not happened yet, but it could happen.

59
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,239
Thanks Rob. Right.

60
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,719
Well, we're in danger of running out of time.

61
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,120
So let's get to the answer to the question I asked at the start of the program.

62
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,719
I asked how many restaurants or mobile food services there were in the UK in 2016.

63
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,240
And I said it was a guess, 93,000, but was I right?

64
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,639
I'm afraid you're 10,000 out.

65
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,839
The answer is approximately 83,000.

66
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,639
Right. Well, I've still got a few more to get to before I can tick them all off my list.

67
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,439
Me too.

68
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,920
Well, before we go, let's recap the words and phrases we talked about today.

69
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,399
The first was Foudie.

70
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:36,639
Yes, Foudie is a modern word to describe someone who is very interested in all aspects.

71
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,480
Of food from buying, preparing and cooking to eating.

72
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,560
And someone who may or may not know which end of a pig is which.

73
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,280
Well, I think you're being a little bit silly there, aren't you?

74
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,600
Well, a little bit was our next phrase, wasn't it?

75
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,880
Yes, a little bit.

76
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,160
A very simple but a very natural conversational phrase that means a small amount.

77
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,520
The next word was the adjective romantic,

78
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,400
not used in the context of love here, though, was it?

79
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:07,120
No, it wasn't. A romantic idea here is one that is not realistic,

80
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,159
but is an imagined perfect situation.

81
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:13,679
For example, we have a very romantic view of our childhoods

82
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:17,839
when every Christmas was a white Christmas and every summer holiday was baking hot

83
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,359
and spent on the beach.

84
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:20,959
Of course, it wasn't like that at all.

85
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,079
In reality, both Christmas and summer were cold and rainy.

86
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,359
Then we had the adjective affordable for something we have enough money to buy.

87
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,960
Finally, the phrase to be in danger of.

88
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,840
Yes, meaning the possibility of something bad happening.

89
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,240
Well, that's it for this programme.

Bye-bye.

96
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,560
Well, I have to say.

97
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,920
I'm a little bit hungry and if I don't get some food soon,

98
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,240
I'm in danger of getting very grumpy.

99
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,480
You're always grumpy, Neil, but there is a very affordable cafe around the corner.

100
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,680
Let's head over there now, shall we?

101
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,160
Hmm.

102
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,000
