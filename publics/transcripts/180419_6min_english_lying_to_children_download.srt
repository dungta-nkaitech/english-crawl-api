From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,199
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,199
And I'm Rob.

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:17,960
Rob.

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,440
When you were a child, did you have a pet?

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:26,160
Er, yes, we had a few pets and my favourite was a little fluffy hamster.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,440
And what happened to your hamster?

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,880
Well, one day I got home from school and he wasn't in his cage.

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,240
I was worried for a bit in case he'd escaped or got hurt, but it was alright.

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,799
My mum told me that he'd gone to live on a farm

14
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:42,560
so that he could run around with other animals.

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,880
Really?

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,200
Yes, really.

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,400
A hamster.

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,480
Went to live on a farm.

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,600
To be with other animals?

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,719
Really?

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,480
Well, when you put it like that,

22
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,719
I think that was probably one of those lies that parents tell their children

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,919
so as not to make them sad.

24
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:03,439
Oh, well I'm sad now.

25
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,560
Well, maybe having a go at this quiz will cheer you up.

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,159
According to a study by a US psychologist,

27
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:14,199
what percentage of people will lie in a typical 10-minute conversation?

28
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:20,120
Is it a, 40%, b, 50%, or c, 60%.

29
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,959
I think most people don't lie that much.

30
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,399
So I'll say 40%.

31
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:28,919
OK, well, we'll reveal the answer a little later in the program.

32
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:31,280
So today, we're talking about lies

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,639
and particularly the lies that parents tell children.

34
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:38,439
The topic was discussed on the BBC Radio 4 program, Woman's Hour.

35
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:40,919
A guest on that program was Dr. Chris Boyle,

36
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:43,519
a psychologist at Exeter University.

37
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,239
He talks about a particular kind of lie.

38
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,119
We tell these lies not because we want to hurt people.

39
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,039
What colour are these lies called?

40
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,880
A white lie is just a distortion of truth

41
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,240
without malicious intent.

42
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,360
So as long as there's not malicious intent,

43
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,520
I think it's something that we do.

44
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,840
It's almost a societal norm that has become where it is acceptable

45
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,400
that we do tell certain lies.

46
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,439
It's certain times.

47
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,240
Dr. Chris Boyle there,

48
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,640
what colour is the kind of lie he was talking about?

49
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,120
It's a white lie.

50
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,800
He says a white lie is just a distortion of the truth.

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,400
Distortion here means a changing or bending of the truth.

52
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,320
These kind of lies are okay

53
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,680
as long as we don't tell them because we want to hurt someone.

54
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,200
He used the phrase malicious intent

55
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,439
to talk about a bad reason for doing something, didn't he?

56
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,439
Yes, intent is the reason or purpose for doing something

57
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,720
and malicious is an adjective which means cruel or nasty.

58
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,720
So without malicious intent means without wanting to hurt

59
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,240
or be cruel to someone.

60
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,560
He said that this kind of white lie was almost a societal norm.

61
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,719
Can you explain what he means by that?

62
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:59,360
Yes, something that is the norm is something that is expected,

63
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,960
it's regular and usual.

64
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,560
The adjective societal comes from the noun society.

65
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,800
So a societal norm is something that is regular and common

66
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,600
in your culture or society.

67
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,960
So do you think your mum's story about the hamster and the farm

68
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,520
was a little white lie?

69
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,480
Ah, yes, I'm sure it was.

70
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,879
She didn't do it with malicious intent.

71
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:21,199
She didn't want to hurt me.

72
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,519
In fact, just the opposite.

73
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:24,399
She wanted to protect me.

74
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:27,319
Yes, that's one kind of white lie that parents tell

75
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,599
to protect children.

76
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,799
There are also a couple of other reasons.

77
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,919
One being the parent's convenience.

78
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:36,519
Ah, yes, I remember my mum telling me that on certain days

79
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:38,399
the park wasn't open.

80
00:03:38,399 --> 00:03:40,120
I know now that it never closed.

81
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,280
I guess at the time she was just too busy to take me.

82
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,879
And then there are the cultural lies that parents tell children.

83
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,280
All right, what do you mean by that?

84
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,199
Well, first, if you have any children listening to this right now,

85
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,319
you might want to cover their ears for a few seconds.

86
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,439
Rob, I'm talking about, for example, Father Christmas

87
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,519
and the tooth fairy.

88
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,280
Ah, right, yes, there's no malicious intent

89
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,199
in telling children those stories.

90
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:09,159
It's a cultural and societal norm.

91
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:12,960
Let's listen to Dr. Chris Boyle again, talking about white lies.

92
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,280
A weight lie.

93
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,759
It's just a distortion of truth

94
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,120
without malicious intent.

95
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,240
So as long as there's not malicious intent,

96
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,399
I think it's something that we do.

97
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:26,719
It's almost a societal norm that has become where it is acceptable

98
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:29,279
that we do tell, say, on lies.

99
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,159
It's at certain times.

100
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:33,719
So now back to our question at the top of the programme.

101
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:36,079
I asked what percentage of people will lie

102
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,360
in a typical 10-minute conversation?

103
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,800
Was it a 40%, b 50% or c 60%?

104
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
What did you say, Rob?

105
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,120
I said a just 40%.

106
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,040
Well, I'm afraid the answer was 60%.

107
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,680
Really? Goodness, 60%.

108
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,319
That's more than I expected.

109
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,720
Right, well, before we go,

110
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,160
let's recap the vocabulary we talked about today.

111
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,840
The first expression was white lie.

112
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,439
A lie we tell without meaning to hurt someone.

113
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,199
For example, when I say to you,

114
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,920
he looked nice today.

115
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,759
Weight?

116
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,240
What did you say?

117
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,000
But that is actually a distortion of the truth,

118
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
a changing or bending of the truth.

119
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,639
This makes me think of the next expression, malicious intent.

120
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,800
Intent is the reason or purpose for doing something

121
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,160
and doing something with a malicious intent

122
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,000
is doing it deliberately to be cruel or to hurt someone.

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,360
And I think you have a malicious intent, Neil,

124
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,240
telling me that when you say I look nice, it's just a lie.

125
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,959
I'm just kidding.

126
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,360
Well, that's the norm for you, isn't it?

127
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,439
Just kidding.

128
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,839
A norm is the standard or normal way that something is.

129
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,240
In the clip, we heard societal norm,

130
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,160
which is the accepted or normal way something is done

131
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,120
in society.

132
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,720
For example, telling children about father Christmas.

133
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,840
Shhh.

134
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,079
Well, sadly, this isn't a lie,

135
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:55,160
but that's all for this program.
