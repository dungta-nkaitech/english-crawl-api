00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,600
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,800
And I'm Rob.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,920
Once in a while, a long comes a scientist who captures the public imagination

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,199
and communicates their passion for science in an exciting and understandable way.

7
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,399
In this programme, we'll be meeting one of America's best known popular scientists,

8
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,479
astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson. He's a man with a gift for communicating and inspiring people

9
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:46,719
with his television shows and books on cosmology, the study of the origin and nature of the universe.

10
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,879
In his day job, he runs the Hayden Planetarium in New York's American Museum of Natural History.

11
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,320
But Neil's real mission is to encourage scientific thinking among the American public.

12
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,719
We'll be hearing from the famous astronomer and learning some new vocabulary soon.

13
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,280
But first, I have a question for you, Sam.

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,120
Science is ever changing with new discoveries updating our understanding all the time.

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,960
For centuries, the Earth was thought to be the centre of the universe.

16
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,359
But who was the first astronomer to have the correct idea that, in fact,

17
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,799
the Earth and the planets revolve around the Sun?

18
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:25,119
Was it A. Nikolaus Copernicus?

19
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,480
B. Isaac Newton?

20
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,799
Or C. Galileo? Galileo?

21
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,759
Hmm, I'll say it was C. Galileo.

22
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,039
Okay, Sam, I'll reveal the correct answer later in the programme.

23
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:41,120
Recent events like the Covid pandemic and climate crisis have put scientists under pressure

24
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,719
from critics motivated by political views.

25
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,719
Neil deGrasse Tyson thinks facts are not dependent on politics,

26
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,760
but should be established with a scientific method,

27
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,000
a process of finding the truth through testing and experimentation.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,840
He is Neil explaining more about the scientific method to BBC World Service programme Hard Talk.

29
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,479
If you have a brilliant idea and you test it and it un-earthes so much of what has been known before,

30
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,000
we're going to double-check that.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,120
The rest of us.

32
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,719
When he said, well, did he do it?

33
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,400
Cross his teeth and dot his eyes.

34
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,039
Did he?

35
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,679
The power that's driving his experiment, you know, the wall current,

36
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:22,479
let me check how that was conceived and done.

37
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,599
And if no one can duplicate your results, it's not a result.

38
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,079
Before scientists can confirm the truth of an experiment,

39
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:32,079
their findings must be double-checked.

40
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,639
Making certain something is correct by carefully examining it again.

41
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,319
This process is called peer review.

42
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,959
Other scientists double-checking the experiment

43
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,200
to make sure everything was done correctly.

44
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,920
One way they do this is to duplicate or repeat the experiment

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,080
to see if they get the same result.

46
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,280
In other words, Neil wants scientists to have crossed the teeth and dotted the eyes,

47
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,879
a phrase which means paying attention to the small details of whatever you're doing.

48
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,760
A scientific approach requires an open mind and critical thinking,

49
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,879
but Neil believes the most important thing is to know the difference between fact and opinion.

50
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,719
People have opinions about all kinds of things, but that doesn't make what they believe a fact.

51
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,960
Yet fact and opinion are becoming harder to separate,

52
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,159
as protest by anti-vaccine groups and climate change deniers have shown,

53
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,439
many Americans, even presidents, seem suspicious of scientific fact.

54
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,280
It's a worrying trend that Neil thinks is a result of the US education system,

55
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,400
as he told BBC World Service Program Hard Talk.

56
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,200
It has to do with how science is taught in the schools.

57
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,560
It's currently taught as a body of information,

58
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,360
the sexual effects that are imparted upon you,

59
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,240
and then you regurgitate that for an exam.

60
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,560
That's an aspect of science, but it's not the most important part of science.

61
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,159
The most important part of science is knowing how to question things,

62
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:11,360
and knowing when an answer has emerged that represents an objective truth about this world.

63
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,040
Neil says that science is taught by encouraging students to regurgitate facts,

64
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,560
to repeat information without properly understanding it.

65
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,400
Knowledge is important, but what's also needed is a questioning attitude that can recognize

66
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,080
objective truth, a truth about the natural world,

67
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,960
which is not influenced by human bias, opinions, or emotion.

68
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,520
Without that, anyone is free to call whatever they like a fact,

69
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:41,599
which only leads to chaos.

70
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,839
Right, no matter how hard I believe the moon is made of cheese,

71
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,680
or the sun goes around the earth, believing it doesn't make it true.

72
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:53,759
That sounds like something Neil deGrasse Tyson would agree with,

73
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,519
and maybe Galileo too.

74
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:01,359
Yes, in my question, I asked who first came up with the idea that the earth revolves around the sun.

75
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:05,039
And I said it was a nascent astronomer, Galileo.

76
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,680
Ah, which was the wrong answer I'm afraid.

77
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,360
Galileo knew the earth revolved around the sun,

78
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,400
but the first person with the idea was Polish astronomer Nikolas Kepernicus in 1543.

79
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,360
Unfortunately, centuries before the invention of television could spread the news of this

80
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,439
objective truth, a provable truth, which is uninfluenced by human bias or opinion.

81
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:36,240
Okay, let's recap the rest of the vocabulary from our chat about American scientist Neil deGrasse

82
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,040
Tyson and his love of cosmology, the study of the universe.

83
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,639
To double-check something means to make certain it's correct by carefully re-examining it.

84
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,160
One way scientists do this is to duplicate or repeat exactly an experiment.

85
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,199
The idiom cross the T's and dot the eyes means to pay close attention to the details of what you're doing.

86
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,120
And finally, if you regurgitate facts, you just repeat them without properly understanding them.

87
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,759
Something a true scientist would never do.

88
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,240
Once again, our six minutes are up.

89
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,120
Goodbye for now.

90
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,600
Bye.
