From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:14,560
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Dan.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,919
And I'm Neil.

7
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,600
Now, Neil, do you like going to live football matches?

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,800
Oh yes, I love it.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,359
Is it better than watching them on TV?

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,879
Well, you don't really see as much as you do on TV,

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,679
but then on TV you don't really feel the atmosphere.

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,039
You can't sing along with the chants and songs at home.

13
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:35,519
Well, it's good you mention the songs and chants

14
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:37,519
because that is today's topic.

15
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:39,920
It seems that for some football clubs,

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,920
the atmosphere in the stadiums is becoming a bit quiet.

17
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,359
Now, before we look at this topic in more detail,

18
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:49,200
here is today's quiz.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,719
As we're talking about football,

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,120
in which decade was the first ever international football match played?

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,280
Is it A in the 1870s, B in the 1890s or C

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,039
in the 1910s?

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:01,840
Mmm.

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,599
I could be wrong, but I think it was before the turn of the century,

25
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:07,840
so I'll say the 1890s.

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,120
Well, we'll see if you're right or not later in the show.

27
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,200
Now, songs and chants are part of the experience of football matches,

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,799
but where do they come from?

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,159
What are they about?

30
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,719
Here's Joe Wilson from BBC Sport.

31
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,879
Which team name does he mention?

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,120
Some songs can be witty,

33
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,760
honed specifically to celebrate a certain player

34
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,840
or moment in a club's history.

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,600
Others rely more on a hypnotic repetition of syllables,

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,920
united, for example.

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,640
So which team does he mention?

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,920
Well, he used the syllables from United.

39
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,280
This isn't one team as there are quite a few professional teams in Britain

40
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,200
that have united in their names.

41
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,120
In fact, there are over a dozen.

42
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,160
Perhaps the most well-known, though, would be Manchester United.

43
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,920
I think fans of Welling United might argue with you about that.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,920
Anyway, what did Wilson say about the nature of football songs?

45
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,159
He said they could be witty.

46
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,799
Witty means funny, but in a clever way.

47
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,120
He also said that they could be honed.

48
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,280
Honed is an interesting word here.

49
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,319
Something that is honed is carefully crafted,

50
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,560
skillfully created, and developed over a period of time.

51
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,639
When it comes to witty football songs,

52
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,719
Wilson describes them as being honed to be about a particular player

53
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,039
or a moment in a club's history.

54
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,199
But these aren't the only kinds of songs.

55
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,840
Another kind of song he describes is the hypnotic repetition of syllables.

56
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,599
Something that is hypnotic repeats again and again,

57
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,079
like a magical spell or chant.

58
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,319
What's interesting is that in football songs,

59
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,039
words can have more syllables than you would expect.

60
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,840
Oh, yes. For example, let's take England.

61
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,039
Two syllables, right?

62
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:47,439
Right.

63
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,239
Wrong.

64
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,599
At least in a football stadium, it becomes three syllables.

65
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,120
Ingle learning.

66
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,399
All right. Thank you.

67
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,400
Let's listen to Mr. Wilson again.

68
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,480
Some songs can be witty, honed specifically to celebrate a certain player

69
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,560
or moment in a club's history.

70
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,400
Others rely more on a hypnotic repetition of syllables,

71
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,640
united, for example.

72
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
Now, apparently, in many stadiums,

73
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,400
the crowds aren't singing as much as they used to.

74
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,680
Some managers have complained that the fans are too quiet

75
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,719
and that this has a negative effect on the players.

76
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,040
So what are some of the reasons for this?

77
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,679
Here's BBC Sports Joe Wilson again.

78
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:27,599
How many reasons does he mention?

79
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,399
So what reasons did he give for the decline in singing?

80
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:49,439
For the fact that singing is getting less common?

81
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,120
He gave a number of reasons.

82
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,599
He talked about the change in demographics.

83
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,560
Demographics refers to a section of the population

84
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,240
that do a particular thing.

85
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,520
It can refer to age groups or wealth, for example.

86
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,000
What Wilson says is that the members that make up a football crowd are changing.

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,759
They are older and wealthier.

88
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,879
And perhaps that is a demographic or group

89
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,599
that is less likely to sing in public.

90
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,920
Another reason he gives is that sitting down

91
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,720
might also discourage people from singing.

92
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,880
If something discourages you, it makes you not want to do it.

93
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,680
Most stadiums in the UK have to have seats

94
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,880
and maybe singing is something that people feel happier doing

95
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,240
when they're standing up.

96
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,760
Well, the final whistle is about to blow on today's programme.

97
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,200
Before that though, here's the answer to our quiz question.

98
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,720
I asked you when the first international football match took place

99
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,120
and I took a guess with the 1890s.

100
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,040
And that's a red card, I'm afraid, Neil.

101
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,480
The first international football match took place in the 1870s

102
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,640
between England and Scotland.

103
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,240
Oh, come on, Raf.

104
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,439
And now to take us to the whistle, let's review today's vocabulary.

105
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:04,160
The first word we had was witty, a kind of humour that's smart and clever.

106
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,400
Then we had honed for something that's crafted and improved over time.

107
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,759
A bit like my physique.

108
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,000
I've been honing my body in the gym.

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,960
Really?

110
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,400
Are you being witty?

111
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,920
I wasn't trying to.

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,280
Anywho, we then heard about hypnotic repetition

113
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,680
to describe the effect of thousands of people

114
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:30,080
repeating the syllables of a football team over and over and over and over and over and over and over.

115
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,960
Okay, Dan.

116
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,240
Okay, Dan.

117
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,800
We used the phrase a decline in to say that something is getting less.

118
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,400
Demographics refers to a group or section of the population

119
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,639
that is involved in a particular activity.

120
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,200
And finally, we had the verb discourage

121
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,079
for something that makes us less likely to do something.

122
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,000
Well, that's it for this programme.

123
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,439
If you're not interested in football,

124
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,000
I hope we didn't discourage you from listening again.

125
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,279
Indeed, I hope it doesn't lead to a decline in our audience.

126
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,240
We want to have as wide a demographic as possible.

127
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,879
So with that in mind, don't forget to find us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.

128
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,719
And of course, on our website, BBCLearningEnglish.com.

129
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:09,360
Bye-bye.

130
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,000
Goodbye.
