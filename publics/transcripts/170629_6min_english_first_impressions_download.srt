Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English,

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,039
the program where we explore an interesting topic

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,679
and bring you six bits of useful vocabulary.

6
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:20,320
I'm Neil.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,199
And I'm Rob.

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,839
Today we're talking about first impressions

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,440
and how they're often wrong.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,400
So let's start with the term first impression.

11
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,359
It's the idea or opinion that you have about someone

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,920
after meeting them for only a short time.

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,320
It's very natural to make a quick judgment

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,920
about someone based on their appearance or facial expression.

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,759
We're going to be hearing about the research

16
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,399
of Professor Alexander Todorov from Princeton University in the US.

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,000
First though, a question.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,039
How long does he say it takes to form an impression

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,719
about someone's face?

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,119
Is it A under one second, B one second

21
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,960
or C six seconds?

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,039
I'll go for B one second.

23
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,479
Well we'll find out if you're right

24
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,239
or not later on in the program.

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,079
So Alexander Todorov has been researching our impressions.

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,599
His tests asked people to decide whether they thought

27
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:16,000
faces were dominant, competent, trustworthy or extroverted.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,079
Let's just look at those words for a second.

29
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,599
Dominant means being strongest or most important.

30
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,560
Competent means being able to do things.

31
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,680
While if you're trustworthy, it means people trust you.

32
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,600
You are worth their trust.

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,400
And being extroverted means you are energetic

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,640
and enjoy spending time with others.

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,640
So what did he find out?

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,680
Faces that look happy and feminine, like a woman,

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,159
were rated as more trustworthy.

38
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,040
While faces that were more masculine, like a man,

39
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,640
were seen as more dominant.

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,400
Why do faces with big eyes were seen as more extroverted?

41
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,640
Now the important thing is that Todorov says

42
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,280
that these judgments aren't accurate.

43
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,560
Someone who looks competent isn't necessarily competent.

44
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,319
So what does this mean in practice?

45
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,599
Here's Professor Todorov.

46
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,719
Trustworthiness, dominance, and attractiveness are the three big things

47
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,439
that we form impressions of people.

48
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,879
But interestingly, we have done some work predicting

49
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,960
the electoral success of politicians

50
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,360
and the judgment that is most predictive

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,639
of who is going to win the election is perceived competence.

52
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,839
And this is not random at all,

53
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:27,759
because if you ask voters what is the most important attribute

54
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:30,719
of a politician, competence is the one on the top.

55
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,559
Okay, so this is actually quite significant.

56
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:37,759
People say that the most important attribute or quality

57
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,679
for a politician is competence, the ability to do things.

58
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:43,519
Well, that sounds fair enough.

59
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,719
But because we make judgments based on appearance,

60
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,279
this can actually affect how people vote.

61
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,199
If voters believe or perceive someone to be competent,

62
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,599
they're more likely to vote for him or her.

63
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,159
He says this applies especially to people

64
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,800
who are less educated about politics.

65
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,840
They're more likely to be influenced by appearance.

66
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,439
He says this applies to around 25% of voters.

67
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,080
So the number of people who go with their gut

68
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,280
is large enough to influence the outcomes of elections.

69
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,280
Wow, to go with your gut.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,520
That means to make a decision

71
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,000
which isn't based on rational thought.

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,520
It's based on instinct, on a feeling, on your gut.

73
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,960
Yes, your gut is your stomach and the organs in your belly.

74
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,879
So can we tell nothing from a person's face?

75
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,160
Todorov says faces carry useful information about things,

76
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,840
like a person's mental state and whether they're tired or sick.

77
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,560
But they don't tell you about a person's character.

78
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,360
Indeed, it's not only elections where this counts.

79
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,240
We also judge during job interviews and meetings.

80
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,400
So what can we do to minimise the chances of being affected?

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,800
Should we just close our eyes when we meet people?

82
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,879
Well, it's not such a bad idea.

83
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,240
There's the example of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

84
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,400
Back in the 1950s, it was entirely made up of male musicians.

85
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,520
Then they introduced blind auditions.

86
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,200
In other words, they listened to new musicians without looking at them.

87
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,640
Okay, and what happened?

88
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,800
I guess many more women were selected.

89
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,400
Exactly, around 50%.

90
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,120
Of course, gender and race are also huge factors in how we perceive faces.

91
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,319
Todorov says we tend to react most positively to faces that look like our own.

92
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,120
Right. Well, I guess we just need to take a deep breath and try not to judge too much.

93
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,280
Easier said than done, I'm afraid, especially when we judge so quickly.

94
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,920
But do we do it in under a second, one second, or six seconds?

95
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,759
Aha, I said one second.

96
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,360
According to Todorov, it takes under one second.

97
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,720
Ah, I think it's safe to say it's very fast.

98
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,360
So shall we quickly go through today's vocabulary?

99
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,520
Okay, first up, first impression.

100
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,840
The first judgment you make about something.

101
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,600
What was your first impression of me, Rob?

102
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,319
Well, I thought you were very trustworthy and extroverted.

103
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,680
Well, isn't that convenient and accurate?

104
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,759
Because those were exactly the two adjectives I wanted to look at next.

105
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,080
Being trustworthy is important in life.

106
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,360
It means people trust you.

107
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,400
And being extroverted is more of a character type.

108
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,560
Extroverts like to be with people and are often seen as confident.

109
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,639
Whereas the opposite introverts usually need to spend time on their own and aren't as loud.

110
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,840
Both of these are interesting attributes or qualities.

111
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,720
You could say that mathematical ability is an essential attribute for an engineer.

112
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,560
And competence is the number one attribute for a politician.

113
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,240
Although people don't always vote depending on actual competence,

114
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,319
they base it on their perception.

115
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,280
What they see or perceive its competence.

116
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,639
Perceived competence might be different from actual competence.

117
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,480
Yes, in many situations we tend to go with our guts.

118
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,280
We make decisions based on deep feelings.

119
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,400
Do you do that, Neil?

120
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,960
Yes, some things you can think about too much.

121
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,600
When I left my last job, I really just went with my gut.

122
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,439
It felt like the right thing to do.

123
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,720
Of course, because it meant coming to work here with me.

124
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,680
Naturally.

125
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,560
