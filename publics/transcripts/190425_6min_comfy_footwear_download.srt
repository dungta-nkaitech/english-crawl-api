5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,439
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Dan.

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:17,280
Let me just sit down.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,400
Ah, and I'm Neil.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,280
Neil, are you wearing high heels?

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,080
Hang on.

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,039
Ah, not anymore.

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,160
How did they feel?

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,280
Oh, agony. How do women do this?

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,799
Why on earth are you wearing them?

14
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,439
Well, I wanted to look fashionable and cool.

15
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,560
Everyone knows that high heels are the height of fashion

16
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,480
on the street at work and at parties.

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,840
I'm ready for anything.

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,320
I'm not so sure you're right there, Neil.

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,519
Our topic for this 6 Minute English is about the rise in popularity of the comfy shoe.

20
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:53,039
However, before we step into that, let's have our quiz question.

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,000
Which famous sports clothing companies first pair of running shoes?

22
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,000
Was inspired by the square pattern on a waffle-making machine.

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,479
Was it A, Adidas, B, Nike or C, Puma?

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,879
Well, I have no idea, so I'm going to say Adidas, because that's got marks.

25
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,679
We'll have to wait until later to find out.

26
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:19,439
So, what do you think of when I say comfy shoes?

27
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,759
Well, comfy is an adjective, which is an informal way of saying comfortable.

28
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,159
So, I suppose we're talking trainers,

29
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,000
but I was always told that trainers weren't appropriate for everywhere,

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,039
like work and many formal or social places, such as parties, bars and clubs.

31
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:39,439
Well, that certainly used to be the case, but that may not be as true anymore.

32
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,439
Victoria Moss is the senior fashion editor at the Telegraph newspaper in the UK.

33
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,120
Here she is, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour,

34
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,239
about why trainers are considered more fashionable these days.

35
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,039
Is it something that's happened very recently?

36
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,159
Well, I think it's been sort of coming on for a while,

37
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,679
and I think one thing in fashion in the last 10 years has been a sort of mass

38
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:07,200
casualisation of everything, and there's been a big streetwear trend,

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,719
which has filtered through, and that's...

40
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:12,400
So, is it something that's happened very recently?

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,000
Apparently not, no.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,359
She says that there's been a mass casualisation of things over the last 10 years.

43
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:24,639
Cualisation here means the process of becoming less formal and more relaxed.

44
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,319
Or casual, yes.

45
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,039
Society has relaxed its idea of what is considered formal or appropriate.

46
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,119
In addition, we're told there has been a big streetwear trend.

47
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:40,719
Streetwear is a style of casual clothing worn especially by young people from urban settings.

48
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:41,919
That's the city.

49
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,159
This trend has filtered through.

50
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,399
If something filters through, it appears or happens gradually over time.

51
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:54,159
So, presumably, the trend for streetwear filtered through from its specialised area,

52
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,520
into mainstream fashion, until everyone was following it.

53
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,719
Well, that explains why trainers are more fashionable these days,

54
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,000
but it doesn't explain why people are wearing them more.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Not everyone follows fashion, you know?

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes, Neil, I can see that when I look at you.

57
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,519
But you're forgetting the comfy part.

58
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,319
Emma Supple is a podiatrist, a foot doctor, who also spoke on woman's hour.

59
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,560
Here she is explaining why being comfy is so important.

60
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,080
What are people doing more these days that they weren't before?

61
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,479
So, what we're actually talking about is actually people for wellness,

62
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,159
walking more and doing more, and they're not going to do that in a lot of high heels.

63
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:35,920
So, trainers are changing the materials, they're now a lot of fabric trainers,

64
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,039
and if you've inherited foot problems, then that kind of fabric, they're wrapping around,

65
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,039
nobly bits, and nobly bits hurt.

66
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,759
What are people doing more?

67
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,599
They're walking more, and they're doing it for wellness.

68
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,159
Wellness is the state of being healthy.

69
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,000
As a result, trainers have had to change their materials to fabric,

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,759
to make themselves more comfortable.

71
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,159
Not only that, but if you have any foot problems,

72
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,120
these fabric or cloth trainers are better at fitting to the shape of your foot.

73
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,719
That means if you have any nobly bits, they won't hurt as much,

74
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,439
which makes trainers more comfortable for everyone.

75
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,719
Nobly is an adjective that means lumpy, having many raised areas on the surface.

76
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,960
So, it's the combination of a change in fashion and a change in materials

77
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,640
that's made trainers and other comfy shoes more popular than ever, right?

78
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,360
Exactly.

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,960
And hard on the heels of that revelation, we can reveal the answer to our quiz question.

80
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,760
Earlier, I asked which famous sports clothing company's first pair of running shoes

81
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,040
was inspired by the square pattern on a waffle-making machine.

82
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,680
Was it A, Adidas, B, Nike or C, Puma?

83
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,720
Neil, you said,

84
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,400
I said Adidas.

85
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Sorry, the answer is Nike.

86
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,240
In 1971, their co-founder, Bill Bowerman, was having breakfast when he saw the waffle machine

87
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,280
at an inspired design of Nike's first running shoe.

88
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,960
Let's hope it was a comfy one.

89
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,880
Aha, it must be time to review our vocabulary.

90
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,240
So first, we had comfy, an adjective which is an informal way of saying comfortable.

91
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,320
Then we had casualisation.

92
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,080
This describes the process of things, such as fashion or behaviour,

93
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:17,199
becoming less formal and more casual.

94
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,639
Next was streetwear.

95
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,639
That describes a style of casual clothing, this worn especially by young people who live in cities.

96
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,639
Then we heard filtered through.

97
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,199
If something filters through, it appears or happens gradually over time.

98
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,719
For example, has it filtered through to you yet, Neil, that high heels were a mistake?

99
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:37,919
Yes, it has.

100
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,599
They didn't do anything for my wellness, I can tell you, which means the state of being healthy.

101
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,520
And lastly, we had nobly.

102
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,760
This adjective means lumpy, or having many raised areas on the surface,

103
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,600
like skin when it gets cold.

104
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,760
Do you have anything nobly on your foot, Neil?

105
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,760
Probably, my feet are killing me.

106
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,560
Aha, I think we found you're Achilles heel.

107
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,600
However, it's time to go, but we will be back.

108
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,720
In the meantime, you can find us in all the usual places online and on social media.

109
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,040
Just look for BBC Learning English.

110
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,840
Bye for now.

111
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,560
Goodbye.
