00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,359
Hello, this is 6 Minute English and I'm Rob.

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,640
And I'm Dan.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,920
Now Dan, do you know who Michelle Obama is?

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,600
Er, yeah. Maybe the most famous woman in the world.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,199
Former First Lady, which means she was the wife of the President of the United States of America.

9
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,399
That is correct.

10
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,759
She's just published her autobiography and has been talking in the UK about her life.

11
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,960
Before we find out more, here is this week's question.

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,719
When did the title First Lady first become used for the wife of the US President?

13
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,759
Was it in the 18th century?

14
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,719
Be 19th century or C 20th century? Any ideas, Dan?

15
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,799
This could be a trick question.

16
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,079
The first US Presidents were in the 18th century

17
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,519
and they had wives.

18
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:04,079
But I think the actual term may only have been introduced much later.

19
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,400
So I'm going to take a wild guess and say the 20th century.

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,920
Hmm, okay, well I'll have the answer later in the programme.

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,759
Michelle Obama's visit to the UK was covered on BBC News.

22
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,799
According to this report, where did she visit that she had visited before?

23
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,920
The former First Lady spoke openly about a number of issues

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,200
and one of her main messages was about empowerment.

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,200
Earlier in the day, Mrs. Obama revisited a school in North London,

26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,840
a place where she says she was first inspired to focus on education

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,000
during her time as the First Lady.

28
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,079
So where did she revisit on this trip?

29
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,400
She went to a school in North London.

30
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,840
She said it was at this school that she was first inspired to focus on education.

31
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,960
If you're inspired to do something, you get a strong feeling

32
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,399
that you want to do something.

33
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,679
You feel a strong motivation to achieve something particular,

34
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:03,919
often because of something someone else has said or achieved.

35
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:08,879
The report also mentioned that she spoke openly about a number of issues.

36
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,959
To speak openly about something is when you discuss a subject

37
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,280
often a difficult subject without trying to hide the facts or your feelings.

38
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,719
It's a phrase that's used when people talk about things in their life

39
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,879
that they find difficult or embarrassing.

40
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,319
One of the things she spoke openly about was her own feeling that she didn't really belong,

41
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,759
that she didn't have the skills or talent to be doing what she was doing

42
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,079
and that she didn't deserve her position.

43
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:37,680
There's a name for that. It's called imposter syndrome.

44
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,879
That feeling where you think one day everyone will realise

45
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,280
that you're really not very good at what you do.

46
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,800
I hear that feeling all the time.

47
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,599
Yeah, I wonder why.

48
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,960
Because the thing with this imposter syndrome is that it isn't justified,

49
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,000
it's more of a lack of confidence or a result of the way society labels us.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,840
Well, anyway, back to the report.

51
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,120
Michelle Obama was also keen to talk about the topic of empowerment.

52
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,120
That's giving people the strength, confidence and power to achieve what they want in life by themselves.

53
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,800
Let's hear from Michelle Obama herself now talking about how we sometimes judge people

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,400
based on their class rather than their individual abilities.

55
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,280
That's often the mistake that we make.

56
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,640
We assume that working-class folks are not highly gifted in their own right.

57
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,680
When a lot of times your station and life is limited by the circumstances

58
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,120
that you find yourself in.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,960
She says here that we assume things about people based on their social status or station in life.

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,879
To assume means to make a judgment which is not based on the facts,

61
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,319
but on what we think is true.

62
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,039
She uses the phrase in their own right.

63
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,319
When you say that someone is talented in their own right,

64
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,759
it means that their talent comes from their own skills and abilities.

65
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,560
And not because of any connection with any organization,

66
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,680
individual or class that they happen to be associated with.

67
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,759
Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week's question.

68
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:11,039
When did the title First Lady first become used for the wife of the US president?

69
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,079
What it in the A-18th century?

70
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,480
B-19th century?

71
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,279
Or C-20th century?

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,920
And Dan, you said I thought it was the 20th century.

73
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,759
Well, you were right.

74
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,639
Yay!

75
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,759
But let me finish.

76
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,439
You were right in that it was later than the 18th century,

77
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,879
which is when the first US presidents held their positions,

78
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,360
but it wasn't as late as the 20th century.

79
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,720
It was the second half of the 19th century when the title First Lady began to be used.

80
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,199
Now let's review today's vocabulary.

81
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,759
We started with the phrase to talk openly about something.

82
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,120
This means to discuss something, usually a difficult subject,

83
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,040
without hiding your feelings, emotions or facts about that subject.

84
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,080
Then there was the noun empowerment.

85
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,879
This is the process of giving people the feeling that they're in control of their lives,

86
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:07,759
making people more confident in their rights and abilities.

87
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:10,399
The verb inspire was next.

88
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,240
If you inspire people, you give them the feeling that they want to and can do something,

89
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
something difficult or creative.

90
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,360
If you have that feeling yourself, you are inspired.

91
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:25,360
Next, there was the verb to assume something.

92
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,759
To assume means to make a judgment about someone or something,

93
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,439
not based on proof, but on things you think or believe to be true.

94
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,879
The next phrase was in their own right.

95
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,920
If someone is successful in their own right, for example,

96
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,759
it means their success is because of their own skills and abilities,

97
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,720
and not because of who they work for or work with,

98
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,560
or which social group they came from.

99
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,199
And finally, there was the noun phrase station in life.

100
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,279
Your station in life is your position in society, your social status.

101
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:00,079
And that brings us to the end of this week's program.

102
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,759
We'll be back soon, and in the meantime,
