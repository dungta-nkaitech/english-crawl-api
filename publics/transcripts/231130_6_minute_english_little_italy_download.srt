00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,120
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,120
And I'm Georgie.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:20,160
Now, if I told you I'd been for a walk to see Big Ben and Buckingham Palace, you'd know

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,120
straight away I was in London.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,760
But what if my walk went past cafes selling mozzarella and ricotta, where I smelled freshly

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,440
made canolies and focaccia? Where would I be then?

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,679
Focaccia and mozzarella, well, you'd be in Italy, right?

9
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:43,079
Yes, Italy, or little Italy to be exact. The neighbourhood in some cities where Italian

10
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,439
communities settled and made their home.

11
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:51,960
These Italian arrivals opened shops and cafes selling food to their own communities.

12
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,920
Soon, dishes like spaghetti and meatballs attracted the attention of local people and gradually

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,440
Italian food became famous around the world. In this programme, we'll be taking a walk

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,799
through two little Italy's, one in Argentina, the other in New York. And as usual, we'll

15
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,640
be learning some useful new vocabulary as well. But before that, I have a question for you,

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,799
Georgie. According to a recent U-Gov poll, which Italian food is most popular with British

17
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,719
diners? Is it A, pizza, b, lasagna, or C, garlic bread?

18
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,799
I think it must be pizza.

19
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,200
OK, Georgie, I'll reveal the answer at the end of the programme.

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,840
One country Italians moved to was Argentina. In 1898, Giuseppe Banchero arrived in the

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,519
neighbourhood of La Boca, the little Italy of Buenos Aires, where many Italian immigrants

22
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:52,480
started restaurants. Here, Hugo Banchero, grandson of Giuseppe, tells his story to Veronica

23
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,640
Sminc, reporter for BBC World Service programme The Food Chain.

24
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,280
So, what culinary traditions did they bring with them?

25
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:36,719
Well, our culinary tradition is Pexeria and we incorporated the Faina from Genoa, which

26
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:46,239
is a pizza with chickpea flour. In 1898, Giuseppe founded his pizza rear, a restaurant selling pizza.

27
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,840
When a business is founded, it's established. Someone starts it up or sets it up.

28
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,160
But probably the best known little Italy in the world is an area of Manhattan's lower east

29
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,800
side in New York. 90% of Italian immigrants who arrived in the US at the turn of the century

30
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,639
came through this neighbourhood.

31
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:24,000
De Palos, one of the original shops selling Italian food in little Italy, has been serving

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,039
customers for 113 years. Here, Lue de Palo, co-owner and great grandson of the original owner,

33
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:37,199
Salvino, explains more about his family history to BBC World Service programme The Food Chain.

34
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,599
1925, when my grandmother, Concetta and my grandfather, Luigi, got married.

35
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,679
They opened their own shop. It's the shop we continue today. Being the fourth generation,

36
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:56,079
working alongside my system, Maria and my brother, Sal, and our children, the fifth generation.

37
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:02,319
Our business has expanded. Expanded to represent the full food culture of the 20 regions of Italy.

38
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,039
Little Italy is the stepping stone of the Italian immigrant. This is where many of the Italians

39
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:15,919
first came through Ellis Island and then settled here and then eventually moved into mainstream

40
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,000
America throughout the rest of the country.

41
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:24,240
Lue de Palo is the fourth generation of his family to run the shop and his children will be the fifth.

42
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:30,399
Frazes like fourth or fifth generation describe the children of people whose parents immigrated

43
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:36,000
to a particular country. After arriving in New York, many Italian immigrants moved on to start

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,839
successful new lives elsewhere. That's why Lue calls Little Italy a stepping stone,

45
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:47,679
an experience that helps you achieve something else, like a real stepping stone helps you cross a river.

46
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,839
As a result, Italian newcomers became accepted in mainstream America, mainstream,

47
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,239
meaning the culture and customs viewed as normal by most Americans.

48
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:04,000
It seems we owe a lot to Lue de Palo, but we still don't know which food is most popular here in the UK.

49
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,360
Isn't it time to reveal the answer to your question, Neil?

50
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,120
Right, I asked you which Italian food is most popular in Britain and you said pizza which

51
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,920
would be my guess too, but is the wrong answer I'm afraid? In fact, the top choice for Italian food

52
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,439
fans here in the UK is garlic bread. Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this

53
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:30,319
programme on Little Italy starting with pizza ria, a restaurant that sells pizza.

54
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:36,560
If something is founded, it started or established. The adjective culinary describes

55
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,759
anything connected with cooking. Frazes like fourth or fifth generation describe the

56
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,519
children of people whose parents immigrated to a particular country. A stepping stone is an event

57
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:53,920
or experience that helps you advance or achieve something new. And finally, the adjective mainstream

58
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,199
describes the customs and culture which are accepted as normal by most people in a society.

59
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,520
Once again, our six minutes are up. Until the next time here at six minute English, it's Ciao! Ciao!
