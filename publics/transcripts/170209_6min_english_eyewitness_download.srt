00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,599
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Catherine.

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,480
And I'm Neil.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,400
So, Neil, do you notice anything different about me today?

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,280
Have you done your hair differently?

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,160
No.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,600
Is that a new outfit?

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,800
Honestly, Neil.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,400
I give up.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,320
I don't know what's different about you.

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,679
OK, well, maybe by the end of the show, you'll have figured it out.

14
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:35,840
Anyway, today we're discussing memory

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,880
and whether we can remember things accurately.

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,840
So, are you ready to answer today's quiz question, Neil?

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,480
I am.

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,280
OK, so in which part of the brain

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,280
is there an area dedicated to remembering faces?

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,719
Is it A, the temporal lobe, B, the hypothalamus,

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,280
or C, the cerebellum?

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,679
Well, I have no idea.

23
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:01,920
But I'll say A, the temporal lobe.

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,480
OK, and we'll find out whether you chose a correct answer later on in the show.

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,039
But let's talk more about how our memories can play tricks on us.

26
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:14,480
We tend to think of memory as being like a video recorder

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,079
that we can replay and recall again and again as it originally occurred.

28
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,960
But memory doesn't work like that.

29
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,199
It's a reconstructive process.

30
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:27,439
A reconstructive process?

31
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,119
Yes, we reconstruct or rebuild memories.

32
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,719
And during this process, they may be distorted

33
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,919
or changed for different reasons.

34
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:39,839
Let's listen to Tim Valentine,

35
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:43,039
retired professor of psychology at Goldsmith College

36
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:47,359
at the University of London talking about this.

37
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:49,359
From all those TV dramas you've watched,

38
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,200
you'll be familiar with the forensic scenes of crime's officers

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,959
wearing their paper suits and covering their shoes and their hair

40
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:02,239
to make sure they don't introduce their DNA or physical traces onto the crime scene.

41
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:07,200
So that, in the same way, anybody who has any interaction with a witness

42
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,000
needs to make sure that they don't distort their memory.

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,599
So crime officers wear protective clothing at crime scenes

44
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,479
so they don't contaminate it with their DNA?

45
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,679
That's right. A crime scene is a place where a crime was committed

46
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:30,079
and contaminated means made impure through contact with an outside source.

47
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:34,959
So for example, if an officer touches something without gloves on,

48
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,679
they introduce new information.

49
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:42,560
And once this has happened, you can't get back to the original information.

50
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,280
Now, Tim Valentine says that when police officers talk to the witness of a crime,

51
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,840
they might also introduce new information.

52
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,439
And this could change the witness's memory of what happened.

53
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,280
And it isn't only police questioning that can distort memory.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,199
Other factors such as stress can affect your ability to recall events accurately.

55
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,960
For example, if you're being held at knife point,

56
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,759
you're likely to be concentrating on the weapon rather than on your attacker's face.

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,960
And at knife point means under threat of being stabbed.

58
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,640
So why do we place so much importance on eyewitness accounts?

59
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,640
Eyewitness accounts can sound very convincing in court.

60
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,080
But in fact, according to research, they're often unreliable.

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,560
Karen Neweith, senior attorney at the Innocence Project in New York, explains this further.

62
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,200
First, I think it's sort of natural for people to want to believe

63
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
that memory can be accurate.

64
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,239
It's very disconcerting to think that we're going through life,

65
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,759
relying on our memories, and then to learn how mistaken they can be and how frequently.

66
00:03:52,319 --> 00:04:00,639
Second is that the testimony of eyewitnesses has become a very expected piece of a criminal trial.

67
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,399
So jurors sort of anticipate it, look for it, and tend to believe it.

68
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,919
So we like to trust in our ability to remember things accurately,

69
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,239
and it's disconcerting to learn that memory is frequently inaccurate.

70
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,839
And disconcerting means...

71
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,240
It means confusing and a bit upsetting.

72
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:25,120
Karen Neweith also says that people expect eyewitness testimony or spoken statements in court.

73
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,639
Do you think that's true, Catherine?

74
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,240
Yes, and it's the most commonly used evidence brought against criminal defendants in court,

75
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,879
even though they're often inaccurate.

76
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,199
Are there any ways to improve accuracy?

77
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,240
Yes, there are.

78
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,519
For example, in a police line-up, you can prevent eyewitnesses receiving information

79
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,680
from the officer giving instructions, which might influence their response.

80
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,800
Yes, I see.

81
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,639
Well, you didn't give anything away when you asked what was different about your appearance

82
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,599
at the beginning of the show.

83
00:04:54,399 --> 00:05:01,279
Yes, that's true, Neil, but I can now reveal to you that I'm wearing glasses, Neil.

84
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,639
I've lost my contact lenses.

85
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,719
I don't know how I missed that, because actually you do look

86
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,279
well, completely different with glasses.

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,199
Just a bit, yes.

88
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,159
So now we're running out of time, so let's move on to the answer to today's quiz question.

89
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:23,759
Remember, I asked, in which part of the brain is there an area dedicated to recognizing faces?

90
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:30,399
Is it A, the temporal lobe, B, the hypothalamus, or C, the cerebellum?

91
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,319
And I said A, the temporal lobe.

92
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,039
Was I right?

93
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,800
You were indeed Neil, very well done.

94
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,599
Yes.

95
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,560
Correct answer.

96
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,680
The main part of the brain dedicated to recognizing faces called a fusing form face area

97
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,920
is positioned in the temporal lobe, which can be found roughly in the area just behind your ears.

98
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,800
Fascinating.

99
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,040
Now, here are the words we learned today.

100
00:05:53,040 --> 00:06:00,800
Reconstruct, distorted, crime scene, contaminated, at knife point,

101
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,840
disconcerting, testimony.

102
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,680
And that brings us to the end of today's six-minute English.

103
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,600
Don't forget to join us again soon.

104
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,079
Goodbye.

105
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,560
Bye.
