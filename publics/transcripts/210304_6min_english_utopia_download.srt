Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Rob.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,760
And I'm Georgina.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,440
In this program, we're looking for utopia.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,920
You mean a perfect world? A place where everyone lives together in harmony?

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,920
Does that kind of place exist, Rob?

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,880
Hmm, probably not. But it's something we aspire to create.

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,280
A happy place where everyone is cared for and nobody goes without.

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,800
Well, let me know if you find it and I'll head there straight away.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,439
Well, one place that is trying to be like that is the Dutch city of Amsterdam.

12
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:52,400
We're going to be finding out what they're doing with the help of some doughnuts.

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,000
But first, Georgina, I have a perfect question for you.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,920
According to the 2020 United Nations World Happiness Report,

15
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,640
which country is the world's happiest?

16
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,319
Is it A Finland, B Singapore or C Austria?

17
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,799
That's tricky, but I imagine that if only for the scenery it's A Finland.

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,359
Okay, Georgina, I'll tell you if you are right or wrong later on.

19
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,319
Anyway, let's get back to Amsterdam, a city that's doing its best to use creative ideas to be

20
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:30,399
sustainable. That's right and it's using the concept of a ring doughnut to use as a model for

21
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:35,759
its sustainability. Economist Kate Rayworth, who we will hear from shortly,

22
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,719
describes this as a picture of 21st century prosperity for humanity.

23
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:48,079
Now, thinking of this ring doughnut, the idea is not to leave anyone in the hole in the middle

24
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,239
falling short on the essentials of life. But at the same time, not going beyond the outer ring,

25
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:59,679
because there we put so much pressure on our planetary home, it can cause climate change.

26
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,799
So, here is Kate Rayworth speaking on the BBC World Service programme,

27
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,120
People Fixing the World, talking about how Amsterdam is trying to fit into this doughnut approach.

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,240
Amsterdam has started with a goal of saying we want to be thriving, inclusive, regenerative city

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,280
for all residents while respecting planetary boundaries. That's like saying we want our city

30
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:30,640
to live in the doughnut. And that changes how you build. You don't bring in more new raw materials

31
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,000
from across the other side of the world. You say, right, how do we reuse the construction

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,599
materials that are already in our city to build new buildings? How do we change the way that people

33
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,280
travel? Start asking very different questions from the outdated economic mindset that they were taught

34
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,520
before. Interesting stuff from Kate Rayworth there. The people of Amsterdam are trying to live

35
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,040
within the doughnut. Their aim is to live and look after each other without harming the planet.

36
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,680
It's a big aim, but they want their city to be thriving, so growing and being successful.

37
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,680
And it wants to be inclusive, including everyone and treating them equally. This is beginning to

38
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,600
sound like utopia, Rob. To achieve this, Kate talked about using locally sourced materials for

39
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,840
building and thinking about how people travel around, basically making it a sustainable city.

40
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,359
It's about people thinking differently and not doing things in the same way they've always been

41
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:34,240
done. It involves changing the way people think or their mindset. Another idea from the Netherlands

42
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:40,479
that fits the doughnut model is the making of recycled jeans. The people fixing the world programme

43
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:45,599
visited a company where old jeans were mixed with new organic cotton to make new ones.

44
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,239
The new ones might not be affordable for everyone, but they do reduce cotton production

45
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,639
and the use of chemicals and water. The process creates jobs too.

46
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:03,199
Well, let's hear from Bert Van Son, CEO of Mudgeens. Listen to why he tries to work within the doughnut

47
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:10,000
model. If you take the doughnut economy and you see the inside of the circles, if you break that

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,639
boundary, mistreat people and you have people making your jeans, but they don't have any social

49
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:20,959
security or any liberty or any medical care or those kind of things, you will never be able to

50
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,639
make nice jeans. It has to become human again, making clothing.

51
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:33,360
Bert Van Son sees the benefit of the doughnut economy by treating people fairly and with respect.

52
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,439
The opposite is to mistreat. He thinks they should have things such as social security,

53
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,759
a payment system by governments that helps people live a reasonable life.

54
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:50,399
And he says you can't make nice jeans without being human. He doesn't just mean being a person,

55
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,240
but being someone with compassion, feelings and respect for others.

56
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,920
Hmm, all this from a doughnut. Hopefully this will lead to a happier city and country.

57
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,000
But for now, what is the happiest country in the world, Georgina?

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes, you asked me earlier according to the 2020 United Nations World Happiness Report,

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,079
which country has been named the world's happiest? And I said Finland, come on, make me happy and

60
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:23,120
tell me I'm right. Well, happily you are correct, well done. Finland is top of the list for the third

61
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,279
year in a row, with Denmark coming in second. But before you head off there, we need to recap some of

62
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:36,000
the vocabulary we've discussed today. Of course, we've been discussing utopia, a perfect place where

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,239
everyone lives together in harmony. Thriving describes something that is growing and successful,

64
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:48,719
and inclusive means including everyone and treating them equally. We also mentioned mindset,

65
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:54,559
that describes the fixed thoughts and attitudes someone has. To mistreat someone is to treat them

66
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,639
badly or cruelly. And social security is a payment system by governments that helps people live

67
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,920
a reasonable life. Okay, well that's all for this programme. We'll see you again soon for more

68
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:11,120
