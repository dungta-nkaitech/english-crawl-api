Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, the show that brings you an interesting topic,

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,080
authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills.

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,640
I'm Dan and I'm Neil. In this program we'll be discussing armed police,

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,080
as well as teaching you six new items of vocabulary, of course.

7
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,239
Can we get this done quickly today, Neil? Only I've got to shoot off to a party later.

8
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,439
Shoot off, meaning leave quickly, of course we can.

9
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:40,000
And it's funny you should mention shooting because our topic this week is gun control

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,159
without guns. Is that so? I have a question about that for you.

11
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,399
Fire away then? Fire away. An expression giving permission for someone to

12
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:54,799
ask a question or speak. So which country has the oldest gun control laws in the world?

13
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,959
Is it A, the USA? B, Iceland or C, Japan?

14
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to guess B, Iceland just because I've never been there.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,039
Well we'll find out if you're right a bit later on.

16
00:01:05,039 --> 00:01:10,799
Now, imagine the scene. You are a police officer who's been called out to deal with an incident.

17
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,120
When you arrive on scene you find a dangerous criminal. Do you reach for a gun or a blanket?

18
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,039
Okay it's got to be a gun. Well in most countries in the world you'd be right,

19
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,400
but not in Japan. Despite carrying guns, Japanese police almost never use them.

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,840
Instead they rely on a combination of martial arts and in many cases where a person is violent

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,120
they bring out the futon, which is a kind of blanket and they wrap them up and restrain them

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,920
or prevent them from moving. You're pulling my leg. Nope. Listen to Japanese journalist

23
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,880
Antony Berto describe the situation. What most Japanese police will do is to get huge

24
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:56,079
futons and essentially roll up the person who's being violent or drunk into a little burrito

25
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,199
and carry them back to the station and calm them down. The response to violence is never

26
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:07,519
violence. It's always to de-escalate it. So they safely restrain the person and wait for the

27
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:13,840
situation to de-escalate or become less intense. Unless a criminal has a gun, Japanese police

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,800
never fire their weapons. Surely that means that the criminals always have the advantage then.

29
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:24,400
You'd think so, but no. It seems that guns don't really feature in crimes much in Japan.

30
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,359
Well that's astonishing. So do you think the criminals don't carry guns because the police don't

31
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:34,639
carry guns or that the police don't carry guns because the criminals don't carry guns?

32
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:40,719
Well that makes my head hurt. Well I don't know, but listen to what Ian Overton, the executive

33
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:46,000
director of Action on Armed Violence, says about armed police in society.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,080
The American model has been militarized the police, but the challenge I have is that there is

35
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,599
very little evidence that a more militarized police results in a more peaceful society.

36
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,240
And I'm very concerned that if you have too many police pulling out gun for the first

37
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,360
instance of crime, then you lead to a miniature arms race between police and criminals.

38
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,639
So America tends to militarize its police, meaning to equip them and use them as an army.

39
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,759
And that causes an arms race with the criminals, which is a competition between two groups

40
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:23,039
to have more weapons than the other group. He also said there's not a strong connection between

41
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,839
armed police and a peaceful society. So does that mean that Japanese society is more peaceful?

42
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:32,319
Well violent crime still happens there, but criminals tend to carry other weapons,

43
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,239
such as swords and knives. But at least it's a step in the right direction.

44
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,599
Now can you remember the quiz question I asked? I think so. You asked me which country has the

45
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:49,120
oldest gun control laws in the world? Is it A USA, B Iceland or C Japan? And I said B Iceland.

46
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,719
Well I'm sorry Neil, that's not right, but don't shoot the messenger, okay?

47
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,519
It's Japan, which implemented its gun control laws in 1685.

48
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,599
How interesting. Now let's take a look at the vocabulary from this program.

49
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,799
Sure. We had shoot off. If you shoot off, it means you leave somewhere in a hurry.

50
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,359
What type of verb is it Neil? Can you give us an example?

51
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,240
It's a phrasal verb, so it's used conversationally and usually in an informal context.

52
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:20,080
As for an example, when he heard his wife was sick, he shot off to the hospital.

53
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:26,960
Synonyms could be dash off or run off. Next we had fire away. Now fire away is an expression

54
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,240
giving permission for someone to ask a question or speak. Can you think of any other ways to say

55
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,480
the same thing, Dan? If I said can I ask you a question? I'd say yes, of course. Go ahead.

56
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,640
Please do or by all means. Restrain. If you restrain someone, you prevent them from moving.

57
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,680
In another sense, you might restrain yourself from doing something, for example eating chocolate.

58
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,160
Have you ever had to restrain your children for anything Neil?

59
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,879
I have to restrain my children all the time Dan. Otherwise they would fight like mad.

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,800
I have to pull them apart and restrain them. Okay, deescalate. If something deescalates,

61
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,000
it becomes less intense. This is often used in the context of conflicts or argument.

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,800
Can you think of a historical example, Dan? Well, in the 1960s, the Cuban Missile Crisis

63
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,279
escalated over a period of two weeks and deescalated only after diplomatic negotiations were successful,

64
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,839
but it was pretty close to World War 3 at one point.

65
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,040
Militarize. If something is militarized, it is equipped and used like an army.

66
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,920
Give me an example of people who have become militarized, Neil.

67
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:36,000
Yes, when I was a student in the United Kingdom, some of the foreign students had to go home

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,680
to take part in national service. That's joined the army for a couple of years.

69
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,839
So they became militarized. Now, an arms race. An arms race is a competition between two groups

70
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,680
to gain more weapons than the other group. Got an example of that, Dan?

71
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,480
The most famous example of this is the Cold War. Both the USSR and the USA

72
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,759
became involved in an arms race to stockpile as many nuclear weapons as possible.

73
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,360
