6 Nuit English from BBCLearningEnglish.com

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,880
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,439
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:19,199
In Britain, millions of kids grow up reading the books of Roll Dal.

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,320
Before his death in 1990, Roll Dal wrote over 30 children's books,

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,120
including best sellers like Matilda and the BFG.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,800
But one book in particular is many people's favourite.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,679
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

9
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,560
Ah, yes, I remember the story of Charlie Bucket,

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,079
the poor kid who's luck turns around when he wins a golden ticket

11
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,719
to the local chocolate factory.

12
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,799
The factory is run by the mysterious Willy Wonka

13
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:52,520
who invents all kinds of sweets and chocolates for the children to try.

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,040
Everything from strawberry coated fudge to marshmallow pillows.

15
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,399
Neil, I really wanted to visit that chocolate factory.

16
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,759
Now, if that story sounds familiar, then maybe as a kid,

17
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,280
you also dreamed of tasting chocolate for a living.

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,719
In this programme, we'll be meeting a real life, Willy Wonka,

19
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,239
someone whose job involves exactly that,

20
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,719
inventing and tasting chocolate bars.

21
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:19,879
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary too.

22
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:25,280
Hella Antilla has the kind of job most people can only dream of.

23
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,799
Hella is head of research and development at FASER,

24
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,079
a confectionery company in Finland,

25
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:36,400
which has been making and selling chocolate for over 130 years.

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,840
Hella is responsible for buying the cocoa beans used to make chocolate

27
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,719
and coming up with ideas for new chocolate products to sell.

28
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,840
So, my question for you, Neil, is this,

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,520
what is Britain's best selling chocolate bar?

30
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,480
Is it A, Kit Kat?

31
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,880
B, Snickers, or C, Mars?

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,960
Hmm, well, I'm going to guess that it's Kit Kat.

33
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,680
OK, Neil, I will reveal the correct answer at the end of the programme.

34
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,319
With over 6,000 employees, FASER is Finland's largest chocolate maker.

35
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:17,759
Just like Willy Wonka, Hella and her team think up new and exciting chocolate products.

36
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,840
Here, Hella explains more to Ruth Alexander

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,759
for BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain.

38
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,840
Part of your job is to travel around the world and eat chocolate.

39
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,120
That would be a dream.

40
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,879
But of course, you get the different information from different sources around the world.

41
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,400
So, I think there is a brilliant amount of ideas.

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,439
Then it is just that OK, when is the right time

43
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,400
to actually develop and launch certain type of products?

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,000
Then there is a consumer demand.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
How does it feel when you've developed a new product, a new taste?

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,159
And it's on the shelves and people are going for it?

47
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,080
It feels great.

48
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,400
You really feel proud of my team who is creating the products and creating

49
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,640
the taste experience.

50
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,080
It's really a great feeling.

51
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,080
Can you tell us about any flops where you just feel like

52
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,280
that we chocolate eaters just weren't ready for it?

53
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,040
I think those flops are as important as the products we'd

54
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,680
are gaining grade sales because you always learn.

55
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,000
Hella describes her chocolate maker job as a dream,

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,439
something that you want to happen very much,

57
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,720
but is not very likely to.

58
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,200
But in Hella's case, her dream came true.

59
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,840
After they invent a new chocolate bar, Hella's team carefully

60
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,840
choose the best time to launch it to introduce the new product

61
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,360
to the public.

62
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,879
Usually this only happens when there is enough consumer demand.

63
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:55,280
A measurement of how much customers want to buy something

64
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,280
based on factors like its price and availability.

65
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,439
If consumer demand is strong,

66
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,719
phaser starts to advertise and promote their new chocolate bar

67
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,800
before it hits the shelves, an idiom meaning

68
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,520
that it becomes available for people to buy in the shops.

69
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,719
Then it's just a question of waiting to see if people go for

70
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:18,400
or choose the new product.

71
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,800
Some of Hella's biggest successes have been her blueberry

72
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,680
truffle and the heart-shaped gaysher bar she invented.

73
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,160
But sometimes the new chocolate bar she thinks up is a flop,

74
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,160
completely unsuccessful or a failure.

75
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,680
Flop or not, Hella thinks she has one of the best jobs in the world.

76
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,280
Even if she doesn't get to eat as much of her chocolate

77
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,519
inventions as Willy Wonka.

78
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:44,799
Anyway, speaking of best-selling chocolate,

79
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:47,799
isn't it time to reveal the answer to your question, Beth?

80
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:52,199
Right, I asked you about Britain's best-selling chocolate bar.

81
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,519
And you guessed it's the Kit Kat, which was the wrong answer.

82
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,079
I'm afraid, Neil.

83
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:02,279
In fact, the UK's most popular chocolate is the Mars bar,

84
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:07,319
meaning that over 3 million bars get made every day.

85
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,000
OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt in this programme

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
starting with a dream, something you really want to happen

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,639
but is not likely to.

88
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,800
And the related idiom, a dream come true

89
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,040
when what you really want to happen actually does.

90
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,199
When a company launches a new consumer product,

91
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:29,000
they introduce it to the public for the first time.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,480
Consumer demand is a measurement of consumers' desire

93
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,719
to buy a product based on factors like its price and availability.

94
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,600
When a product hits the shelves,

95
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,440
it becomes available for purchase in the shops.

96
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,080
If you go for something, you choose it.

97
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,600
For example, in a restaurant, you might say,

98
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,760
I think I'll go for the fish.

99
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,720
And finally, if something is a flop,

100
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,200
it's completely unsuccessful, a failure.

101
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,000
Once again, our six minutes are up,

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
but remember to join us again next time
