5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,080
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,960
And I'm Alice. My chair feels uncomfortable today. How does yours feel?

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,120
Oh mine's fine, very comfortable, thank you.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,960
Hmm, well it would be nice if you offered to give me your chair, Neil.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,000
What, no chance. Well, I would be uncomfortable then, wouldn't I?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,240
Hmm, you should give me your seat, Neil.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,320
Should I? Well, now might be a good time to mention that

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,280
shivalry is the subject of today's show.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,320
Shivalry, these days, means polite behaviour, usually, by men towards women.

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,320
Though, in the past, it referred to a code of behaviour, followed by knights in the middle ages.

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,120
It was all about honour and courage in battle.

16
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,159
And only later on about being polite to the ladies.

17
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,839
Well, we aren't living in the middle ages anymore, are we?

18
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:07,280
No comment. Let's go for our traditional question.

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,039
I have a literary one for you today.

20
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:14,319
Who wrote the novel Don Quixote, about a 50 year old man traveling Spain in search of

21
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,519
nightly adventures in Rusty Armor and a cardboard helmet?

22
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,280
Was it, eh, Miguel de Cervantes?

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,519
V, Leo Tolstoy, or C, William Shakespeare?

24
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,560
I think I'm going to get it right today, Alice.

25
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,359
I'm going to say A, Miguel de Cervantes.

26
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:36,159
Hmm, well, we'll find out later on in the show if you're right or not.

27
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,119
But first, do you think shivalry is dead, Neil?

28
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,719
No, not at all. These traditions are alive and kicking.

29
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,359
In Poland, at any rate, if something is alive and kicking, it means it's active.

30
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:52,959
The BBC reporter, Adam Eastern, saw it with his own eyes and is going to describe it for us.

31
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:59,759
Medieval night tournaments, a battle reenactments, a popular across Europe.

32
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,919
But there's something about dressing up as a night that particularly appeals to people here in

33
00:02:03,919 --> 00:02:07,919
Poland. In the summer, there's events every weekend.

34
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:12,639
And here in Malbok, northern Poland, home to Europe's largest medieval castle,

35
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,719
there's one of the biggest of the seasons.

36
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:20,400
There's archery, crossbow, jousting, other horse skills, and more than 100,000 people come to watch

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,640
these tournaments. The BBC reporter, Adam Eastern.

38
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,120
By the way, what's a reenactment, Neil?

39
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,560
It's where you perform the actions of a past event.

40
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,920
And in Malbok, in Poland, they stage battle reenactments every weekend, apparently,

41
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,439
at least in the summer months.

42
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,719
Hmm, it doesn't sound like my cup of tea.

43
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,080
And that means it doesn't sound like something I would enjoy doing.

44
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,200
How about you, Neil?

45
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,640
Well, I'm not sure about the archery, crossbow and jousting.

46
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,599
It all sounds like too much hard work.

47
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,839
But I'd definitely enjoy the dressing up.

48
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:55,359
Hmm, excellent.

49
00:02:55,359 --> 00:03:01,199
Well, jousting is where two people fight on horseback using a lance or long pole

50
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:07,199
to try to knock the other person off their horse, especially as part of a tournament or sporting event.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,519
So with the dressing up, Neil, I'm curious.

52
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,560
I can't imagine you as a knight in shining armour, to be honest.

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,679
Come on, Alice.

54
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,040
I'd look very appealing to any damsel in distress.

55
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,040
A damsel in distress is a young unmarried woman in need of help.

56
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,840
OK, you might make a very fetching or attractive knight, Neil,

57
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,040
but you should get used to actually helping the ladies.

58
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Maybe offering me your seat.

59
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,760
I'm still sitting uncomfortably here.

60
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,719
Come on, Alice.

61
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,439
A knight needs to sit comfortably too.

62
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,680
We've always been the ones with battles to fight.

63
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,480
Hmm.

64
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,599
But at some point in the history of shivori, prowess or skill on the battlefield,

65
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,839
became combined with a set of conventions or rules governing other aspects of behaviour.

66
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:59,439
This included a knight's moral and religious duties and how to conduct their love affairs.

67
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,319
Professor Laura Ash at Oxford University explains.

68
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:08,639
The really strange thing is the idea that love should somehow make you a better knight.

69
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,079
I mean, this is what is suddenly claimed in the late 12th century,

70
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,400
and it makes very little sense.

71
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,920
If you imagine a footballer telling his teammates that being in love makes him a better footballer.

72
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,000
That was Professor Laura Ash, and I agree with her.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,400
What has being a great footballer or a great warrior got to do with love?

74
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,840
Well, cordially love was a social code governing behaviour

75
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,960
between aristocratic men and women that developed at the same time and amongst the same people as

76
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,000
shivori, and the two became intertwined or hard to separate from them on.

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,439
And aristocrats are people of high social rank.

78
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,920
Okay, Alice, I think it's time you told us the answer to today's quiz question.

79
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,800
Good idea.

80
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,519
Okay, I asked who wrote the novel Don Quixote about a 50-year-old man traveling Spain in search of

81
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,879
nightly adventures in Rusty Armor and a cardboard helmet?

82
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:06,399
Was it A. Miguel de Cervantes, B. Leo Tolstoy or C. William Shakespeare?

83
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,360
And I said A. Miguel de Cervantes.

84
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,120
And you were right.

85
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,920
Hey!

86
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,199
Well done!

87
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,400
Don Quixote was written by Miguel de Cervantes and published in 1605.

88
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,920
It's a comic novel which describes what happens to an elderly night,

89
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,360
who, his head muddled by reading too many romances,

90
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,000
sets out on his old horse with his companion Santu Panzer to seek adventure.

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,600
Very interesting, Alice.

92
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,000
Now, can we hear the words we learned today?

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,639
Sure.

94
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,240
They are shivori, alive and kicking,

95
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,840
reenactment,

96
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,439
my cup of tea,

97
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,960
jousting,

98
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,160
lance,

99
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,360
tournament,

100
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,800
fetching,

101
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,120
damsel in distress,

102
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,560
prowess,

103
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,319
conventions,

104
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,079
courtly love,

105
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,600
intertwined,

106
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,280
aristocrats.

107
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,759
Well, that's the end of today's six-minute English.

108
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,280
Please join us again soon.

109
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,720
And by the way, Alice,

110
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,079
would you like my chair?

111
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:05,040
It's very comfortable.

112
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,079
Oh, thank you now that the programme is over, Neil.

113
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,120
Better late than never.

114
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,399
Goodbye.

115
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:10,879
Bye-bye.
