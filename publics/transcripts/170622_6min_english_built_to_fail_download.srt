00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,839
Welcome to 6 Minute English, where we bring you an interesting topic and six items of vocabulary.

6
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:20,879
And all in just six minutes, of course. I'm Catherine.

7
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,280
And I'm Neil. Today is technology built to fail.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,879
And are we throwing away too much technology and harming the planet?

9
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:31,279
Catherine, tell me how old is your TV?

10
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,079
My TV has just had its fifth birthday.

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,839
And your mobile phone?

12
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:37,039
It's about two and a half.

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,519
So you do like to have gizmos, but not necessarily the latest.

14
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:42,399
Exactly.

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,480
Gizmo. Nice word. A gizmo is a small piece of technology,

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,079
otherwise called a gadget.

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,599
And of course, I'm not alone in buying gadgets from time to time.

18
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:54,159
They actually keep on getting more advanced,

19
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,320
so people keep buying new ones.

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,960
Technology also gets cheaper and cheaper.

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,640
In fact, many gadgets are more expensive to fix than replace.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,040
And this means that we throw a lot of gadgets away, but how many?

23
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,280
See if you can guess how much electronic waste is thrown away every year globally.

24
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,719
Is it A, 420 tonnes, B, 4.2 million tonnes, or C, 42 million tonnes?

25
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,960
And I do actually know the answer to this one,

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,039
so I'm going to keep quiet just for once.

27
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,600
Ah, first time for everything.

28
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,680
So to bring us back to our main point,

29
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,320
is technology no longer built to last?

30
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,880
Let's hear first from Professor Tim Cooper,

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,080
who's an expert in sustainable consumption and production

32
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,560
at Nottingham Trent University in the UK.

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,840
Sustainable, by the way, means able to continue over a long period of time.

34
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,960
We often use it to mean able to continue without causing harm,

35
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,880
like environmental damage.

36
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,959
What's the problem with mobile phones?

37
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,039
A classic example of this is the mobile phone,

38
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:02,239
where, for example, screens are glued into the product.

39
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,560
Now they know that if there was a screw,

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,039
their consumer could easily win a screen crack,

41
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:09,840
which is obviously a very common problem with mobile phones,

42
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,280
unscrew and put a new screen on.

43
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,960
They don't. They know, perfectly well,

44
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,639
that that would be a way in which mobile phones would last longer.

45
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,680
They don't want that. They want you to replace your mobile phone every year or two.

46
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,719
Professor Cooper says that mobile phones screens crack often,

47
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,760
and generally, when that happens, people buy a new one.

48
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,599
That's partly because mobile phones screens are glued on,

49
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,439
rather than screwed on.

50
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,640
Now a screw is a piece of metal, like a nail,

51
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,960
but with a raised twisted part,

52
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,920
and we use screws to join two things together.

53
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,879
The verb form is the same to screw,

54
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,400
and the opposite is to unscrew.

55
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,840
If you could unscrew a cracked screen and then replace it,

56
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,800
there'd be no need to buy a whole new phone, he says.

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,319
He thinks that generally, people have lowered their expectations

58
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,280
when it comes to how long things should last.

59
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,879
Expectations is a good word,

60
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,920
and expectation is a strong belief something will happen.

61
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,319
Expectations can be raised or lowered.

62
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,520
Or managed. To manage your expectations

63
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,360
means to not let your expectations get so high

64
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,720
that you then become disappointed when something fails.

65
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,520
Yes, by way of an example, Professor Cooper says

66
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,280
that his parents washing machine lasted for 37 years.

67
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,080
These days, they last between five and ten.

68
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
Yeah, and we don't see electrical products

69
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,240
as an investment in the same way that people used to.

70
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,720
We now worry that what we buy today

71
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,560
will become obsolete tomorrow.

72
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,200
Obsolete, no longer valid or useful.

73
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,320
And also, he says we've become so used to cheap products

74
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,879
that we don't want to spend more on good quality.

75
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,239
So, what's to be done?

76
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,079
Cooper suggests that if we can afford it,

77
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:51,199
we really should try to buy higher quality products.

78
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,599
And manufacturers should put labels on their products,

79
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,759
saying how long they're designed to last.

80
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,199
An interesting idea.

81
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,120
Cooper says that over two million pounds worth of electrical goods

82
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,759
are thrown away each year in the UK.

83
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,919
He calls it a throw away culture.

84
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,280
A culture in which we throw things out much more easily.

85
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,799
Not good for the planet either.

86
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,920
So, will you try to keep your mobile for a bit longer

87
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,879
or are you already tempted by the latest model, Catherine?

88
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,639
I'm happy with the one I've got,

89
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,879
but I'm going to protect the screen very carefully.

90
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:21,840
Yes, a good idea.

91
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,960
Maybe this will help you make up your mind, though.

92
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,720
I asked how many tons of electrical waste are thrown away globally?

93
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,240
And I said I know the answer.

94
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,879
It's actually 42 million tons,

95
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,920
according to a UN report back in 2015.

96
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,920
The figure could be a lot higher now.

97
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,160
And as you know, my mobile isn't very heavy,

98
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,760
so 42 million tons is an awful lot of phones.

99
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,240
While we try to picture that,

100
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,960
let's quickly run through today's vocabulary.

101
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,280
So, first up was Gizmo,

102
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,680
a small piece of technology, a gadget.

103
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,360
Smart phones, smart watches,

104
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,720
fitness trackers, satnav's, or gizmos.

105
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,000
We had sustainable, able to last or continue.

106
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,160
We talk about sustainable energy,

107
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,240
sustainable economic development.

108
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,800
The opposite would be unsustainable development.

109
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,079
And another pair of words to screw and to unscrew.

110
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,400
A screw is that little metal thing,

111
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,520
like a nail, that we used to join things together.

112
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,439
You can screw shelves into the wall,

113
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,439
you can screw furniture together.

114
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,600
And when you move house, you unscrew it.

115
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,879
Three more to lower your expectations.

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,240
What have you lowered your expectations about?

117
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,639
So many things.

118
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,639
Becoming a millionaire, I don't think that's going to happen.

119
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,240
Or I could say, a company has lowered his expectations

120
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,800
about performance over the next five years.

121
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,959
Yes, another one looking ahead into the future.

122
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,319
I'm pretty sure my computer will be obsolete in 10 years.

123
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,759
It will no longer be used.

124
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,120
It will be out of date.

125
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,000
I just urge you, Neil, when you do get a new one,

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,039
please recycle this one responsibly.

127
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,519
We already live in a throwaway culture.

128
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,439
Yes, it's pretty unsustainable.

129
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,719
Now, before your laptop or phone becomes obsolete,

130
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,600
I suggest you check out our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram

131
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,480
and YouTube pages.

132
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,760
Bye for now.

133
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,960
Bye.
