00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,160
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,960
I'm Catherine.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,839
And I'm Neil.

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,960
Do you realise, Catherine, that we are related to each other?

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,920
Don't be silly, Neil. I think I'd know if you were in my family.

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,120
Well, we'll talk more about that later in the show,

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,199
but I should say at this point that today we're discussing genealogy.

12
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,280
Well, the study of family history, and I think it's pretty fascinating stuff.

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,560
Do you ever watch the TV programme, who do you think you are, Catherine?

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,079
You know, where celebrities find out about their family history?

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,600
Yeah, I've seen a couple of them.

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,759
For example, one celebrity who was very proud of his working class,

17
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:47,759
London Roots, or Origins,

18
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,159
discovered that he's actually a direct descendant of an English king.

19
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, that's quite a discovery.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,359
The thing is, though, Catherine,

21
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,120
what if there isn't anything exciting in your family history?

22
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,000
Mysteries, no skeletons in the closet?

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,879
Well, I reckon if you go back far enough, Neil,

24
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,000
there's always something exciting or unexpected in anybody's family history.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,920
And skeletons in the closet, by the way, means secrets.

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,280
Now, I think it's time for today's quiz question.

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,759
Researching family history often involves reading old documents

28
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,799
such as birth, marriage and death certificates,

29
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,879
and these can be difficult to decipher or understand.

30
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,280
So, what's the name for the study of ancient handwriting?

31
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,239
Is it A, scriptography, B, paleography, or C, scribeology?

32
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,359
Well, it must be A, scriptography.

33
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,319
And we'll see if you're right or not later on in the show.

34
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,359
Now, why do you think most people look into their genealogy, Neil?

35
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,879
Is it just curiosity?

36
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,359
Well, Catherine, we all love a good mystery story,

37
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,239
especially if it's connected with our own family.

38
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,039
And these days, it's easy to do research online,

39
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:04,079
because many old paper documents have been digitised

40
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,280
and are available online.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,400
BBC presenter Mike Williams investigated his own family history.

42
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,479
And here he's talking about his great grandfather's story.

43
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,359
And if you listen very carefully, you can hear him rustling the real paper documents.

44
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,400
The Williams is on my father's side and on my mother's,

45
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,480
the hynno's, it's a name that we think comes from Finland.

46
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,719
And if I look at this document here,

47
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,120
it's a copy of the Census of England Wales 1911.

48
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,080
You can see my grandfather, Miss Sun,

49
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,319
and his father, the head of the household,

50
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,920
Michael Heiner, or Mikael Heiner,

51
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,480
who the family law has it, jumped ship and ended up in Liverpool.

52
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,159
What's a census, Catherine?

53
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,359
It's an official count of people in a population.

54
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:03,599
So, Mike Williams' great grandfather appeared on the 1911 census for England and Wales,

55
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,519
but because of his surname, the family think he might originally have come from Finland.

56
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,479
The exciting event in Mike Williams' history,

57
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:18,000
passed down through family law, which means knowledge passed on from one generation to the next,

58
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,680
is that his great-grandfather jumped ship.

59
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,680
Which means he left the ship he was working on without permission to do so.

60
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,240
And he started a new life in England.

61
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,479
I suppose quite a few people have immigration stories in their family histories,

62
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,479
sometimes without knowing it.

63
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,840
Actually, that's something that many people are fascinated by.

64
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,879
And has also become easier to investigate these days,

65
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,719
now companies offer to test the DNA in your saliva for as little as $100.

66
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,680
And then they come up with results saying you're related to Alexander the Great or Brad Pitt.

67
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,240
Remember, I said that we were related.

68
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,079
Well, let's now listen to El's Churchill from the Society of Genealogists here in London

69
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:01,599
who explains what I meant.

70
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,280
There is what you might call the gateway ancestor,

71
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,759
in the idea of history and genealogies.

72
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:13,439
That's normally somebody that's so well documented that their descendants are well known.

73
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,840
In England, it's something I can, over the third.

74
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,079
And we're all probably descended from Edward III.

75
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,280
Isn't it nice to have royal ancestors?

76
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,399
Well, millions of people are descended from Edward III.

77
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,120
And so in that sense, that's where the connection might be.

78
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,639
So the chances are, a lot of people are distantly connected to each other.

79
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,040
El's Churchill says it's likely that millions of us are

80
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,160
distantly related to a gateway ancestor,

81
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,399
like King Edward III of England.

82
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,000
And that means that all those people related to Edward III

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,879
are also distantly related to each other.

84
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:50,159
So it seems that paying a company $100 to reveal that you're related to Edward III

85
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,079
is a waste of money.

86
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,279
Yes, in the sense that it's you and millions of other people.

87
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,839
And in fact, we're all related to each other somehow via Edward III or someone else.

88
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,040
And another popular finding for British people

89
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,279
is to say that you're descended from the Vikings.

90
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:08,159
And again, this is true from lots of people,

91
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:10,319
so it isn't particularly meaningful.

92
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,480
If you're descended from a person or a group,

93
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,040
it means they are among your ancestors.

94
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,400
Now, remember I asked, what's the name for the study of ancient handwriting?

95
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,800
Is it A, scriptography, B, paleography, or C, scribology?

96
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,759
And I said A, scriptography, and I'm pretty confident that's the right answer.

97
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,920
Well, near your pretty confident, but unfortunately, it was wrong.

98
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,720
The correct answer is B, paleography.

99
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,440
P paleography is the study of ancient and historical handwriting,

100
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,560
including the practice of deciphering, reading, and dating historical manuscripts.

101
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,800
Oh, well, here are the words we learned.

102
00:05:50,800 --> 00:06:03,840
Genealogy, roots, skeletons in the closet, decipher, census, family law, descended from.

103
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,280
And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

104
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,839
Don't forget to join us again soon.

105
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,559
Bye.
