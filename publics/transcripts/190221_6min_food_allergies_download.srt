00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,040
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,559
And hello, I'm Rob.

5
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,920
In 6 Minute English, we often talk about food, don't we, Rob?

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,600
Oh yes, and I love food. It's a very important topic.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,679
We know that too much of the wrong kind of food can be bad for our health,

8
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,800
but there is another way that food can be harmful for some people.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,479
Yes, you're right. Some people have food allergies.

10
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,439
They can become very ill if they eat certain foods,

11
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,719
such as peanuts, shellfish, milk and so on.

12
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,640
So, Neil, do you have any food allergies?

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,840
Fortunately, I don't, but my daughter is allergic to tree nuts.

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,399
And so she gets very ill if she eats those. No, dear.

15
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,280
Well, it seems as if there are more food allergies these days,

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,120
or more people have them. Or maybe it's just in the news more.

17
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,599
Well, that's a very interesting point because that is the topic of this program.

18
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:04,879
Before we find out more though, here is our question.

19
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,640
One of the most common food allergies is to peanuts.

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,120
Now, what kind of food is a peanut?

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,400
Is it a vegetable, be a nut or see a legume?

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,719
Oh, come on, a peanut is a nut.

23
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,319
There's a clue in the name there, Neil.

24
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,560
But that would be too easy, wouldn't it?

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,000
So, I'm going to say that I've got no idea what a legume is,

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,840
so that's my answer, see.

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,400
I'll have the answer at the end of the program.

28
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,719
To help answer the question as to whether food allergies are more common now,

29
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:40,560
here's Dr Adam Fox, who is speaking on the food program on BBC Radio 4.

30
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,719
Does he think there has been an increase?

31
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,719
I think we can be very confident if you look back over say 30 or 40 years,

32
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,079
that there are much more allergic problems around now than there were.

33
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,680
So, for example, very robust studies that look at prevalence of things like

34
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,120
eczema, food allergy, do show really significant increases over 20, 30 years, for example.

35
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,240
Has there been an increase?

36
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,400
Well, yes, he says there have been significant increases.

37
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,000
This means there has been a clear and obvious rise.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,760
Why does he think that?

39
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,719
He said that there have been robust studies.

40
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,400
A study is a piece of research, and if you say a study is robust,

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,280
it means that it was very detailed and conducted thoroughly to a high standard.

42
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,120
He said that these studies looked at the prevalence of a few things.

43
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,840
Prevalence is a noun that refers to how common something is, how often it happens.

44
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,080
One of the things they looked at, as well as food allergies, was eczema.

45
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,680
This is a skin condition that usually happens in childhood.

46
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,319
The skin can get red, itchy and painful over different parts of the body.

47
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,000
Here's Dr Fox again.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,199
I think we can be very confident if you look back over say 30 or 40 years,

49
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,639
that there are much more allergic problems around now than there were.

50
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,799
For example, very robust studies that look at prevalence of things like eczema,

51
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:02,000
food allergy, do show really significant increases over 20, 30 years, for example.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,279
So what is the reason for the increase in food allergies?

53
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:06,559
Is it genetics?

54
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:07,919
Dr Fox again.

55
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,839
We certainly can't put it down to genetics,

56
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:13,039
and we now understand that there is a key role for eczema.

57
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:18,159
So there's a pretty direct relationship between whether you've got eczema during infancy

58
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,000
and your likelihood of getting a food allergy.

59
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,520
Is it genetics?

60
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,919
No. He says you can't put it down to genetics,

61
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:28,800
which means you can't explain it by genetics.

62
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,560
In fact, according to the research, if you have eczema as a child,

63
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,960
you are more likely to develop food allergies.

64
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,199
Here's Dr Fox one more time.

65
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,520
We certainly can't put it down to genetics,

66
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,400
and we now understand that there is a key role for eczema.

67
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,000
So there's a pretty direct relationship between whether you've got eczema during infancy

68
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,000
and your likelihood of getting a food allergy.

69
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,039
Okay, now time to review our vocabulary,

70
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,879
but first let's have the answer to the quiz question.

71
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,159
I asked, what kind of food is a peanut?

72
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,680
Is it A, a vegetable?

73
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,719
B, a nut?

74
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:03,840
C, a legume.

75
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,680
What did you say, Rob?

76
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,920
I said C, a legume, because that was the only one I didn't know,

77
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,840
and it can't be as simple as being a nut.

78
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,039
An inspired guess.

79
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,439
If you said C, legume, then congratulations.

80
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,480
Despite the name, a peanut is not actually a nut.

81
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,040
Rather conveniently though, we don't have time for me to explain exactly why it's not a nut,

82
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,759
but I'm sure you're smart enough to look it up yourself.

83
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,519
So you're not going to explain it?

84
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,879
No, sorry, we don't have the time.

85
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,399
Sounds to me like you're allergic to hard work, Neil.

86
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,839
Ah, nice link to today's vocabulary.

87
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,199
We do have time for that.

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,040
Today we've been looking at the topic of food allergies.

89
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,399
This is when a particular food causes a medical problem.

90
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,479
The problem could be minor or it could be very serious, even fatal,

91
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,279
and these are called allergic reactions.

92
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,639
The topic has been investigated with robust studies.

93
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,120
This is research that has been done in a very detailed, accurate and thorough way.

94
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,439
The next word was the noun prevalence.

95
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,599
This is used to talk about how common or how frequent something is.

96
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:12,639
In this research, they examined the prevalence of food allergies in certain age groups.

97
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:15,839
Closely connected to food allergies is eczema.

98
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:22,000
This is a medical condition that makes your skin dry, painful and itchy over different parts of the body.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,319
It was reported that there had been a significant increase in the number of people

100
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,800
suffering from eczema and food allergies.

101
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,479
A significant increase is a big and important increase.

102
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,399
And finally, we had the phrase to put something down to something.

103
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,759
This means to say one thing is the reason for another.

104
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,319
In this case, you couldn't put the increase in food allergies down to genetics.

105
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,759
You know what I put the success of 6-minute English down to?

106
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,719
No, what's that rather?

107
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:53,920
Your great knowledge of different subjects and skill as a presenter and communicator.

108
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,519
Well, that's very kind of you.

109
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,039
But I still don't have time to explain what a legume is.

110
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,480
In fact, now it's time to wrap up this edition of 6-minute English.

111
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,319
We look forward to your company again soon.

112
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,639
In the meantime, check us out in all the usual places online and on social media.

113
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:10,959
We are BBC Learning English.

114
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:11,599
Bye for now.

115
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:12,079
Goodbye.
