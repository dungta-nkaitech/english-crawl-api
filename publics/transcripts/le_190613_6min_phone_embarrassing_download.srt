00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,960
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,080
And I'm Sam.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,240
Sam, do you know Stephen Frye?

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,760
Hmm, not personally, but I know of him.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,640
Stephen Frye is an English writer and comedian

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,080
and is well known for being extremely intelligent

9
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:30,559
and very knowledgeable about many things,

10
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:32,960
cultural, historical and linguistic.

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,320
To be knowledgeable means to know a lot about something.

12
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:40,079
I wish I was half as knowledgeable as he is.

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,719
Hmm, I wish I were a coarser as knowledgeable.

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,320
There is still time, Sam.

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,119
And maybe this week's question will help you become

16
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,480
just a little bit more knowledgeable on the topic of the telephone.

17
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,239
The first long-distance telephone call was made in 1876.

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,440
Approximately what was the distance of that call?

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,240
Was it A, 10 kilometres, B, 15 kilometres or C, 20 kilometres?

20
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,159
What do you think, Sam?

21
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,159
So when you say long-distance...

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,079
For the time, yes, remember the telephone was only a baby in 1876.

23
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,400
In that case, I'll say approximately 15 kilometres,

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,760
but that's just a guess, a long-distance guess.

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,240
We'll find out if you're right at the end of the programme.

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,080
Stephen Fry is also known as a technophile.

27
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,520
The suffix file means a lover of that thing.

28
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,160
So a technophile is someone who loves technology.

29
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,840
Fry was a guest on the BBC podcast word of mouth

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,200
and was talking about the technology of communication.

31
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,719
It seems he's not a fan of the telephone, but why not?

32
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,120
I think the telephone was a really annoying blip,

33
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,160
in our communications, and that's old technology.

34
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,000
I mean, that's 1880s and 90s.

35
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,480
When you're on the telephone to someone, especially if you're British,

36
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,000
you know, that burning-chore thing,

37
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,400
you know, the moment one Englishman opens his mouth,

38
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,920
another Englishman despises him.

39
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,520
When you're speaking to someone on the telephone,

40
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,360
all the age, class, education, vocabulary all come into play,

41
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,000
because it's in real time and it's embarrassing.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,840
I hate being on the telephone to people.

43
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,960
Especially strangers in shops and things like that,

44
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,480
because it's embarrassing and awkward.

45
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,319
So why doesn't he like the telephone?

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,039
Well, he uses a quote from the writer George Burnidge Shaw.

47
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:41,759
It's not the exact quote, but the meaning is that as soon as an English person speaks,

48
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,080
another English person despises them.

49
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,439
To despise someone is a very strong emotion,

50
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,759
and it means to really hate someone.

51
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,719
So what is it about the English person's voice that leads others to despise them?

52
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,599
Stephen Fry goes on to explain that there's a lot of information about someone

53
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,280
that people get from their voice.

54
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,479
You can make a judgment about someone's age,

55
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,399
level of education,

56
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:08,879
and class from the way that they speak,

57
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,039
and the vocabulary they use.

58
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,439
Class refers to your economic and social position in a society.

59
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,840
In Britain, we talk about three classes,

60
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,719
upper class, middle class, and working class.

61
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,240
The family into which you are born dictates your class.

62
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,360
These used to be a lot more important in British society,

63
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,840
but there are still different prejudices and negative feelings related to the relationship

64
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,199
between the classes.

65
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:33,920
Exactly.

66
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,240
So hearing someone's voice on the telephone might make you think something negative

67
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,080
about someone based on very old-fashioned ideas of class.

68
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,120
What makes it worse is that these conversations happen in real time.

69
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,159
This means they're happening live, not recorded,

70
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,719
so you have no time to really think about it.

71
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,400
So he may be a technophile, but he's not a fan of the phone.

72
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,120
Indeed.

73
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,640
He called it a blip,

74
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,680
which is a word for when something is not quite right,

75
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,759
when there's a fault or a mistake,

76
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,080
which is usually not long-lasting.

77
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,680
So do you think he's right?

78
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,840
Well, actually, I don't like to talk to strangers on the phone very much myself,

79
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,360
but that's just me.

80
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,439
But I do think that although the class divisions in British society

81
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,439
are much less obvious and much less important than in the past,

82
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,439
we still do make judgments about people based on how they speak,

83
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,480
and those judgments can often be completely false.

84
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,120
Right, nearly time to review our vocabulary,

85
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,319
but first, let's have the answer to today's question.

86
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,720
The first long-distance telephone call was made in 1876.

87
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,080
Approximately, what was the distance of that call?

88
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:48,000
Was it A, 10 kilometres, B, 15 kilometres, or C, 20 kilometres?

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,039
Would you think Sam?

90
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,159
I guess 15 kilometres, but it was just a guess.

91
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:56,079
Well, sadly, on this occasion, it was not a correct guess.

92
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,240
The correct answer is approximately 10 kilometres or six miles.

93
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,639
Congratulations, if you got that right.

94
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,319
Now on with the vocabulary.

95
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,799
We started with the adjective knowledgeable,

96
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:09,360
which means knowing a lot about something.

97
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,080
A technophile is someone who loves technology.

98
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,280
To despise someone is to hate someone strongly.

99
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,240
Class refers to a group in society you were said to belong to from your birth.

100
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,439
Certain stereotypes are often attached to different classes

101
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,240
to do with intelligence and education, for example.

102
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,000
In real time is an expression that means happening live without any pauses or breaks.

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,080
So, for example, you aren't listening to this programme in real time.

104
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,199
Well, I am.

105
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,680
Well, of course, you are Neil, because you are here with me as we are recording.

106
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,599
But if you're listening to the podcast, it's no longer real time.

107
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,360
It's been recorded and edited.

108
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,759
And we had one other word, didn't we?

109
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,360
Yes, a blip, which is a temporary fault or mistake.

110
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,439
Well, that's all we've got for this programme.
