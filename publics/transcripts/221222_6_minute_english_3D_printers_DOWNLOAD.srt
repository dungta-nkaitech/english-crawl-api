Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Sam.

4
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:17,920
And I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,760
In 1436 in Germany, Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press,

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,640
a machine capable of making many copies of the same page of text.

7
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:35,200
Ever since, printing has been used around the world to produce books, newspapers and magazines.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,280
Printing technology has come a long way since Gutenberg's time,

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,320
but even today's most advanced laser printers have only printed flat

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,519
two-dimensional objects until now.

11
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:51,920
In this programme, we're discussing 3D printers, printers which can build

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,079
solid three-dimensional objects out of a variety of materials,

13
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,640
including plastic, concrete and metal.

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,439
Now, Neil, when you say a printer that can make solid objects,

15
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,239
I guess you're not talking about a normal printer.

16
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,519
That's right, Sam.

17
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:12,799
These large and complex 3D printers work in a completely different way.

18
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,480
Unlike a sculptor who chips away at a block of stone to refuel a shape underneath,

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,039
3D printers work in the opposite way, building up physical objects

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,320
by adding material layer on layer.

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,680
And the ability to print objects in this way is providing solutions to many problems

22
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,360
as we'll be finding out.

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,680
But first, I have a question for you, Neil.

24
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,880
Before Johannes Gutenberg invented his printing press,

25
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,080
copies of texts were made by block printing,

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,280
using hand-carved wooden blocks pressed into ink.

27
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,760
So, what was the oldest known text to be printed this way?

28
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,000
Was it A, a religious teaching?

29
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,599
B, a cooking recipe or C, a love letter?

30
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,920
I think it might have been a recipe.

31
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,200
Okay, Neil, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,079
The idea of printing solid objects is not new,

33
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,319
but it was only after the millennium that tech companies began to realise

34
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,920
how it could be done.

35
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,120
Here's Professor Mark Miodovnik, a material scientist at University College London,

36
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,080
explaining more to BBC World Service programme, people fixing the world.

37
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,120
As the millennium turned, patents expired,

38
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,000
and that meant people started making really cheap 3D printers,

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,240
and people started mucking about with them and going,

40
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,640
hold on a minute, it's not just an industrial tool,

41
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,680
you can put them in schools, you can put them in universities.

42
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,640
Oh, it's actually really great for prototyping.

43
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,160
And then people got excited about it,

44
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,680
and it became the answer to everything.

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,920
Everything was going to be 3D printed.

46
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,160
After the year 2000, 3D printers suddenly got much cheaper

47
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,520
and tech companies started mucking about with them,

48
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,400
spending time playing with them in a fun way.

49
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,680
They realised that 3D printers had many uses.

50
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,719
For example, they discovered that 3D printers were great at making prototypes,

51
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,680
models of a product that can be tested, improved,

52
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,680
and used to develop better products.

53
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,280
Professor Miodovnik thinks these tech companies were surprised

54
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,920
at how useful 3D printing was.

55
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,719
He uses the phrase, hold on a minute,

56
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,680
to express this surprise or disbelief.

57
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,200
In fact, it turned out that 3D printers were excellent

58
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,120
at making bespoke things,

59
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,319
objects which are made specially for a particular person.

60
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,240
One area which 3D printing dramatically improved

61
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,240
was medical prosthetics.

62
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,439
Artificial body parts made specially for someone

63
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,879
who has lost an arm, a leg or a foot, for example.

64
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,080
In 2021, Stephen Verz, who lost an eye in a childhood accident,

65
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,040
became the first person to be fitted with a 3D printed prosthetic eye.

66
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,439
It's prosthetic, so the new eye doesn't restore Stephen's sight,

67
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,000
but it has boosted his confidence.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,320
Sir Jean Mandi Psegoo led the team at Moorsefield Hospital

69
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,320
that operated on Stephen's eye.

70
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,080
Here he is explaining more to BBC World Services,

71
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,680
people fixing the world.

72
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,080
In many countries, particularly the developed world,

73
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,200
there are facilities for custom making a prosthetic eye

74
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,719
to match the other eye.

75
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,199
And that's an artisan process,

76
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,199
which is very time-consuming and requires real artistry

77
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,719
on the part of the ocularist.

78
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:26,079
The ocularist is a person who fits the prosthetic eye.

79
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,319
And so what we have been developing is a technique

80
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,399
to automate the whole process.

81
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,800
Even before 3D printers, prosthetic eyes were custom made,

82
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,360
a word similar to bespoke, which means

83
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,040
specially made according to a particular person's requirements.

84
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,360
But the traditional way of making artificial eyes by hand

85
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,040
is very time-consuming.

86
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,280
It takes a lot of time to do.

87
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,160
Nowadays, 3D printing can complete the whole process in just 30 minutes.

88
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,960
It's great to see technology helping people.

89
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,040
And amazing how far new inventions like 3D printers have come

90
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,439
since the days of Johannes Gutenberg,

91
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,720
speaking of which Neil,

92
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,840
it's time to reveal the answer to my question.

93
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,640
Right, you asked me about the earliest known text

94
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,200
to have been printed using wooden blocks.

95
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,000
And I guessed it was a cooking recipe.

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,200
So was I right?

97
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,920
You were wrong, I'm afraid Neil.

98
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,240
The oldest known wooden block print was actually a religious text.

99
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,480
The Buddha's Diamond Sutra.

100
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,360
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from this programme

101
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,120
starting with mucking about an informal way to say,

102
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,720
playing with something carelessly, not for a serious reason.

103
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,240
A prototype is a model of a product that can be tested,

104
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,959
improved and used to develop a better product.

105
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:49,519
The phrase, hold on a minute, can be used to express surprise or disbelief.

106
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,399
Prostethics refer to artificial body parts,

107
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,959
such as arms, legs, feet or eyes,

108
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:57,920
which are used to replace a missing natural part.

109
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,800
The words bespoke and custom made,

110
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,399
describe something specially made for a particular person.

111
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,359
And finally, if something is time consuming,

112
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,439
it takes a lot of time to do.

113
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,319
Goodbye for now.

114
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,000
Goodbye.

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,799
Six minutes English from the BBC.
