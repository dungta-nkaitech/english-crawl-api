from BBCLearningEnglish.com

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,880
I'm Rob and welcome to 6 Minute English.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,600
We've got a sweet topic today and six tempting items of vocabulary.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,519
Hello, I'm Neil and we're going to be talking about sugar,

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,839
which many of us find tempting, but how much is too much, Rob?

9
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:31,600
I don't know, Neil, but hopefully we'll be finding that out.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,320
I must admit, though, I have a sweet tooth,

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,399
and that means I like sugary things.

12
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,359
Me too.

13
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,159
But something I'm always seeing in the news these days

14
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:42,399
is that we're eating too much sugar.

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,039
And one important factor is that sugars are sometimes hidden in processed foods.

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,760
Processed food is any food that has been changed in some way,

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,159
by freezing it or putting it in tins,

18
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,879
or by combining foods or adding chemicals.

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,719
In fact, some of the sugars we eat are hidden in food

20
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,560
that we think of as healthy,

21
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,760
such as yogurts, low fat snacks and fruit drinks.

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,439
Do you check the information on the back of food packets, Rob,

23
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,400
to see what's in them?

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes, I do, but it can be very confusing.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
There's so much information.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,079
And I'm not always sure how much of a certain thing is bad.

27
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,640
Well, that brings me on to today's quiz question.

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,480
Can you tell me if a food contains 5% total sugars per 100 grams,

29
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:35,120
is it A high in sugar, B low in sugar, or C somewhere in the middle?

30
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,719
I'll say low, Neil.

31
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,240
Okay, well, we'll find out later.

32
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,920
Some food products have color coding on the packaging

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,560
to help you understand the information, don't they?

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,000
Red for high levels of sugar, salt or fat, orange,

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
for medium and green for low.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,599
That sounds helpful.

37
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,799
Then you can see it a glance, what's good or bad for you?

38
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,680
At a glance means with a quick look.

39
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,680
Okay, let's listen now to BBC reporter Rajiv Gupta

40
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,840
interviewing a man in Chester in the UK.

41
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,199
He's asking him to guess how much sugar there is in a pot of fat-free yogurts.

42
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,080
I've actually got a pot of yogurts in front of me.

43
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,680
This says fat-free on it,

44
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,400
and it's been marketed as being quite healthy.

45
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,560
If I was to say how much sugar is in here,

46
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,280
what would you say as a quantity of the tub?

47
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,360
I'd probably think maybe a couple of teaspoons,

48
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,920
you know, it's quite surprising how much is sugar in all these products, isn't there?

49
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,280
Well, there's about a third of this yogurts pot is actually sugar.

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,719
To be honest, that's quite amazing.

51
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,600
I would never thought a third of that would have been sugar in the...

52
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,159
Just by looking at it, and it does say it's fat-free.

53
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,600
So the yogurts is fat-free, which means it doesn't contain any fat.

54
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,960
And the man guessed, there might be two teaspoons of sugar in the yogurts.

55
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,000
That's right.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,680
And if something is sugar-free, then it doesn't contain any sugar.

57
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,520
But in this case, a third of the yogurts content was sugar.

58
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,760
That, to me, sounds like an awful lot,

59
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,319
even for someone with a sweet tooth like me.

60
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,680
Okay, well, let's listen to Dr Gunter Kunle.

61
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,640
He's a nutritional biochemist at Reading University.

62
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,719
One problem we see in nutrition is sort of this

63
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,159
focusing on any visual foods.

64
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,039
It was at one time it was that fat has to be avoided.

65
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,280
That all costs now it seems to go towards sugar and sugar is demonized and people

66
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,400
link to drugs and so on.

67
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,360
I think this is the wrong way forward.

68
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,400
Individuals, yes, you should have a balanced diet,

69
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,039
but it is important also to enjoy your food and not really do this extreme

70
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,079
focusing on one side or one aspect in individual nutrients.

71
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,840
So if you avoid something at all costs,

72
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,680
you do everything you can to avoid it.

73
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,319
And demonize means to make someone or something seem very bad.

74
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,439
Dr Kunle thinks that totally cutting out one type of food like this,

75
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,520
whether it's fat or sugar is wrong, he thinks we should eat a balanced diet and enjoy our food.

76
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,040
That sounds very sensible.

77
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,920
Now, how about telling us the answer to today's quiz question, Neil?

78
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,840
Ah, thanks for reminding me, Rob.

79
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,480
I asked if food contains 5% total sugars per 100 grams,

80
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:21,599
is it A, high in sugar, B, low in sugar or C, somewhere in the middle?

81
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:24,800
You said low and you were right.

82
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,360
Well done.

83
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:31,199
If foods contain more than 22.5% total sugars per 100 grams,

84
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,120
they are classified as high.

85
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,759
And I guess that between 5 and 22.5%,

86
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
they are somewhere in the middle.

87
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,759
Correct.

88
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay, shall we go over the words we heard today?

89
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,120
Yep, first up, if you have a sweet tooth, it means you like sugary things.

90
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,839
For example, my little nephew has a sweet tooth,

91
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:52,160
he eats far too many biscuits and sweets.

92
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,519
His dentist won't be pleased.

93
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,040
Number two, processed food is any food that has been changed in some way

94
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,399
by freezing it or putting it in tins or by combining foods or adding chemicals.

95
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,079
For example, the meat in sausages is highly processed.

96
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh dear, I didn't know that.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,439
I'm a big fan of sausages.

98
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,600
Number three, at a glance, means with a quick look.

99
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,920
For example, I could tell at a glance that I wouldn't like the food at that restaurant.

100
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,040
Fat free means without any fat in it.

101
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:27,279
For example, I bought this yogurt because it says fat free on the label.

102
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,480
Aha, but did you realise that a third of it was sugar?

103
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,920
Moving on, if you avoid something at all costs,

104
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,240
you do everything you can to avoid it.

105
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,680
For example, I wanted to win the game at all costs.

106
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,759
I didn't know you were so competitive, Neil.

107
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,240
And finally, demonise means to make someone or something seem very bad.

108
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,920
Politicians shouldn't demonise their opponents.

109
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,120
They often do, though, don't they?

110
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,560
