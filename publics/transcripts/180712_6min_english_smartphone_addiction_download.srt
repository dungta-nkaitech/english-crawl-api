From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,880
Hello, welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Rob.

6
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,160
And I'm Catherine.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,640
So, Catherine, how long do you spend on your smartphone?

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,920
My smartphone?

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,640
Hmm, not that long.

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,839
Were they only about 18 or 19 hours?

11
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:29,480
No, sorry, I meant in a day, not in a week.

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,520
That's what I meant to, Rob, a day.

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,320
Oh, wow.

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,799
So, you've even got it right here?

15
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:37,200
Yeah, got it now, Rob?

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,960
Yes, I should actually tell you that I suffer from FOMO.

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,240
FOMO.

18
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,000
FOMO, fear of missing out.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,920
Something cool or interesting might be happening somewhere, Rob.

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,799
And I want to be sure I catch it.

21
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,079
So, I have to keep checking my phone to make sure, you know,

22
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,880
I don't miss out on anything.

23
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,600
Ah, so we could call you a FUBBA.

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,760
Hello, I said so, you're a FUBBA,

25
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,320
someone who ignores other people

26
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,079
because you'd rather look at your phone.

27
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:07,359
Hmm, yeah, yeah, that's right.

28
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,760
Yeah.

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,799
Sounds like you have a bit of a problem there, Catherine,

30
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,599
but you're not the only one.

31
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:16,599
According to one recent survey, half of teenagers in the USA

32
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:19,640
feel like they're addicted to their mobile phones.

33
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,079
If you're addicted to something,

34
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:24,359
you have a physical or mental need to keep on doing it.

35
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:25,640
You can't stop doing it.

36
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,040
You often hear about people being addicted to drugs or alcohol,

37
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,200
but you can be addicted to other things too, like mobile phones.

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,560
So, Catherine, do you think you're addicted to your phone?

39
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,159
How long could you go without it?

40
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,000
Catherine?

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Catherine?

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yeah.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Sorry, sorry, Rob.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes.

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,079
Well, I think if I went more than a minute,

46
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:49,079
I'd probably get sort of sweaty palms

47
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,280
and I think I'd stop feeling a bit panicky.

48
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,280
Do you?

49
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
Yeah.

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,200
Well, if I can distract you just for a few minutes,

51
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,040
can we look at this topic in more detail, please?

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,960
Let's start with a quiz question first, though.

53
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,240
In what year did the term smartphone first appear in print?

54
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,719
Was it A, 1995, B, 2000 or C, 2005?

55
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,560
What do you think?

56
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,400
OK, you've got my full attention now, Rob.

57
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Good.

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,120
And I think it's 2000, but actually, can I just have a quick look

59
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,439
on my phone to check the answer?

60
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,159
No, no, no, no, that would be cheating.

61
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,080
Well, for you, maybe not for the listeners.

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
Spoilsport.

63
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:27,200
Right, Jean Twenge is a psychologist

64
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,280
who was written about the damage she feels smartphones

65
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,120
are doing to society.

66
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,560
She has written that smartphones have probably led to an increase

67
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,320
in mental health problems for teenagers.

68
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,120
We're going to hear from her now, speaking to the BBC.

69
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,040
What does she say is one of the dangers of using our phones?

70
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,880
Hi, everybody's had that experience of reading your new speed

71
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,920
too much, compulsively checking your phone

72
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,319
if you're waiting for a text or getting really into social media

73
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,519
and then kind of looking up and realizing

74
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:01,279
that an hour has passed.

75
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:03,599
So what danger does she mention?

76
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,639
Well, she said that we can get so involved in our phones

77
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,079
that we don't notice a time passing.

78
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:13,959
And when we finally look up, we realize that maybe an hour has gone.

79
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:16,159
And I must say I find that to be true for me,

80
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,719
especially when I'm watching videos online.

81
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,799
They pull you in with more and more videos.

82
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,240
And I've spent ages just getting lost in video after video.

83
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,719
Well, that's not a problem if you're looking at our YouTube site,

84
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,240
of course, there's lots to see there.

85
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,080
Yeah, BBC Learning English, no problem.

86
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,320
You can watch as many as you like.

87
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,080
Well, she talks about checking our phones compulsively.

88
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,520
If you do something compulsively, you can't really control it.

89
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,080
It's a feature of being addicted to something.

90
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,480
You feel you have to do it again and again.

91
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,800
Some tech companies, though, are now looking

92
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,000
at building in timers to apps, which will warn us

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,240
when we have spent too long on them.

94
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,439
Just deem twinge, think this will be a good idea.

95
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,719
It might mean that people look at social media less frequently

96
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,639
and that they do what it really should be used for,

97
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,520
which is to keep in touch with people,

98
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,800
but then put it away and go see some of those people in person

99
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,319
or get them a phone call.

100
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,280
So does she think it's a good idea?

101
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,960
Well, she doesn't say so directly,

102
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,079
but we can guess from her answer that she does,

103
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,240
because she says these timers will make people spend more time

104
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,079
in face-to-face interaction,

105
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,240
which a lot of people think would be a good thing.

106
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,639
Yes, she said we should be using it for keeping in touch with people,

107
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,839
which means contacting people, communicating with them,

108
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,599
and also encouraging us to do that communication in person.

109
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:40,799
If you do something in person, then you physically do it.

110
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:43,680
You go somewhere yourself or see some on yourself.

111
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,799
You don't do it online or through your smartphone.

112
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,520
Which nicely brings us back to our quiz question.

113
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,120
When was the term smartphone first used in print?

114
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,400
1995, 2000 or 2005?

115
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,759
What did you say, Catherine?

116
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,400
I think I said 2005 without looking it up on my phone, Rob.

117
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
That's good to know, but maybe looking at your phone

118
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,680
would have helped, because the answer was 1995.

119
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,480
Yeah.

120
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,400
But well done to anybody who did know that.

121
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,879
Yeah, well done to anyone who looked it up on their phone

122
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,160
and got the right answer.

123
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,320
Right, before logging off, let's review today's vocabulary.

124
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,880
OK, we have FOMO, an acronym that means fear of missing out,

125
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,720
something that I get quite a lot.

126
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,880
And that also makes you a fubber,

127
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,360
people who ignore the real people around them

128
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,600
because they're concentrating on their phones.

129
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,720
Yes, I do think I'm probably addicted to my phone.

130
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,760
I have a psychological and physical need to have it.

131
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,840
My smartphone is my drug.

132
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,320
Wow.

133
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,920
And you look at it compulsively.

134
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,280
You can't stop looking at it.

135
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,279
You do it again and again, don't you?

136
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,959
You're sadly true, Rob.

137
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,439
To keep in touch with someone is to contact them

138
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,599
and share your news regularly.

139
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:54,719
And if you do that yourself by actually meeting them,

140
00:05:54,719 --> 00:05:56,959
then you're doing it in person.

141
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,279
And that brings us to the end of today's program.

142
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,039
Don't forget, you can find us on the usual social media platforms,

143
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,679
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube,

144
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:08,879
and on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.

145
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,679
Bye for now.

146
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:10,879
Bye.

147
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,079
