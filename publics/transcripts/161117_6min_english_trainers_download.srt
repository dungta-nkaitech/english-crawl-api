5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,359
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Sophie.

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,559
And I'm Neil.

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,039
I see you're wearing trainers today, Neil.

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,039
Of course. I don't wear anything else.

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,760
Well, trainers, or to use the American term,

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,879
sneakers, are the subject of today's show.

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,560
They are ubiquitous.

12
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,119
That means you can find them everywhere.

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,119
People wear them across the globe.

14
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,519
Men, women, kids, teenagers and pensioners.

15
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:41,200
And did you know that 85% of people who buy trainers

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,799
don't wear them for sports?

17
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,320
That makes sense to me. I wear mine because they're comfortable.

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,560
They're also very tattie.

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,719
That means old and in bad condition,

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,399
if you don't mind me saying so.

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,239
I should probably get a new pair.

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,640
There's a lot of choice out there.

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,520
High tops, gel, air, classic, retro, the list goes on.

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,840
But before we go any further, I have a question for you.

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,520
What's a popular US slang term for trainers?

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,879
Is it A, kicks, B, wedges or C, flats?

27
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:16,560
I'll go for kicks.

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,879
Okay. Well, we'll find out if you've got the answer right

29
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:22,879
later on in the show.

30
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:25,280
Now, it has become socially acceptable

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,239
to wear athletic apparel or clothing,

32
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,840
including trainers.

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,959
In situations where 10 years ago, it would not.

34
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,159
Yes, I think my apparel of jeans and tattie trainers

35
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,039
is socially acceptable at our workplace anyway.

36
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:41,199
Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook,

37
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:46,719
is famous for his dressed down or informal look of hoodies and trainers.

38
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,799
You can pay anything from a few pounds

39
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:51,759
from branded trainers to thousands of pounds

40
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,599
for limited edition brands like Nike or Adidas.

41
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,159
And limited edition means something produced

42
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,159
in very small numbers.

43
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,359
Why would anybody spend a thousand pounds on trainers?

44
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:05,519
And how many people would actually recognize

45
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,920
that you were wearing Nike limited edition ones

46
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,599
rather than regular ones?

47
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,199
Other sneakerheads, Neil.

48
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,919
A sneakerhead is somebody who collects limited edition sneakers.

49
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,199
It's an American term.

50
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:19,439
But trainers are not new.

51
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,799
In the 19th century, people wore sneakers

52
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:26,399
as a mark of their prosperity or economic success.

53
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,599
Let's listen to Elizabeth Semelhack,

54
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,439
curator of the Bartershoe Museum in Toronto in Canada.

55
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:39,199
This new industrial age actually ushered in a new class,

56
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,959
the emerging middle class,

57
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,079
that was able to now have leisure time

58
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:46,719
because of their new economic success.

59
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,479
And so what they did was they wanted to sort of express

60
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,759
the fact that they had leisure time by playing.

61
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,839
But they also wanted to signify

62
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:57,599
that they were doing these things

63
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,759
by their sartorial choices.

64
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,799
And so the sneaker, in part, was invented

65
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:04,959
to meet the needs of this new class

66
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,919
so that they could very conspicuously show

67
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:08,799
that they were playing.

68
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:12,159
What does it mean to usher in, Sophie?

69
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,560
It means to mark the beginning of something.

70
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,360
In this case, the Industrial Revolution

71
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,159
marked the beginning of a new social class,

72
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,680
the middle class, who made a lot of money from industry.

73
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,920
And why were they interested in trainers?

74
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,840
They wanted a way of showing people

75
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,280
that they were so rich

76
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,439
that they didn't need to work all the time.

77
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,599
And by wearing trainers, they were saying,

78
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,039
I'm busy playing tennis.

79
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,920
Sartorial, by the way, means related to clothes.

80
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,360
These days, wearing trainers doesn't reveal much about social class.

81
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,200
For example, Mark Zuckerberg and I

82
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,240
look surprisingly similar in our hoodies and trainers.

83
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,760
You'd have to guess which one of us

84
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,960
was a multi-billionaire,

85
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,200
and which one was not.

86
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,280
People respond to current trends

87
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,680
in popular sport through the trainers they were.

88
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,520
And here's Matt Powell

89
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,920
for the US Consumer Research Group,

90
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,600
NPD, to tell us more.

91
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,880
When I first got into the retail business

92
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,560
in the 70s, the sexy sport, if you will, was tennis.

93
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,320
And we all wore tennis apparel

94
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,159
for casual wear, and we played tennis,

95
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,079
and we wore tennis shoes.

96
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,319
And we identified with athletes

97
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,040
like Mackinroe and Borg and Connors.

98
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,519
Over time, though, it has become even a broader range.

99
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,839
There was a jogging craze in the 70s

100
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:30,079
that everybody was out jogging.

101
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,800
And then that became a full-fudge running business.

102
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,039
The basketball business really exploded

103
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:37,439
in the mid-late 80s

104
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,759
with the emergence of Michael Jordan.

105
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,319
So Matt Powell knows a thing or two

106
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,159
about current consumer trends.

107
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,039
He says in the 1970s

108
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:48,399
there was a craze,

109
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:51,759
or enthusiasm, for tennis and jogging.

110
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,240
And this led to big sales of the apparel

111
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,399
associated with these sports.

112
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,399
Are tennis shoes still sexy, Sophie?

113
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,000
Maybe.

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,079
But basketball high tops are sexier.

115
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,639
Michael Jordan started that trend

116
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,159
back in the 1980s,

117
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:07,920
and it's still going strong.

118
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,480
Well, we're running out of time.

119
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,560
Let's go back to our quiz question.

120
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,840
I asked you,

121
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,480
what is a slang term for trainers?

122
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,200
Is it A, kicks, B, wedges, or C flats?

123
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,360
It has to be kicks. I'm right, aren't I?

124
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,360
I have to tell you, Neil.

125
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,160
You're right.

126
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,960
Yes.

127
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,600
Wedges are shoes or boots

128
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,080
with a triangular wedge-shaped heel.

129
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,280
And flats are a woman's shoe with no heel.

130
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,439
I know my onions, you see, Sophie.

131
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,360
Yes, in other words, you know a lot about something you do.

132
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,640
Now, let's remember the words we heard today.

133
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,400
Ubiquitous.

134
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,759
Taty.

135
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,199
A parrall.

136
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,960
Dressed down.

137
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,879
Limited edition.

138
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,639
Sneakerhead.

139
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,400
Prosperity.

140
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,160
Usher in.

141
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,920
Sartorial.

142
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,680
Craze.

143
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,600
Know your onions.

144
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,800
That's the end of today's six-minute English.

145
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,879
Don't forget to join us again soon.

146
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,360
Goodbye.

147
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,079
Bye-bye.
