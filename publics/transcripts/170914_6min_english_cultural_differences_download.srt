Welcome to 6 Minute English. In this program we bring you an expressive topic and six items of vocabulary.

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:27,760
I'm Neil and I'm Tim. So we had an argument just before we started the show. We did Tim.

4
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,200
No hard feelings? None.

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,640
No hard feelings is something you say to somebody you have argued with to say you'd still like to be friends.

6
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:46,079
We often fall out over silly things like who's going to introduce the show or who's going to choose the quiz question.

7
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,439
But we understand each other. That's the important thing, isn't it?

8
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,680
To fall out with somebody by the way is another way of saying to argue or disagree with them.

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,519
Do you know that you wave your arms around a lot when you're arguing Tim?

10
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,840
No. I didn't know I did that. That isn't very British.

11
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:11,200
I know. Using gestures or movements you make with your hands or your head to express what you

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,920
are thinking or feeling is common in some countries but not in others.

13
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,439
Then there are some movements like shaking your head which mostly means no.

14
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,439
But in some countries can mean the opposite. That's right.

15
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,519
In which country does shaking your head mean yes Tim?

16
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:37,759
Is it a Greece, B Japan or C Bulgaria? No idea. I'll guess Greece?

17
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,799
I do know that in India people shake their heads to mean lots of different things.

18
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,280
There are plenty of gestures you need to be careful with when you're meeting and greeting people

19
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,519
from a culture that's different to your own to avoid offending people or making an awkward faux pas.

20
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:59,920
If you make a faux pas it means you say or do something embarrassing in a social situation.

21
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:07,439
For example, everyday use of the thumbs up signal might offend people from the Middle East.

22
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,800
And to offend means to make somebody angry or upset.

23
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,840
Now let's hear from business professor Aaron Mayer talking about how easy it is to misunderstand

24
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,840
why some people behave the way they do in everyday situations when we don't belong to the same culture.

25
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,800
A while ago I was in Dubai and one of my students, my Emirati students, was driving me home after

26
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,240
a session and the car stopped at a light and she rolled down her window and she started shouting

27
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,760
at someone outside of the window. This guy who was crossing the street with a big box of cloth

28
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,439
and he started shouting back and she opened up the door and they started gesticulating and shouting

29
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,840
at one another and I thought wow they're having a huge fight. I thought maybe he was going to hit

30
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,640
her and she got back in the car and I said well what were you fighting about? And she said oh no

31
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,680
we weren't fighting. He was giving me directions to your hotel and I thought that was a great

32
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:11,200
example of how someone from another culture may misperceiver misunderstand something as a fight

33
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,159
and in fact they were just being emotionally expressive.

34
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:22,719
Just gesticulating what does that mean? It means what I was doing earlier waving your arms around

35
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:28,640
to express what you're feeling. Aaron Mayer was worried because her student and the man on the street

36
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,360
was shouting and gesticulating at each other. She thought they were having a fight when in fact

37
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,840
they were just being emotionally expressive. And expressive means showing what you think or feel.

38
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,920
You were nodding an agreement there Tim which reminds me of our quiz question in which country does

39
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:55,360
shaking your head mean yes? Is it A Greece, B Japan or C Bulgaria? I said Greece. And that's the

40
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,600
wrong answer I'm afraid. The right answer is Bulgaria. In some southeastern European areas such

41
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:08,400
as Bulgaria and southern Albania shaking your head is used to indicate yes. In those regions nodding

42
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,799
in fact means no as well. I hope I remember that the next time I meet somebody from southeastern Europe.

43
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,120
Okay shall we look back at the words we learnt today? No hard feelings is something you say to

44
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,120
somebody you have argued with or beaten in a game or contest to say you'd still like to be friends.

45
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,560
For example I always get the quiz questions right unlike you Neil but no hard feelings okay?

46
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:41,519
That's not a very realistic example Tim but I'll let it go. Number two to fall out with somebody

47
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:47,519
means to argue or disagree with them. I fell out with my best friend at school. We didn't talk to

48
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:53,199
each other for a whole week. That must have been a serious disagreement Tim. What were you arguing about?

49
00:04:53,439 --> 00:05:00,879
I can't remember. It was a long time ago. Number three a gesture is a movement you make with your

50
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:06,800
hands or head to express what you were thinking or feeling. She opened her arms wide in a gesture

51
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,599
of welcome or the verb I gestured to Neil that we only had one minute left to finish the show.

52
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:19,279
Is that true Tim? You're nodding your head but we should also quickly mention gesticulate which

53
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:25,919
means to make gestures with your hands or arms. A faux part is saying or doing something embarrassing

54
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:32,879
in a social situation. For example I committed a serious faux part at a party last night that I'm

55
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,519
too embarrassed to tell you about. Oh dear Tim I hope you didn't offend too many people.

56
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:43,679
A fend is our next word and it means to make somebody angry or upset. Well you've given us a

57
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,600
good example already Neil so let's move on to the final word expressive which means showing

58
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,000
what you think or feel. Tim has a very expressive face. Oh thanks. Another quick example.

59
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,600
I waved my hand expressively to signal to Neil that it was time to finish the show.

60
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,800
Taking my cue from Tim that's all for today but please remember to check out our Instagram

61
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,160
Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages. Bye bye. Goodbye.
