00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,200
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,240
And I'm Neil.

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,320
Can you do any impersonations, Neil?

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,320
Hmm. How about this one?

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,320
My name is Michael Cain.

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,280
Not a lot of people know that.

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:29,519
Hmm, Michael Cain, one of our best loved actors here in Britain.

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,719
Not bad, Neil.

13
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,280
And it's a very good way to start today's show.

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,600
We are talking about impersonation

15
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,480
or the act of pretending to be somebody else.

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,480
Why do we like impersonations, Neil?

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,519
Well, sometimes the impersonator is a comedian

18
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:45,280
and doing it to be funny.

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,120
But another reason is that we get the opportunity to meet people

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,719
who are no longer with us,

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,120
like Elvis Presley or Marilyn Monroe.

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,960
Either way, it helps if it's a good impersonation.

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,000
Yes, some impersonations are pretty cheesy

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,759
and that means bad quality.

25
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:02,799
Oh yeah, sure.

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,079
Uh-huh.

27
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,280
Okay, Alice.

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,239
I have a question for you.

29
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,159
Neil, that's terrible.

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,319
Elvis, please, come on.

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,359
Can you tell me the name of a musical act

32
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,439
that impersonates a famous group?

33
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,960
Is it a, tribute,

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,240
b, tribune,

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,159
or c, tribunal?

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,079
I'll go for a, tribute.

37
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,439
A tribute act.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,679
Okay, well, we'll find out if you got that right later on in the show.

39
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:32,400
But, Alice, don't you think some impersonators start to believe

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,200
they really are the personalities they imitate?

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,640
What makes you say that?

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,359
Well, just think.

43
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,840
Every time you appear as Elvis Presley,

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,039
you get fans yelling,

45
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:43,519
Elvis, Elvis, we love you, Elvis.

46
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:48,079
And after a while, that boundary between you and the real Elvis

47
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,599
starts to blur.

48
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,280
It must be quite tempting to, you know, pretend that you're

49
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,400
looking at rock and roll.

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
I'm not convinced, Neil.

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,159
I think Elvis hangs up his wig and moves on.

52
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,079
So, let's move on to and talk about the art of imitation.

53
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,560
Here's British Impressionist John Kulture providing some tips on how to imitate

54
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,680
or copy people.

55
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,920
Don't just say the catchphrase.

56
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,080
Don't just say, I am Michael Cain.

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,879
Say a bit more.

58
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,280
Get some gags going, some conversation going.

59
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,960
Notice the things which are worth stretching,

60
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,840
which are worth exaggerating to really give you the caricature

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,640
of that person.

62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,000
It might be a little tick.

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,319
It might be a little nuance.

64
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,000
Whatever you notice first, really.

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,719
John Kulture there.

66
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,319
What's a catchphrase, Neil?

67
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,159
It's a well-known phrase often associated with a famous person,

68
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,879
like the one I used for Michael Cain earlier on.

69
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,240
Not a lot of people know that.

70
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,280
So, John is saying that it isn't enough to repeat a catchphrase

71
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,759
or use another impersonator's ideas.

72
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,960
You need to think of your own gags or jokes.

73
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,199
And you do this by noticing and then exaggerating a person's tics.

74
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,280
A tick is something you do often without realizing you're doing it,

75
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,080
like using certain phrases or gestures,

76
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,360
for example, scratching your head or in your case, Neil,

77
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,960
wiggling your eyebrows.

78
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,319
Do I wiggle my eyebrows?

79
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,680
You're doing it right now.

80
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,759
But moving on, there is a serious and very negative side to impersonation.

81
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:22,959
Some imposter's, or people who deceive others by pretending to be somebody else,

82
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,519
poses doctors or lawyers, for example.

83
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,639
You mean without having the qualifications to do the job?

84
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,679
Exactly.

85
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:31,599
Which can have serious consequences,

86
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,799
for example, pretending to be a doctor with no medical knowledge.

87
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,359
Ah, like in that film with Leonardo DiCaprio,

88
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:40,479
where his character impersonates an airline pilot,

89
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,840
a doctor and a lawyer.

90
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,039
DiCaprio's character in the movie Catch Me If You Can

91
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,159
is actually based on a real man called Frank Abagnale.

92
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:55,120
Panam estimated that in two years, Abagnale flew 250 flights to 26 countries.

93
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,359
Okay, let's listen to Dr. Nath Talley-Gberal, a forensic psychologist in New York City.

94
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:04,479
He evaluates people for the American government.

95
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,239
Here he's talking about another real case of a woman in the US

96
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,479
who was caught pretending to be an attorney.

97
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,199
That's a lawyer.

98
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,239
The thing that was most troubling is that

99
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,879
because she realized that she was not an attorney,

100
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,240
and that she was taking people's money under false pretence,

101
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,800
there was no sense of remorse or a sense of sadness

102
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
that she'd exploited the people that trusted her.

103
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,360
But, you know, in cases where you get these imposter's

104
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,160
who specifically are pursuing financial gain,

105
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,360
they know what they're doing,

106
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,600
but they do it with the shallow conscience

107
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,280
of an anti-social personality.

108
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,960
That was Dr. Nath Talley-Gberal.

109
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,960
What does remorse mean, Neil?

110
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,439
It means being sorry for something you've done.

111
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,800
And our conscience is our inner sense of right or wrong,

112
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,600
so a shallow conscience is one that isn't very deep.

113
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,319
Anti-social in this context means harmful to other people and to society.

114
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,000
Although in a general sense, it means not enjoying the company of others.

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,199
Hmm, okay.

116
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,759
Well, I love your company, Neil, as you know.

117
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,879
Now, how about the answer to today's quiz question?

118
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:10,480
I asked, what's the name we use for a band that impersonates a famous group?

119
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,280
Is it a tribute, b tribute or c tribunal?

120
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,480
I said tribute.

121
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,280
And you were right.

122
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,240
Three.

123
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,840
Many tribute acts copy the singing style and the appearance of the group

124
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,600
as well as playing their music.

125
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,800
They often name themselves based on the original band's name,

126
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,720
sometimes with a pun, or on one of their songs or albums.

127
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,800
For example, Björn again, a famous Aber tribute band.

128
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,240
This name is a pun on Björn, a member of Aber,

129
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,920
and the phrase born again, which means to come back to life.

130
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,960
Hmm, okay.

131
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,600
It's time to hear the words we learned today.

132
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,519
They are impersonation, cheesy, imitate, catchphrase,

133
00:05:53,519 --> 00:06:00,160
gags, tick, imposters, conscience, shallow, anti-social.

134
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,560
Well, that's the end of today's six mid-English.

135
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,759
Please join us again soon.

136
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,079
Rolling on the house.

137
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,079
Bye-bye.

138
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,439
Elvis is leaving the studio.

139
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,439
Six-minute English from the BBC.
