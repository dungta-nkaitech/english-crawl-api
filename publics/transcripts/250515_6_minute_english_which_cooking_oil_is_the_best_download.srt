00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,800
Hello and welcome to 6-Middit English from BBC Learning English. I'm Georgi.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,800
And I'm Neil. Georgi, today we're talking about cooking oils and which products are best for our health.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,800
What do you use to cook with? Olive oil, butter, maybe avocado oil.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:33,200
When I want my food to be rich and creamy, I use butter, but usually for everyday meals I just use olive oil. What about you?

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,399
Yes, it varies, but I guess for East Asian food I might sometimes use sesame oil.

7
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,600
Now there are so many different oils we can use for our food and some of them are very expensive

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,000
and claim to have big health benefits. Today we'll be finding out whether these products are worth the money

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,200
and can really help us eat more healthily.

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,399
Yes and don't forget to go to our website for a transcript of this programme to read along

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,599
and a worksheet to test what you've learnt. Visit bbclearningenglish.com

12
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,400
Okay Georgi, let's start with a question.

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,599
In the UK a popular oil to cook with is olive oil, but which country produces the most olive oil?

14
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,400
Is it A Italy, B Greece or C Spain?

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh, that's difficult. I know that Spain produces a lot, but I think I'm going to go with Italy.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,200
Okay, well we'll find out if that's the right answer at the end of the programme.

17
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,200
Now lots of us are careful about the amount of fat we eat.

18
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:43,200
We might avoid fast food and treats like chocolate or cake, but lots of the fat we eat comes from the oils we cook with.

19
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes and some expensive oils claim to contain other vitamins that are good for us, but are these claims true?

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,359
Can be confusing.

21
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:57,200
presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme, slice bread Greg Futt has lots of emails about the problem.

22
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,920
I tell you what Sarah, we have had an absolute walkload of emails sent to slice.bred at bbc.co.uk

23
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,080
asking about cooking oils. Listen to Alistair in Midlothian

24
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,000
wrote that for years we were told to cook with polyunsaturated oils like sunflower oil.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,479
But now all the YouTube doctor experts are telling us seed oils are harmful.

26
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,919
They advocate consuming extra virgin olive oil, but as I understand it that's not suitable for frying a fish.

27
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,039
Also I hear that over a certain temperature olive oil turns harmful.

28
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:35,919
What the heck do I use for frying and roasting? Greg says that he's received a walkload of emails.

29
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:43,519
A load of something is a lot of something. You'll also commonly hear the expression shed load or truck load.

30
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,719
These are used to emphasise how much of something there is.

31
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:52,400
Yes and Greg uses walkload as a fun expression because he's talking about cooking oils and a

32
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,000
walk is a kind of pan. Greg reads one of the emails from a confused listener, Alistair,

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,079
who says that he's watched YouTube videos that argue that oils like sunflower oil are bad for you.

34
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,719
These videos advocate using extra virgin olive oil. If you advocate something you encourage

35
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:16,000
people to use it. But Alistair has also heard bad things about olive oil and that you

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,360
can't use it at high temperatures. He asks what the heck can he use for roasting and frying?

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,479
What the heck is an informal phrase we can use to express frustration or surprise?

38
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,000
It does seem like there's a lot of advice about cooking oils and that not everyone agrees.

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,759
Yes and some of the advice is to use very expensive options such as coconut oil and avocado oil.

40
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:44,240
People who advocate using these oils say they are wonder products. A wonder product is an item

41
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,159
usually a food or medicine that is very effective or beneficial for people.

42
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,040
But not everyone is convinced that expensive cooking oils are worth the money.

43
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,280
Nita Farouhi is professor of population health and nutrition at the University of Cambridge.

44
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,879
And she talked to BBC Radio 4's sliced bread host Greg Futt about expensive cooking oils like avocado oil.

45
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,000
What do you think, Nita? What might justify the price tag?

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,639
Certainly avocado oil is good for all the reasons mentioned. But is it worth justifying the cost?

47
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,040
If you're a particular connoisseur of the tasted brains and you'd prefer it and you have the money,

48
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:33,199
then knock yourself out. But there's lots of myths around these superfoods and wonder oils and

49
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,920
wonder this and that. And it's just all I'm afraid hogwash.

50
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:44,240
Nita says that avocado oil does have some health benefits but she's not sure they are worth the

51
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,560
cost of a bottle. She says if you like the taste and are happy to spend the money, then knock yourself out.

52
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,560
The expression knock yourself out means go ahead. But Nita is also concerned about all the

53
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,800
health claims about expensive wonder products like avocado oil. She says that many claims are

54
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,360
hogwash. They are nonsense and products are not worth spending money on.

55
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,400
Okay, maybe I'll stick to my olive oil then. And that reminds me of your question, Neil.

56
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,920
Yes, I asked you which country produces the most olive oil.

57
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,000
And I said Italy. And I'm afraid you are wrong. No.

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,519
It is in fact Spain. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme,

59
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,560
starting with a load of something, which means a lot of something. We also commonly hear

60
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:39,040
shed load and truck load. If you advocate something, you encourage people to use it or do it.

61
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,439
The expression what the heck is used to express frustration or surprise.

62
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,079
A wonder product is something that people think is very effective or beneficial.

63
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:53,759
The expression knock yourself out means go ahead. And if something is described as hogwash,

64
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,840
it's nonsense or not true. Once again, our six minutes are up. Try the free interactive quiz

00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,159
Goodbye for now. Goodbye.
