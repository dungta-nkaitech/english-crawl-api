00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,320
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,080
And I'm Sophie. What do you know about Cleopatra, Neil?

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,199
Well, she was Queen of Egypt quite a long time ago.

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,160
Anything else?

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,960
Uh, shh. Didn't she arrive for a meeting with Roman Emperor Julius Caesar rolled up in a carpet?

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,120
Or is that a Hollywood invention?

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,480
Some historical sources say she was rolled up in a carpet,

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,359
and others say she was hidden inside a linen sack.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,240
Cleopatra is the subject of today's show.

13
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:48,879
She was the last Pharaoh to rule Egypt and is arguably the most famous female ruler in history.

14
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,159
And the most beautiful.

15
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,279
Well, the jury's out on that one, Neil, and that means people haven't decided yet.

16
00:00:55,919 --> 00:00:59,199
Coins with Cleopatra's portrait on them, for example,

17
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,079
show her with a prominent nose and thin lips.

18
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,759
Prominent means noticeable, and in this case, I think it means large.

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,439
So, what were her attributes or main qualities then?

20
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,400
Cleopatra was a wily politician.

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:19,199
She made important alliances with Rome to protect her country and was ruthless in dealing with her enemies.

22
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,560
In this case, her siblings, who challenged her as sole ruler of Egypt.

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,040
Wily means clever, and sibling is another word for brother or sister.

24
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,439
Didn't she have her siblings murdered?

25
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,840
Yes, she was very ruthless, and that means without pity.

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,960
And today's quiz question is about her family.

27
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,840
Can you tell me, Neil, which country was Cleopatra's family originally from?

28
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,359
Is it A, Macedonia, B, Ethiopia, or C, Egypt?

29
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,960
I'm going for C, Egypt, the obvious answer.

30
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,280
Well, we'll find out if the obvious answer is the right one later on in the show.

31
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,640
But let's talk some more about Cleopatra's attributes.

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,879
She may not have been Hollywood gorgeous, but she spoke many languages and was highly educated

33
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:10,560
in philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, and oratory.

34
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,520
Here's Susan Walker, keeper of antiquities at the Ashmolian Museum at the University of Oxford

35
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,719
with more about this.

36
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:27,520
PooTark says that what was really remarkable about Cleopatra's, not so much her beauty,

37
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,960
as the intelligence of her company.

38
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,800
She had a very beautiful voice, which I think is a quality we perhaps underrate these days in

39
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,439
estimations of celebrity. And she clearly had masses of charisma,

40
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,640
sort of person who would light up a room. So enormous personal charm.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,840
So the Roman historian PooTark wrote about Cleopatra's voice, her charisma and personal charm,

42
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,560
but not about her beauty. That's right. And charisma is, in other words, a strong power to attract

43
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:09,840
people. Cleopatra's voice was also considered very attractive. An attribute we underrate today,

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,199
according to Susan Walker. And underrate means to place too small a value on something.

45
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,879
Egyptian pharaohs were regarded as gods. And spectacle, or making a big visual impact,

46
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,000
was an important part of this. Cleopatra was very skilled at making grand

47
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,599
entrances, rolled up in a carpet for Caesar or dressed up as Venus on board a shimmering golden

48
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,759
barge for Mark Antony. He was a Roman politician in general. And even her death was spectacular.

49
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:45,759
She and Mark Antony had lost an important battle against another Roman general Octavian.

50
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:52,080
Mark Antony had fatally wounded himself when he heard mistakenly that Cleopatra was dead.

51
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,360
But before he died, he managed to get back to Cleopatra, who held him in her arms as he died in

52
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:06,640
her family tomb. Then she decided to take her own life. You make it sound like a Shakespearean tragedy.

53
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,520
Shakespeare did write a play about it. Now let's hear from Catherine Edwards,

54
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:17,360
professor of classics and ancient history at Berkbeck University of London about this tragic event.

55
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,800
She plans her own death. In this very sort of calculated manner, a manner that also seems to focus

56
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:32,639
on spectacle, yes again, that she takes her time, she has a feast, and then the basket of

57
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,480
figs arrives with the aspenet, or was it perhaps a poisoned hairpin? There's a certain amount of

58
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,800
uncertainty about the exact method of her death. I think most sources prefer the snake.

59
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,840
So, Catherine Edwards says, the fat surrounding Cleopatra's suicide aren't clear.

60
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,840
She may have used a snake to bite her, smuggled into her room in a basket of fruit,

61
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:03,199
but it may have been a poisoned hairpin, or simply a cup of poison. But she did it in a calculated

62
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,879
or carefully planned way. Okay, so the final curtain comes down on Cleopatra.

63
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:14,639
But what about the answer to today's quiz question, Sophie? Okay, I asked which country

64
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:22,959
was Cleopatra's family originally from? Is it A, Macedonia, B, Ethiopia, or C, Egypt?

65
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:31,920
And I said Egypt, of course it is. And that's the wrong answer, Nia. It's actually A, Macedonia.

66
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,960
Cleopatra was a member of the Tolamaic dynasty, a family of Macedonian Greek origin that ruled

67
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,879
Egypt after the death of Alexander the Great. You learn something new every day, talking of which

68
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:51,520
here are the words we learned in this program. The jury's out on something. Prominent attributes,

69
00:05:52,399 --> 00:06:03,039
wily, sibling, ruthless, charisma, underrate, spectacle, calculated.

70
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:08,240
And that's the end of today's six minute English. Don't forget to join us again soon.

71
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,199
Goodbye. Bye-bye.
