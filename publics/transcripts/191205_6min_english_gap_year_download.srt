00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,280
Hello, this is 6 Minute English and I'm Neil.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,519
And joining me to do this is Georgina.

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,480
Hello.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,480
Now Georgina, I know you went to university to study for a degree,

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,920
but before you moved from college to university,

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,920
did you take a year off?

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,519
I did.

11
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,839
Well, you are not alone.

12
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,719
Many students choose to take a break from their studies

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,879
to travel or gain work experience before moving on to university.

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,759
Yes, and this is what we call a gap year.

15
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,280
And in this programme, we're talking about taking a gap year

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,719
and why doing this has become more important than ever.

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,560
But first as always, I need to challenge you and our listeners,

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,480
Georgina, to answer a question.

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,359
Are you ready?

20
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,960
Ready and waiting, Neil?

21
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,320
According to the Institute of Fiscal Studies,

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,519
which subject studied at university will lead to the highest average earnings

23
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,599
five years after graduating?

24
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,000
Is it A, law?

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,719
B, veterinary science or C, medicine and dentistry?

26
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,799
What do you think, Georgina?

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,799
Well, all of subjects that involve lots of studying, but as a guess,

28
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,439
I think those studying veterinary science end up working as vets

29
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,439
and earning the most money.

30
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,120
So it's B, I think.

31
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,560
OK, well, we'll find out if you're right at the end of the programme.

32
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,159
Let's get back to talking about gap years.

33
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,799
As the name suggests, it's a break or gap in between your studies.

34
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,280
We might also call it a year out.

35
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,759
It's not a new concept, meaning idea,

36
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,920
and there are a number of reasons why someone may choose to take one.

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,959
That's right.

38
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,319
The BBC's Smart Consumer Podcast looked at this

39
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,279
and heard from two students, one mech,

40
00:01:57,279 --> 00:02:00,399
took a gap year and the other Tom didn't.

41
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,599
Let's hear from them now.

42
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:05,919
I knew I wanted to go to university, but I decided I'll do it a year out,

43
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:08,319
and that way I can wait until I get my official results

44
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,759
and apply to university with those,

45
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,159
rather than getting predicted grades and then potentially being surprised

46
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,199
and not being able to follow the path I wanted.

47
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,599
I just always had them back in my mind that I'd spend a year doing something productive

48
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,519
and something that would just be good fun.

49
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,959
It's not something that I really knew about, to be honest,

50
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,280
I think, until I started university.

51
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,599
And it was just a bit of an alien concept to me.

52
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,439
It was something I never thought about.

53
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,879
It would have been far too expensive,

54
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,840
and it's not something that would have been able to rely on my parents

55
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,280
or family members for.

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,639
Two different experiences there.

57
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,519
So Meg said that she had, in the back of my mind, doing a gap year.

58
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,959
That means she had the idea, but didn't think about it frequently.

59
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,519
It was stored deep in her memory.

60
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,040
And she had the idea of doing something productive.

61
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,160
That means leading to a good or useful outcome.

62
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,439
And of course, having fun at the same time.

63
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,160
She also wanted to do something while she waited for her exam results to come in,

64
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,719
rather than applying for a university place based on predicted results,

65
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,640
which may turn out to be wrong.

66
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,560
If something is predicted, it's an estimation of what is likely to happen in the future,

67
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,400
based on current information.

68
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,599
Now Tom had a different experience.

69
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,960
He wasn't really aware of the gap year and described it as an alien concept.

70
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,159
So an idea that is strange and not familiar.

71
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,920
Tom also mentioned a gap year would have been too expensive.

72
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,680
But according to Chris Rhea from the organisation Prospects,

73
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,520
it needn't cost a lot of money.

74
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,680
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme,

75
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,040
he says it's about gaining skills and being more employable.

76
00:03:51,679 --> 00:03:55,359
I think the experience of the gap year has become actually much more practical.

77
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,519
Partly as I say to do with the university participation increasing,

78
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,959
but also because of the demands on developing skills,

79
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,120
specifically employability skills.

80
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,840
Actually, for an employer's point of view, certainly,

81
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,239
any form of experience and skills acquisition that you've undertaken is valuable.

82
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,560
According to Chris Rhea, the focus these days is for a gap year to be more practical.

83
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,000
This adjective describes the learning of real skills which can be usefully applied.

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,319
Yes, and these are skills that help you compete for a place at university

85
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:30,959
and ultimately make you more employable.

86
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,639
They help you get a job.

87
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,959
Right, but which job might earn you the most money Georgina?

88
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,639
Earlier I asked you, according to the Institute of Fiscal Studies,

89
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,439
which subject studied at university will lead to the highest average earnings?

90
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,920
Five years after graduating.

91
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,279
Is it a law, b veterinary science or c medicine and dentistry?

92
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,959
What did you say, Georgina?

93
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,719
I said veterinary science.

94
00:04:56,719 --> 00:04:57,759
Was I correct?

95
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,360
Sadly, you weren't.

96
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,720
The correct answer is c medicine and dentistry.

97
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,639
According to research in the UK,

98
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,560
graduates of medicine and dentistry earn an average of 46,700 pounds.

99
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,920
That's more than an English teacher, I suspect,

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,759
but that's not going to stop us recapping today's vocabulary.

101
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,720
Okay, so we've been talking about a gap year.

102
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,840
That's a year between leaving school and starting university

103
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,720
that is usually spent traveling or working.

104
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,200
When we say something is at the back of my mind,

105
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,240
we mean an idea we don't think about frequently,

106
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,800
but keeps stored deep in our memory.

107
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
And when something is productive,

108
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,879
it describes something that leads to a good or useful outcome.

109
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,360
Next, we mention the word predicted.

110
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:45,040
If something is predicted,

111
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,400
it's an estimation of what is likely to happen in the future

112
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
based on current information.

113
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,639
An alien concept is an idea that is strange, not familiar.

114
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,960
And when you're doing something practical,

115
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,439
you're doing something that is real and useful,

116
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,639
because you learn skills that can be used in the future.

117
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,720
Thank you, Georgina, for that practical run-through of our vocabulary.

118
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,040
So that's all from Six Minute English for now.

119
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,840
Goodbye.

120
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,639
Bye.
