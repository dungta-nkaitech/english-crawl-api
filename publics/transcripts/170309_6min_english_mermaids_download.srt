00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:15,280
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English to show that brings you an interesting topic,

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,280
authentic listening practice and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,039
I'm Dan. And I'm Catherine.

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,760
In this programme we'll be discussing Mermaid's as well as teaching you six new items of vocabulary, of course.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,359
How would you like to be a mermaid?

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,679
A half human and half fish. Well Dan, I think it's all a myth.

10
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,759
Well then you'll find this week's question a bit of a difficult one to answer.

11
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:39,600
I suppose I will. Go on then.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,039
When did the most recent alleged mermaid sighting take place?

13
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:47,519
Was it A, the 1400s, B, the 1800s or C, the 2000s?

14
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:54,480
Okay and by alleged or alleged you mean said or believed to be true but not proven.

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,079
I don't believe in mermaids but I think there's a lot of people who do.

16
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:00,879
So I will say C, the 2000s.

17
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,000
Well we'll find out if you're right a bit later on.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,159
So what do you know about mermaid's Catherine?

19
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,400
Well a mermaid is a creature that's similar in appearance to a woman but instead of legs

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,519
a mermaid has the tail of a fish. The males are called Mermaid and they live in the ocean.

21
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,200
I thought they were a myth.

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,439
Well they certainly appear to be mythical.

23
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,239
They feature in legends and stories from all over the world.

24
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:32,000
The earliest known one in this story dates from ancient Assyria around 1000 BC.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,079
Can you think of a more modern example?

26
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,919
Many people will be familiar with the Disney story with the Little Mermaid.

27
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:43,599
Yes but before it was an animated movie it was renowned fairy tale written by Hans Christian Anderson

28
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:49,519
first published in 1837. Interestingly a small bronze statue of the Little Mermaid has been sitting

29
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,799
in Copenhagen in Denmark since 1913.

30
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,439
There you go there's no real evidence.

31
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,079
What if I told you that over 200 mermaids have recently gathered in Greensboro,

32
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,399
North Carolina in the USA?

33
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,719
You're telling me fish tails Dan.

34
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,920
Okay I'll confess they aren't real mermaids.

35
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,319
Each person is a normal human wearing a waste high latex tail.

36
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,439
They meet to share an interest in aquatic mythology, take underwater photos and swim.

37
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,680
For many of them it's a source of income too.

38
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,879
Listen to Daniel Craig five year merman explain.

39
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,039
A lot of the mermaids we have attending here are professional mermaids.

40
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:30,799
They will entertain at birthday parties, social events,

41
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:32,400
company events.

42
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,879
I stumbled across the mermaiding community nearly by accident.

43
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,479
So it's a job too a professional merman.

44
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,560
And Daniel said that he stumbled across it or found it by accident.

45
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,039
So it doesn't really count then though does it Dan?

46
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,879
A real real mermaid?

47
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,240
That's a different kettle of fish which is an idiomatic phrase that means

48
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,560
a completely different matter or issue.

49
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,240
Well while we have no hard evidence such as a photo of a real mermaid,

50
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,400
there have been several sightings.

51
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,159
One of the more recent ones was in 2009 in Haifa Bay.

52
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,920
Hang on now that rings a bell, that's in Israel isn't it?

53
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,480
And it allegedly appeared at sunset.

54
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,640
Apparently the mermaid was doing tricks.

55
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,600
There you go then.

56
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,200
But there is no reason done to believe that that was anything other than a hoax,

57
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:24,079
which means a deception or a lie, often done for humour or sometimes cruelty.

58
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,919
Well real or not, it could be quite fun to be a mermaid.

59
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,519
I wonder what it would be like.

60
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,519
Well that I can help with.

61
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,560
Let Daniel Craig explain why he likes it so much.

62
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,079
It's just serene.

63
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:39,120
It's the perfect place for a temporary getaway.

64
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,719
So he likes it because it's serene which means calm and peaceful.

65
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,719
Yes and he says it's the perfect getaway,

66
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,000
which is a place you go in order to escape from normal life.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,080
Well I still don't believe in mermaids,

68
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,960
but I do believe Dan that you asked me a question.

69
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,079
I definitely did.

70
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,159
I asked when did the most recent alleged mermaid sighting take place?

71
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,479
Was it A the 1400s, B the 1800s or C the 2000s?

72
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,719
And I said I think it was the 2000s.

73
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:09,120
And you have hit the nail on the head well done.

74
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,520
Thank you.

75
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,039
Exactly right it was the 2000.

76
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:16,639
It was in 2012 in Zimbabwe and it was reported by the water resource minister.

77
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,200
Let's take a look at the vocabulary from this program.

78
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,520
Our first word was alleged or alleged.

79
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,240
If something is alleged it is said or believed to be true but not proven to be true.

80
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,400
Can you think of a recent example, Catherine?

81
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,080
US President Donald Trump has alleged that newspapers have been printing fake news.

82
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,760
Apparently there's no proof.

83
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,400
And our next one was stumbled across.

84
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,480
So if you stumble across something you encounter or find it by accident.

85
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,760
It's a phrasal verb and you could also say come across.

86
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,279
So Dan, have you ever stumbled across anything unusual?

87
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,279
Well there was a time when I was going to a party in Holborn and I got completely lost

88
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,599
and there on the floor in front of me I stumbled across a map of London.

89
00:04:57,599 --> 00:04:59,360
It got me straight to the party.

90
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,319
Spooky.

91
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,800
The next one after that was a different kettle of fish.

92
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,279
A different kettle of fish is an idiomatic phrase which means a completely different matter

93
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,000
or issue.

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,800
You could also use the phrase a horse of a different colour.

95
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,599
Next up we had hoax and a hoax is a deception or lie

96
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,560
which is often done for humour or cruelty.

97
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,200
What was the last hoax you did, Dan?

98
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,320
One Christmas I wrapped a broken light bulb in a box

99
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,920
and gave it to my mother as a present.

100
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,160
I pretended to drop it and the broken light bulb make a glass shattering noise

101
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,720
and she thought that I had broken her present.

102
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,400
After that we heard serene.

103
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,480
Serene means calm and peaceful.

104
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,160
The noun is serenity.

105
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,080
What's your idea of serene Catherine?

106
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,640
Two weeks lying on the beach, drinking lemonade,

107
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:44,479
listening to the sound of the sea.

108
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,279
Fabulous.

109
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,000
And finally we had a getaway.

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
A getaway is an informal word meaning a place you go in order to escape from normal life

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,959
such as a holiday.

112
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:57,039
So where's your favourite getaway, Dan?

113
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,959
My favourite getaways my yoga class.

114
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,039
I find it really, really refreshing.

115
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,039
Well that's the end of today's six minute English.
