00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,040
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English,

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,880
the show that brings you an interesting topic,

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,480
authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm Dan and I'm Neil.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,640
We'll be discussing the rise of those little graphics

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,800
we call emojis and emoticons.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,839
You know, I think emojis are a vital tool for communication

12
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:29,760
and actually they're not that new either.

13
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:30,480
Oh really?

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,920
Well, that's the perfect opportunity to ask this week's question.

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,840
When was the first emoticon used?

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,679
Was it A, 1606, B, 1862 or C, 1982?

17
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,439
It must be 1982.

18
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:44,719
I'll go with C.

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,600
We'll find out if you'll write or wrong later in the program.

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,200
You know, I think we should clear one thing up before we go any further.

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,640
What's the difference between an emoticon and an emoji?

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,359
Good point.

23
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,960
emoticons came first.

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,160
They're the images made using normal keys on a keyboard.

25
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,399
Usually punctuation, letters and numbers.

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,000
For example, a colon, two dots followed by the curved line of a closed bracket is a...

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,960
A smiley face.

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,840
Hey!

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,359
Something you use in way too many of your emails.

30
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,640
Well, thanks.

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,439
Whereas an emoji is something completely different,

32
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,960
it's an actual image.

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,200
It could be a simple yellow smiley face

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,040
or something like the dancing lady

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,400
or even a bowl of noodles.

36
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,040
Ah, yes.

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,440
All those little images we have in our phones.

38
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,880
But you'll have to convince me.

39
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,120
Why do people use them so much?

40
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,600
Well, let's listen to Professor Viv Evans.

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,000
He wrote a book called The Emoji Code.

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,280
They enable us to express emotion and empathy in digital communication.

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,280
Increasingly, what we're finding is that digital communication is taking over

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,680
from certain aspects of face-to-face interaction.

45
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,320
In the UK today, for example,

46
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,840
adults spend 22 hours online on average,

47
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,719
each week.

48
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,040
One of the reasons emoji is so interesting

49
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,520
is they really do enable us to express our emotional selves much more effectively.

50
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,159
Oh, OK.

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,040
So he used a very useful word, empathy.

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,960
It means the ability to show you understand someone else's feelings.

53
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,480
OK, tell me more, Dan.

54
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,120
Yes.

55
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,640
Adding an emoticon can show you understand and express emotion

56
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,039
and show empathy more clearly.

57
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,000
In digital communication, we lack the visual signals we have in face-to-face interaction,

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,039
as he says.

59
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,719
Interaction, meaning when people or things communicate with each other.

60
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,799
We can also interact with things like machines, computers, and social media.

61
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:31,359
Yes.

62
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:37,039
Professor Evans says 60% of information when we're talking to each other comes from non-verbal cues.

63
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,560
Wow, that's a lot.

64
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,439
A cue is a signal that you need to do something.

65
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,560
For example, an actor goes on stage after their cue.

66
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,479
And non-verbal means without using spoken language.

67
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,840
So here in the studio, there are lots of other non-verbal signals

68
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,479
about how we're feeling, non-verbal cues.

69
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,280
For example, my facial expression, my body language, the look in my eyes, Dan.

70
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,240
There's a glint of rage in there somewhere, Neil.

71
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,039
OK, so let's apply this to digital communication.

72
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,480
Imagine I sent you a text saying, I hit my finger with a hammer.

73
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,000
How would you respond?

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,039
Well, it depends.

75
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,640
Did you hurt yourself badly?

76
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,520
If I followed it with a sad face emoji, then...

77
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,240
Then I guess I know you hurt yourself.

78
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,120
I'll pull you.

79
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,599
But if I followed it with a laughing emoji,

80
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,319
the one with the tears coming out because I'm laughing so much,

81
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,000
then I'd probably reply saying, how stupid and clumsy you are.

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,120
Exactly.

83
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,400
Without adding the emoji, it's hard to know my emotional state.

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,159
The emoji is the non-verbal cue, like my facial expression.

85
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,120
By the way, is there an emoji meaning clumsy?

86
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,360
Clumsy means physically awkward.

87
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,560
Someone whose clumsy falls over a lot and drops things.

88
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,680
Anyway, you were saying emoticons aren't as new as I think.

89
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,599
Yes, I asked when they were invented.

90
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,800
Is it A, 1606, B, 1862, or C, 1982?

91
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,560
And I said 1982.

92
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,360
Well, in fact, a witty speech Abraham Lincoln reprinted

93
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,760
in a newspaper as far back as 1862 included a semi-colon

94
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,200
with closed brackets.

95
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,319
Like a winking face.

96
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,360
Exactly.

97
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,879
Although people think this was sadly just a typographical error,

98
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,840
or what we normally call a typo, a typo,

99
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,600
a spelling mistake made when typing too fast or carelessly.

100
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,280
The official birth of emoticons is usually given as 1982

101
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,040
when a US professor instructed his students to use smiley faces

102
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,200
to indicate jokes in a digital communication.

103
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,240
Wow, so they're over 30 years old.

104
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,080
Maybe I should start using them.

105
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,879
Let's round up with another look at today's words.

106
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:35,680
Sure.

107
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,920
The first word we had was empathy.

108
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,280
Do you have a lot of empathy, Neil?

109
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,560
Yes, I think I'm quite good at understanding other people's feelings.

110
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,400
My friends tell me that anyway.

111
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,960
It's important to empathize with your colleagues too.

112
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:48,479
That's not what I saw in your eyes.

113
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,399
Yes, empathy is an important part of all human interaction.

114
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,359
Nicely done.

115
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:56,479
If two people interact, it means they communicate with each other

116
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,919
and react to each other.

117
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,519
It's a pretty broad term.

118
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:03,759
We could also talk about the way children interact with the internet way too much.

119
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,599
Next up, we had non-verbal meaning without spoken language.

120
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,120
When I first travelled to Poland,

121
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,039
I used a lot of non-verbal communication to get my message across.

122
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,839
Hand movements, counting with fingers, things like that.

123
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:16,879
Next word, Dan?

124
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:17,599
Next word.

125
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:18,399
Aha!

126
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,279
That is my cue to say the next word, which is, in fact,

127
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,079
cue.

128
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,000
A cue is a signal to do something.

129
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,879
A commander could give his officer a cue to attack.

130
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,519
Or I could give you a cue to sing a song?

131
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,079
No thanks.

132
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,639
I'll stick with defining words, thank you.

133
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,519
Like clumsy, meaning physically awkward.

134
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,239
I'd have to say, Dan, you're a sporty guy,

135
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:39,359
a talented footballer.

136
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:40,559
You're not clumsy at all.

137
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:42,719
Well, that's what I thought until I broke my leg

138
00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:45,039
after a clumsy opponent ran into me.

139
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,319
Ouch!

140
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,920
Finally, we had type.

141
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,520
Oh, no hang on, that's not right.

142
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,280
It should say, typo.

143
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,240
A typo is a mistake in a written document

144
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,000
or a digital file or message.

145
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,560
Always check your scripts for typos before reading them, Neil.

146
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,480
And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

148
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,680
And we are on social media too,

149

150
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,720
See you there.

151
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,520
Bye-bye.
