2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,679
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,880
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,559
As the world switches from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy,

5
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:22,160
solar panels are appearing in more and more places and with good reason.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,920
Yes, today the world is generating 10 times more solar electricity than a decade ago.

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:35,520
And what's more, solar is the only energy source on track to meet the UN's 2050 net zero targets.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,560
But there's a problem. Space.

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,200
As the rooftops in our cities and towns get filled up with solar panels,

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,079
finding space for them becomes difficult.

11
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,240
In this programme we'll be exploring two surprising solar projects to build PV panels

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,520
in all kinds of weird and wonderful places.

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,440
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary too.

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,240
Great, but first I have a question for you, Beth.

15
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:10,560
Harnessing the power of the Sun is not new. In fact, solar power dates back over 2,700 years.

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:20,080
In 213 BC, mirrors were used to reflect sunlight back onto Roman ships attacking the city of Syracuse,

17
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,159
causing them to catch fire.

18
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:27,519
But which ancient Greek philosopher was responsible for this solar heat ray?

19
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:32,239
Was it A, our comedies, B, Socrates or C, Pythagoras?

20
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:34,959
I think it was Pythagoras.

21
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,159
Okay, Beth, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

22
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:47,359
Our first surprising solar project takes place in one of the world's biggest car parks owned by a US supermarket giant Walmart.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,480
Joshua P.S., a researcher at Western University in Ontario Canada,

24
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,400
wants Walmart to introduce solar canopies in all their car parks.

25
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:02,560
A canopy is a cover fixed over something to provide shelter or decoration.

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,879
Joshua's canopies protect customers' cars from the sun and rain while the solar panels

27
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,039
fixed on top generate electricity.

28
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,719
This electricity can be used by the supermarket,

29
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,639
or given to customers to charge their electric car for free.

30
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:24,800
Here's Myra and Noobie, presenter of BBC World Service programme People Fixing the World,

31
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,319
discussing Joshua's idea.

32
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,800
Of course, if Walmart or an equivalent retailer were to do this,

33
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,479
they wouldn't just be paying off their investment in green electricity.

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,680
They would be adding hundreds of thousands of electric charging points across the US,

35
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,400
which would make switching to electric vehicles more enticing for American drivers.

36
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,960
So we're starting to see more and more of these occur.

37
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,240
I think in the very near future we're going to see a enormous increase.

38
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:56,159
Solar canopies provide free charging points, making electric cars a cheaper,

39
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,520
more enticing option for American drivers.

40
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,719
If something is enticing, it's attractive because it offers advantages or pleasures.

41
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,879
Joshua hopes we'll see more solar canopies in the near future, at some time very soon.

42
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,000
Our second surprising solar project is quite literally out of this world.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,919
Martin Soltao is founder of Space Solar, a company planning to build solar panels 22,000 miles away

44
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,680
in outer space. With no night or changing seasons,

45
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,319
it's believed that solar panels in space would generate 13 times as much electricity as on Earth.

46
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,759
Martin's plans sound like science fiction and haven't been tried out yet.

47
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,679
But the idea of solar power from space has existed since the 1960s,

48
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:50,239
as Martin explained to BBC World Service programme People Fixing the World.

49
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,679
And then in really the late 60s, the American scientist Peter Clasier,

50
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:59,840
designed the first technical, technically practical system.

51
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,639
And after that NASA studied it on and off right through the decades.

52
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:10,239
And so it's really only in the last six or seven years that it's actually now become

53
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,560
economically feasible. And so the whole cost of getting things into space has tumbled by over 90%.

54
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,399
NASA has studied the idea of putting solar panels in space on and off,

55
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,479
meaning occasionally or from time to time since the 1960s.

56
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,360
Recently, the costs of travelling to space have tumbled, decreased quickly and in a short time,

57
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,520
making Martin's idea for space solar panels economically feasible.

58
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,759
If a business plan is economically feasible, the economic advantages achieved are greater

59
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,759
than the economic costs. It seems that a good idea is a good idea, whether it's thousands of years

60
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,280
ago or in the near future. With that, it's time to reveal the answer to my question.

61
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,199
Yes, you asked me which famous ancient Greek philosopher used the power of the sun to

62
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,120
destroy enemy room and ships in 213 BC. I said it was Pythagoras.

63
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,439
Which was, I'm afraid to say, the wrong answer, Beth. It was actually Archimedes who used

64
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:19,599
parabolic mirrors to burn the enemy's wooden ships at Syracuse, a trick which school children

65
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:24,240
still do today using a magnifying glass and sun beams to make fire.

66
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,279
Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this program, starting with

67
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:34,959
canopy, a cover that's fixed over an object to shelter or decorate it.

68
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:40,399
The adjective enticing means attractive because of the advantages or benefits it offers.

69
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:46,959
In the near future, it means very soon. The phrase on and off means occasionally or from time to time.

70
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:53,119
If the cost or price of something has tumbled, it's decreased quickly in a short time.

71
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,959
And finally, if a business plan is economically feasible, the economic advantages achieved

72
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:04,959
will be greater than the economic costs. Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now.

73
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,959
Bye.
