Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam and I'm Georgina.

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,199
In this program, we'll take a look at the sensitive issue of sexual violence.

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,960
At the start of the decade, no one knew that the two word phrase

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,280
Me Too would go viral or spread quickly and widely on the internet through social media.

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,760
But when explosive allegations against Hollywood movie producer Harvey Weinstein

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,000
made headlines in 2017, the Me Too hashtag became the focus for a global movement of women

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,840
determined to expose the truth about abusive sexual behaviour. Weinstein was found guilty

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,280
and given a 23-year prison sentence. But the deeper reasons behind the problem

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:02,480
in America and worldwide have not disappeared. I have a question now about the origin of the Me Too

11
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,320
expression. Although the Me Too message went viral due to public support from famous Hollywood

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:15,040
actresses, the phrase itself was thought up years earlier by a civil rights activist to run a

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,719
book. What year did she first use it? Was it A, 1996, B, 2006, or C, 2016?

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,880
I'll guess B, 2006. Okay Georgina, we'll come back to that later. Now more about Toronto

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,960
Burke. Yes, Toronto worked with marginalized women in neglected American communities,

16
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,000
shocking numbers of whom were victims of sexual violence and abuse. Here she is talking

17
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:50,400
with the BBC World Services Program Hard Talk about how the Me Too movement continues to speak up

18
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:57,120
for voiceless women and girls. The beauty I think and the magic of Me Too is that it's a

19
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:03,760
unifier in that way and it's where survivors find community and so definitely the mainstream media

20
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:09,920
kept the focus on the actresses and Hollywood and that but at its core the women who came forward

21
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,920
were really no different than those girls who I served in the communities 10 years before.

22
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:22,400
Toronto doesn't call the girls and women who were abused victims. Instead she prefers the term

23
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,879
survivors, people who are able to carry on with their life successfully despite very unpleasant

24
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,960
experiences which still affect them. The Me Too movement went viral when several famous movie

25
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:41,680
actresses came forward offered to give information about sexual harassment. While these Hollywood actresses

26
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,240
were famous celebrities most survivors of sexual violence are ordinary women, living ordinary lives.

27
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:55,120
That's why Toronto calls the Me Too movement a unifier, something that unites and brings people

28
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,319
together in this case women of different race and social background. But while the media focused

29
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,240
on particular people, Weinstein and several actresses in the movie industry, Toronto is clear that

30
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:14,960
the problem is bigger than just individual cases. Here she is explaining about the wider reasons behind

31
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:22,800
the Me Too movement. We can talk about Harvey Weinstein at nauseam but we also have to talk about

32
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,200
what are the structures that were in place that allowed a Harvey Weinstein to thrive. If you're

33
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,840
going to talk about Harvey Weinstein being successful then we have to also talk about capitalism,

34
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,800
right? Because it's the it's the love of money and the desire for people to have money and what

35
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,400
he represented. The bottom line is people value those things more than they value the humanity of

36
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,000
the women that he was destroying their lives. It's about power and it's about privilege. At the end

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,160
of the day these are the two things that we have to talk about dismantling. According to Toronto,

38
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:00,000
the behavior of abusers like Weinstein was not challenged or questioned because of their privilege.

39
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,480
Power and advantage held by a small group of people, usually because of their high social position,

40
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,160
or because they are rich. So rather than focusing on individual cases,

41
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,040
it's male dominated social structures like privilege that need dismantling,

42
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,800
breaking up or being stopped from working by gradually reducing its power over a period of time.

43
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:30,160
Toronto knows the problem won't disappear overnight, but she believes the Me Too movement has opened

44
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,280
up a space to talk about sexual violence in a new way and set out a pathway forward.

45
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:43,439
Let's go back to the quiz question. I asked you what year the two-word expression Me Too was used.

46
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:53,519
Was it A1996, B2006 or C2016 and you said? Yes, I said it was B2006.

47
00:04:54,559 --> 00:05:00,319
Well done, Latina, you are absolutely right. Today we've been talking about the hashtag Me Too

48
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,599
movement which went viral in 2017, meaning it spread quickly on the internet.

49
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,639
The name Me Too was created by Terana Burke, an activist who works with sexual abuse survivors.

50
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,120
People who experience abuse but are able to carry on with their lives successfully.

51
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:24,800
In 2017, many of these survivors came forward, offered to give information about sexual harassment

52
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,560
in Hollywood. And these actresses were supported by millions of women and men across the world,

53
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,240
making the Me Too movement an important cultural unifier, something that unites and brings people

54
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,879
together. Now the movement wants to shift the focus away from individual cases and onto social

55
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:49,199
structures of privilege, power and advantage held by a small group of people, usually because

56
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,879
of their wealth or high social class. And according to Terana, it is these social structures and

57
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,639
attitudes which need to be dismantled, stop from working by gradually reducing their power over time.

58
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,399
And that's all we have time for today. Join us again soon here at 6 Minute English for more
