Hello, I'm Rob and this is 6 Minute English,

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,199
a programme that brings you an interesting topic,

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,400
authentic listening practice and some vocabulary

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,800
to help you improve your language skills.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,240
Joining me today is Neil.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,760
Hello and today we're discussing those pilotless aircraft

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,560
that we seem to be hearing and reading a lot about at the moment.

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,320
Ah, you mean drones.

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,480
And yes, they are in the news quite often for good and bad reasons.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,359
They've been used for many things from smuggling drugs,

13
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,079
detecting water leaks and surveillance.

14
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,160
And surveillance, that means the act of carefully watching someone

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,320
or something, perhaps a criminal.

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,160
But also it means spying, maybe on me and you, Rob.

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,520
So should we be welcoming the rise of the use of drones?

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,240
Well, before I discussion about that takes off,

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,359
we need to set today's question for you to answer Neil.

20
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,920
What are you droning on about, Rob?

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,840
And by that, I don't mean flying a drone.

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,040
I mean talking too much in a very boring way.

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,600
Thanks, Neil. Now just answer this, will you?

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,760
Drones are sometimes also referred to as UAVs.

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,480
So what does UAV stand for?

26
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,560
Is it a, unidentified aerial vehicle?

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,480
Be unmanned aerial vehicle or see unaided aircraft vehicle?

28
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,079
Well, I'm going to go for be unmanned aerial vehicle.

29
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,280
Okay, well, we'll see if you're right later on.

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,320
Now let's talk more about drones, which apparently seem to be everywhere now.

31
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,719
But are they safe and are they necessary?

32
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,240
I've heard about them being hazard to aircraft because they've been flown close to airports.

33
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,760
Well, figures in 2016 showed that in the UK,

34
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,880
there were 70 near-missies involving drones,

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,359
and that's more than double the year before.

36
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,800
So that is a little worrying.

37
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,400
Yes, and there's the potential risk of people's privacy being invaded when a drone is flown over

38
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,719
their property, with a camera attached to it.

39
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,360
Oh, but those cameras are also good at capturing some great aerial footage.

40
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,040
That's the film recording of the view from above the ground.

41
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,719
So they're not all bad, and Dr. Yogi Patel would agree.

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,520
She is CEO of Blue Bear, which supplies unmanned planes and drones.

43
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,840
Here she is speaking about drones on the BBC's Woman's Hour programme.

44
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,560
They have the potential to be dangerous, agreed.

45
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,599
They also have, though, on the flip side, the ability to be a game-changer in both domestic use

46
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,199
and in military use.

47
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,000
So some of our drones are being used for aircraft inspections.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,759
We've put our drones into Fukushima.

49
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,599
So there you go, Neil.

50
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,719
There are many useful things drones can do, and Dr. Patel said they have the ability to be a game-changer.

51
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,519
And by that, you mean something that completely changes the way something's done or thought about?

52
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:06,479
Yes. Her company has used drones to inspect the inside of the damaged Fukushima nuclear power station in Japan.

53
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,840
And another example of drones being a game-changer is UNICEF and the Malawi and government

54
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,959
testing drones for carrying medical supplies.

55
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,680
This could help save lives in remote places.

56
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,600
And I've read that in Australia, lifeguards are using drones to help rescue

57
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,920
swimmers who get in trouble in the sea.

58
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,200
And have you heard about a Japanese firm that's planning to use a drone to force employees

59
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,319
out of their offices by playing music at them if they stay to work evening overtime?

60
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,080
I haven't, but you've convinced me.

61
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,360
It seems like the sky's the limit for the uses of drones.

62
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,439
I mean, there's no limit to what they can do.

63
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:46,000
But I am a little concerned about how they're regulated or controlled.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,759
Well, Dr. Yogi Patel says because the technology is new,

65
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,759
regulations or legal controls are developing all the time.

66
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,639
As technology progresses, regulation and operational use needs to then be harmonised with it.

67
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,560
And we are, as a community, going through that whole process of saying,

68
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,039
what is proportionate and appropriate regulation to go with different uses of drones?

69
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,519
So she talked about regulations being harmonised as technology progresses.

70
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,599
So I think she means making regulations suitable and appropriate for what the drones are being used for.

71
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:25,920
So they need some control, but not so they can't be useful and effective.

72
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,879
Like flying drones to stop you working late.

73
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,839
Now Rob, I'm dying to know what the other name for a drone is.

74
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,120
Okay, well, let me tell you.

75
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,719
So earlier, I asked you, what does UAV stand for?

76
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:39,839
Was it an identified aerial vehicle?

77
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:45,119
B. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle or C. Unaded Aircraft Vehicle.

78
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:48,159
And I said B. Was that correct?

79
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:51,519
Yes, Neil. You know your drones. That's correct. Well done.

80
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,559
UAVs or drones have been around for quite a while in different forms.

81
00:04:56,559 --> 00:05:02,559
It's thought they were first used for providing practice targets for training military personnel.

82
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:06,799
Okay, Neil, let's quickly go over some of the vocabulary we have mentioned today,

83
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:08,799
starting with surveillance.

84
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,160
The police kept the jewelry shop under surveillance because they had a tip-off about a robbery.

85
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,960
So that means carefully watching someone or something,

86
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,680
usually to try to stop something illegal.

87
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,720
Then we mentioned aerial footage. That's film recording made from the sky.

88
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,360
The aerial footage on TV of the Dolphin Swimming was spectacular.

89
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,759
Yes, drones have been a game changer for wildlife programs on TV.

90
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,240
That means something that completely changes the way something is done or thought about.

91
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,759
We also mentioned the phrase the sky is the limit,

92
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,680
meaning there's no limit to something.

93
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,360
The sky is the limit to what professional footballers can earn these days.

94
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,920
Then we discussed harmonized. That describes two things being suitable for each other

95
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,080
to allow them to work properly.

96
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,840
The garden has been designed to harmonize with the natural landscape.

97
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,879
Very useful vocabulary, Neil.

98
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,560
But let's stop droning on.

99
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,280
And that means talking too much in a boring way.

100
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:10,159
And remind everyone to check out our YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.

101
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:13,839
And of course our website at bbclearningenglish.com.

102
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,599
See you next time. Goodbye. Goodbye.
