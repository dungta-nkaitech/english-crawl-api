From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,960
Hello and welcome to Six Minute English.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,199
I'm Neil and joining me today is Dan, who is looking very jolly.

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,960
Of course I'm looking jolly, meaning happy and smiley.

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,960
It's my favourite time of the year.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,120
Ah, yes, all that food, all those presents, all that fun.

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,200
Forget the food and fun, Christmas is all about the presents.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,399
Hmm, I'm not sure that's quite the spirit, the real meaning of something.

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,640
Well, Neil, I was actually talking about giving presents, not getting them.

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,640
Ah, sorry Dan, I misjudged you.

14
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:50,560
As you enjoy giving presents so much, I'm very pleased to have you with me in this Six Minute English.

15
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,159
Our topic, what makes the perfect Santa?

16
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,960
We'll have six items of vocabulary for you and of course our quiz question.

17
00:00:59,279 --> 00:01:00,399
Are you ready?

18
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,439
Hit me.

19
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:02,799
Okay, here we go.

20
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,439
How many Santa's are there in the world?

21
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,920
Is it A, 1,500?

22
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,200
B, 15,000 or C, 15 million?

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,519
Well, I know there are a lot, but 15 million must be wrong.

24
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,719
1,500 seems too few, so I'll go for 15,000.

25
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,239
Well, we'll see if you're right at the end of the programme.

26
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,679
Now, Dan, you seem like a strong candidate for a job as Santa.

27
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:32,560
Have you considered it?

28
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,319
I'd love to.

29
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,119
A candidate is a person competing for a job.

30
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,519
And what do you think is a key part of being Santa, or Father Christmas, as we also called him in the UK?

31
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,840
As you said, being jolly.

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,439
That's right.

33
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,000
And let's listen now to James Lovell, who runs a Santa school at his company,

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,679
Ministry of Fun in London.

35
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:55,519
What does he say is the key?

36
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,919
A perfect ho ho ho is a key part of being a Father Christmas.

37
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:06,719
So, ho ho ho, and it needs to just reinforce the fact that you are the jollyest person on the planet.

38
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,959
So, I like to reach down into my tummy, tap it, and with a big smile on my face, go, ho ho ho ho!

39
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,079
The perfect ho ho ho.

40
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:20,560
You need that to reinforce the fact you are the jollyest person in the world.

41
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,079
To reinforce means to make something stronger.

42
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,400
Ho ho ho ho!

43
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,640
Wow, Dan, you're very convincing. Are you sure you've never done this before?

44
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,480
I haven't, but I want to.

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,360
It feels good.

46
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,520
Ho ho ho!

47
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,200
It could be the ideal career move for you, Dan.

48
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,560
But, you know what, I bet it's not all fun.

49
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,960
Hmm, maybe not.

50
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,040
I think there would be a lot of pressure to perform.

51
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,480
Pressure is the feeling of worry you can get when you're expected to deal with a difficult situation.

52
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,280
Yes, think of all the children you have to impress.

53
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,239
Pressure indeed.

54
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:00,560
Now let's hear from James Lovell again who runs a Santa school in London.

55
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,120
The portraying Father Christmas is not an easy job because when you're dressed as Father Christmas

56
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,120
you have a huge responsibility to recreate the magic of the real Santa in every way.

57
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,399
You need to look good, you need to have lots to say, I need to be incredibly jolly,

58
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:16,079
and you need to have magical eyes.

59
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:18,000
So it seems I was right.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,679
Portraying Father Christmas is not an easy job.

61
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,480
Portraying meaning playing the part of.

62
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,760
Why can actor does?

63
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,200
He says there's a huge responsibility to recreate the magic of the real Santa.

64
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,240
To recreate means to make something exist again.

65
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,800
All those kids expecting that magical moment, and it's all down to you as Santa.

66
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,879
Hmm, I'm beginning to have second thoughts about this career change.

67
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,560
Uh, could you handle the pressure?

68
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,920
I'm not sure I could.

69
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,120
Portraying Father Christmas might be a challenge too far, despite my Ho Ho Ho.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,800
Now it's time to find out the answer to our quiz question.

71
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,599
I asked how many Santa's there are in the world?

72
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:05,040
A, 1500, B, 15,000, C, 15 million.

73
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,000
And I said B, 15,000.

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,719
And you were wrong.

75
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,960
I'm afraid it was a trick question.

76
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,520
There is of course only one Santa.

77
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,519
Ah, that's not fair.

78
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,240
Sorry.

79
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,360
Shall we have a recap of the vocabulary?

80
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,800
Yes, please.

81
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,240
That would make me jolly again.

82
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,120
jolly, meaning happy and smiley.

83
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,280
What makes you jolly, Dan?

84
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,480
Christmas, of course.

85
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,439
Now, Neil, I have to say, cheating me out of that quiz question was really not in the spirit

86
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,960
of six-minute English.

87
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,560
We're always nice to each other.

88
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Ah, yes, you're probably right.

89
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,600
Spirit here has the sense of something's real meaning.

90
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,680
The spirit of six-minute English is friendly educational fun,

91
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,280
not cheating your colleagues.

92
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:53,119
Glad we've got that straight.

93
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,879
Our next word is candidate.

94
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,799
Until you made me think about how hard it is to be a good Santa,

95
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,839
I thought I'd be a strong candidate for the job.

96
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,479
A candidate is a person competing for a job.

97
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,519
Next, we had reinforce.

98
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:10,559
Reinforce means to make something stronger.

99
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:16,079
Repeating the vocabulary in six-minute English reinforces your ability to remember it.

100
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:16,879
That's right.

101
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:19,839
And it puts you under less pressure when you're speaking English

102
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:21,839
if you have a good range of vocabulary.

103
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,839
Pressure is the feeling of worry you can get when you're expected to deal with a difficult situation,

104
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:29,359
like pretending to be Santa.

105
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,759
Yes, there's lots of pressure involved in portraying somebody else.

106
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,439
Portraying, meaning playing the part of someone, like an actor does.

107
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,759
It can be very difficult to get it right.

108
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,439
Yep, it's a real skill to be able to recreate the look and character of another person.

109
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,879
Recreate, meaning to make something exist again.

110
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,000
Well, we'll try our best to recreate a positive learning experience for you all next time

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,959
on six-minute English.

112
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,639
Until then, don't forget to check out our YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.

113
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,839

114
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,800
Goodbye.

115
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,439
Goodbye.

116
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,639
Ho, ho, ho!
