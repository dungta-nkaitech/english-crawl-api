From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,719
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

6
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:17,359
I'm Neil.

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,240
And I'm Sam.

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,640
In this program, we'll be looking at some of the many dangers facing humanity,

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,920
from climate change and global pandemics to asteroid impacts and nuclear war.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,079
We'll be finding out whether human civilization can survive these risks

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,960
and looking at some of the related vocabulary as well.

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,600
Do you really think humans could become extinct and end up as dead as the dodo?

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,000
Ah, so of course you've heard of the dodo.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yeah, dodo's were large mesa hybers, which died out in the 1600s,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,200
after being hunted to extinction by humans.

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,400
That's right, dodo's couldn't fly and weren't very clever.

17
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,719
They didn't hide when sailors with hunting dogs landed on their island.

18
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,679
The species was hunted so much that within a century,

19
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:03,839
every single bird had died out.

20
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:06,640
But do you know which island the dodo was from, Sam?

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,400
That's my quiz question for today.

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,319
Was it A, the Galapagos?

23
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,200
B, Mauritius or C, Fiji?

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,680
I'll guess the Galapagos, Neil, because I know many exotic animals live there.

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,840
By the way, that's also cheered me up a bit, because as humans,

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,240
we are much smarter than the dodo.

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,880
We're far too clever to die out, aren't we?

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,640
Hmm, I'm not so sure I agree, Sam.

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,280
Lots of the existential risks, the worst possible things that could happen to humanity,

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,520
such as nuclear war, global pandemics, or rogue artificial intelligence, are human made.

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,280
These threats could have catastrophic consequences for human survival in the 21st century.

32
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,480
Yeah, that's true.

33
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,280
But existential risks don't only threaten the survival of the human species.

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,840
Instead, they could destroy civilization as we know it, leaving pockets of survivors to struggle on

35
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,079
in a post-apocalyptic world.

36
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,439
And it wouldn't be the first time that that has happened,

37
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,199
as the BBC World Service Program, The Inquiry, found out.

38
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:15,920
Simon Beard of the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at Cambridge University, explains.

39
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,919
Historical records suggest that about once every thousand years, an event occurs that

40
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,959
wipes out about a third of the human population.

41
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,679
So in the Middle Ages, this was the Black Death huge plague that covered Eurasia,

42
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:35,679
or there was also dramatic global calling at that time, which many people think was

43
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:39,679
related to volcanic eruptions, and about a third of the global population died.

44
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,079
So, humanity has been facing these risks throughout history,

45
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,480
according to the historical record.

46
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,520
The collection of all written and recorded past events concerning the human race.

47
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,200
Yes, wars and plagues, infectious epidemic diseases, which spread between countries,

48
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,120
can quickly wipe out or completely destroy millions of people.

49
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,960
Yeah, and there's not much we can do to stop disasters like that.

50
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,920
True Sam, but what about individuals who actively work to bring about the end of the world,

51
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:15,359
like apocalyptic terrorists, rampage shooters, fundamentalist cults,

52
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:19,439
like those who organize the poisonous gas attack on the Tokyo subway?

53
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,719
Those are people who want to end human life on Earth and bring about Doomsday,

54
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,959
another word for the final apocalyptic day of the world's existence.

55
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,479
Right, and things got even scarier in modern times with the invention of nuclear weapons.

56
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:39,039
During the Cuban Missile Crisis between America and the USSR, for example,

57
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:45,039
risk experts estimated a 41% probability that human life would be completely wiped out.

58
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:51,759
Seth Baum of New York's Global Catastrophic Risk Institute explains how human error

59
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,840
almost brought about Doomsday.

60
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,599
There are some ways that you could get to a nuclear war without really intending to.

61
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:06,879
And probably the biggest example is if you have a false alarm that is mistaken as a nuclear attack.

62
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,479
And there have been a number of maybe even very serious false alarms over the years,

63
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,759
in which one side of the other genuinely believed that they were under nuclear attack when,

64
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,000
in fact, they were not at all under nuclear attack.

65
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:26,399
One such false alarm, an incorrect warning given so that people wrongly believe something

66
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:33,439
dangerous is about to happen, came about in 1995 when the US sent missiles up into the Earth's

67
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,759
atmosphere to study the aurora borealis, the Northern Lights.

68
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,199
Soviet radars picked up the missiles, thinking they were nuclear warheads and almost retaliated.

69
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:49,360
Nuclear Armageddon was only averted by the actions of one clear thinking Russian general

70
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,839
who decided not to push the red button.

71
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,839
Phew, a close shave then. Well, Neil, all this doom mongering has made me want to just give it all up

72
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,920
and live on a desert island.

73
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,519
Like the dodo, ASAM.

74
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,759
So which island would that be? If you remember today's quiz question asked

75
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,959
where the dodo was from? I said the Galapagos.

76
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,359
And I'm afraid to say it was B Mauritius.

77
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:18,639
So to recap, in this program we've been discussing Doomsday, the final day of life on Earth

78
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,839
and other existential threats, dangers threatening the survival of humans on the planet.

79
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,799
We looked back throughout the historical record, all recorded human history,

80
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,960
to see examples of threats which have wiped out or killed millions of people in the past,

81
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,040
including wars and plagues, which spread epidemic diseases between populations.

82
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,319
And we've seen how modern dangers like nuclear war and climate change further reduce the

83
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:52,240
probability of human survival. But, Sam, it's not all doom and gloom.

84
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:58,000
The same scientific intelligence which split the atom could also find solutions to our human

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,879
made problems in the 21st century, don't you think?

86
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:06,959
Okay, so the end of the world might be a false alarm or unfounded warning after all.

87
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,360
Let's hope we'll all still be here next time for another edition of 6 Minute English.

88
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,519
Bye for now. Bye bye.
