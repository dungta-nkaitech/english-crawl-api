4
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,359
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,199
And I'm Georgina. Have you finished writing that report yet, Neil?

6
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,160
Er, not quite. It's almost done.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,000
Well, finish it this morning, please.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,600
Then make sure you've planned all the studio sessions for the week

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,079
and show me so I can double check. Okay?

10
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,160
Okay. Has this ever happened to you being micromanaged by someone?

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,280
That's what it's called when your boss wants to control everything

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,200
down to the smallest detail.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,880
And I noticed you've written the report in font size 11

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,439
when I told you to use size 12.

15
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,480
Oh, if this keeps up, I might go on strike.

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,760
It wouldn't be the first time someone has refused to continue working

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,520
because of an argument with their boss.

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,400
Maybe I'd better go easy on Neil.

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,000
After all, I don't want to repeat of what happened on the American

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,760
Spaceship Skylab, the subject of this program.

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,800
In 1973, three US astronauts on board the Skylab Space Station

22
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,920
had a disagreement with mission control over their workload

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,760
in an incident that has incorrectly been called the Skylab Space Strike.

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,600
But before we find out more, let me ask you my quiz question.

25
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:27,280
If that's okay, boss.

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,559
Go ahead.

27
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:32,079
Well, the Skylab astronauts felt they had been given too much work

28
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,319
to complete during the space flight.

29
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,919
But how did they protest to their bosses at ground control?

30
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:41,439
Did they, A, pretend the radio had broken?

31
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,239
B, stop shaving and grow beards?

32
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,919
Or C, fake the results of their experiments?

33
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:52,719
I guess A, pretending the radio had broken, would show them whose boss,

34
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,840
although floating in space without radio contact,

35
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,000
sounds a bit dangerous to me.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,519
Okay, Georgina, we'll find out what really happened later.

37
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:06,959
Now, Skylab was planned to be the fourth and final crewed flight to orbit the Earth.

38
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,280
For scientists, it was the last chance to test out their theories in space

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,680
and the Skylab crew were asked to study everything about space travel

40
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,159
from its effects on the human body to how spiders make webs.

41
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,840
Here's one of the Skylab astronauts Ed Gibson telling Lucy Burns,

42
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,280
presenter of BBC World Service Program Witness History,

43
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,319
how they communicated with ground control.

44
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,280
We got our instructions over a teleprinter.

45
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,439
One morning we had about 60 feet of teleprinter message

46
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,240
to cut up and divide up and understand before we even get to work.

47
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,879
All space missions run to a tight schedule,

48
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,000
all the way down to exercise times and meal breaks.

49
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,919
But the Skylab four astronauts felt their ground control team

50
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,080
was being particularly bossy.

51
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,400
And I don't know if they you've ever had that we're

52
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,759
through something under the conditions of micro-management.

53
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,439
It's bad enough for an hour, but you'll try 24 hours a day.

54
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,080
And we were just now constructed that way where I'm not getting things done

55
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,199
the way we should because we couldn't use our own judgment.

56
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,639
With so many experiments to carry out in a limited time in space,

57
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,199
the Skylab crew had a tight schedule, a small amount of time to finish a job.

58
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,199
Bosses at ground control sent radio messages every morning,

59
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,239
detailing exactly their duties for that day.

60
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,479
They sound like real micro-managers, Neil.

61
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:33,519
Absolutely. Or in other words, bossy, always telling people what to do.

62
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,639
Astronaut Ed Gibson wanted to use his professional judgment to complete the work,

63
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,719
not be bossed around by ground control 24 hours a day.

64
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,000
Expression meaning all day and night.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,919
When one of the astronauts got sick, it was decided that they would take turns

66
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,360
talking to ground control.

67
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,120
But one day, all three of them missed the daily radio meeting,

68
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,319
and some NASA bosses thought they'd gone on strike.

69
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,919
In the crisis talks that followed, both crew and ground control

70
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:04,800
agreed better ways of working and communicating,

71
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,639
and less micro-management.

72
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:09,759
But the newspapers had already got hold of the story.

73
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,959
And to this day, the incident is misremembered as the strike in space.

74
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,120
Here's Ed Gibson again, speaking to BBC World Services' witness history,

75
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,039
on what he learned from the experience.

76
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,039
We all conclude that we all learn something from him.

77
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:30,639
Micro-management does not work, except when you're in a situation that demands it,

78
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,240
like a lift off or are we entry.

79
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:37,599
And, fortunately, I think that's been passed on to the space station people,

80
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,640
and they've learned that that's the way to go.

81
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,120
In the end, NASA agreed that trusting people to do their jobs was the way to go,

82
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,760
the best method for doing a particular thing.

83
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,960
I told you, Georgina, no one likes being bossed around.

84
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,439
Including the Skylab astronauts.

85
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,120
But was my outsour correct about how they protested?

86
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,720
Ah, yes. In my quiz question, I asked how the Skylab astronauts protested to their bosses.

87
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,840
What did you say?

88
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,759
I thought the astronauts, A, pretended the radio had broken.

89
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:16,319
Ah, good guess, Georgina, but actually the answer was, B, they stopped shaving and grew bids,

90
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,560
unless that was just another experiment.

91
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,159
Let's recap the vocabulary starting with micro-manage,

92
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:25,120
control everything down to the smallest detail.

93
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,000
If you're bossy, you're always telling people what to do.

94
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,559
But be careful because your workers might go on strike, refuse to work.

95
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,839
The Skylab astronauts had a tight schedule, a small amount of time to complete their jobs.

96
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,079
They felt their bosses were watching them 24 hours a day, or all the time.

97
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,040
But in the end, trusting people is the way to go,

98
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,280
the best method of doing something.

99
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,319
