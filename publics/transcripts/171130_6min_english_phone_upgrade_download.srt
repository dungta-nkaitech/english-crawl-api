00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,919
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:16,960
I'm Cuthren.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,080
And I'm Rob.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,320
And today we'll bring you a techie topic

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,960
along with 6 up-to-date vocabulary items.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,760
That's right.

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,519
And today's techie topic is smartphones.

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,879
So Rob, can you tell me which age group

13
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,479
have been buying smartphones at the fastest rate

14
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:37,679
over the last five years here in the UK?

15
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,960
Is it A 15 to 35-year-olds?

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,280
B 35 to 55-year-olds?

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,879
Or C 55 to 75-year-olds?

18
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,879
OK. It's got to be the youngsters, hasn't it?

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,439
It's got to be the 15 to 35-year-olds.

20
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,920
Oh, well, we'll see whether you got that right or wrong

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,280
later on in the show.

22
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,039
Now, Rob, a question.

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,359
How old is your smartphone?

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,679
OK, well mine, I bought a couple of years ago.

25
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:04,879
And are you happy with it?

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,719
Yes, I am. It works just fine.

27
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,320
It does everything I need it to do.

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,040
So you're not worried about not having the latest model?

29
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:13,599
Not at all. My phone works really well.

30
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,840
It has all the functionality I need.

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,640
And I'm not convinced that the latest model offers

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,640
any more than the one I've got, to be honest.

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,640
Right. Well, functionality refers to the range of functions

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,920
a computer or other electronic device can perform.

35
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,079
So let's listen now to Andrew Olowsky

36
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,960
from the tech news website, The Register.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,879
He explains why people are holding onto their phones

38
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,280
longer instead of rushing out to buy the latest model of phone.

39
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,480
What's happened is that prices have gone up at the high end.

40
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,680
And it's a kind of a cycle where people hang on to their phones for longer.

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,240
Therefore, manufacturers charge more.

42
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,239
And then people hang on to them longer to justify that higher purchase.

43
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,640
So big brand names like iPhone and Samsung make phones

44
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,839
at the high end of the market, meaning the expensive ones.

45
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:07,119
So once people have bought a handset, they hang onto it.

46
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,280
If you hang onto something, you keep it.

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,439
I've been hanging onto my phone for a couple of years and I'm hoping I won't need to change it

48
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,039
for another year or so, at least.

49
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,599
But what happens is if people aren't replacing their phones,

50
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,719
the phone manufacturers don't make a big enough profit.

51
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,120
So they start charging more.

52
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,039
And this in turn makes people hang onto their phones even longer.

53
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,560
So that's why Andrew Olowsky calls it a cycle.

54
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,479
That's where one event leads to another and then off to repeats itself.

55
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,000
So where will the cycle end?

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,959
Good question.

57
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,840
Let's listen to Andrew again talking about where he thinks the smartphone market is heading.

58
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,719
I think it's a very mature market now and you have to compare say a £900

59
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:54,879
galaxy note or a £1000 iPhone with a spectacular TV, you can £49

60
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,039
inch TV, you can get for £450.

61
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,599
Now longer has that kind of must-have luster that it might have had four or five years ago.

62
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,719
So what does mature mean, Rob?

63
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,319
Mature means fully grown.

64
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,719
We're mature adults, for example, gathering.

65
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,919
And in a business context, a mature market is where supply is equal to demand.

66
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,240
And if something has must-have luster, what's that?

67
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,759
A must-have item is something you feel you must have.

68
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,759
And luster means shine.

69
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,879
Ooh, I love shining new things, especially when it's a nice piece of new tech.

70
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,680
But £1000 is a lot of money for a phone.

71
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,840
A spectacular £49 inch TV for only £450 sells like a bargain though.

72
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
My TV's only got a small screen.

73
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,240
Yeah, we'll stop there, Catherine.

74
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,560
It's time for the answer to today's question.

75
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:54,560
Okay, so which age group have been buying smartphones at the fastest rate over the last five years

76
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,120
here in the UK? Is it a 15 to 35-year-olds,

77
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,840
b 35 to 55-year-olds, or c 55 to 75-year-olds?

78
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,000
And I said the youngsters 15 to 35-year-olds.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,599
And you are absolutely wrong, I'm afraid, Rob.

80
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,879
The answer is 55 to 75-year-olds.

81
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:22,079
Although research also highlighted that this age group tended to use their smartphones

82
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:29,199
less than younger people, the study was based on a sample of 1163 people questioned

83
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,759
between May and June in 2017.

84
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,199
Hmm, interesting.

85
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,719
Okay, well I think it's time we looked back at the words we learned today.

86
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:41,519
Our first word is functionality, which refers to the range of functions a computer

87
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,000
or other electronic device can perform.

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,120
These two computers are similar in terms of both their price and functionality.

89
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,399
Good example, Catherine.

90
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,599
Number two, if you hang on to something, you keep it.

91
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:57,039
For example, you should hang on to your old TV, Catherine.

92
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:59,359
There's nothing wrong with a 30-inch screen.

93
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:01,199
Thanks for the advice, Rob.

94
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,599
And our next word is cycle.

95
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:07,680
That's where one event leads to another and then often repeats itself.

96
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:14,000
For example, I'm in a bad cycle of going to bed late and then over sleeping in the morning.

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,680
You need to sort yourself out, Catherine.

98
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,439
You're spending too much time on social media and all that blue screen time makes it very hard

99
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,720
to fall asleep. The last thing you need is a bigger TV.

100
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,319
You're probably right.

101
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,319
Okay, so the adjective mature means fully grown or fully developed.

102
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,240
And here's an example of the verb form.

103
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,960
My investments have matured and they're worth a lot of money now.

104
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,639
Right, moving on.

105
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,160
A must-have item is something you feel you must have.

106
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,800
For example, check out the latest must-have tech bargains on our website.

107
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,079
Like a huge TV.

108
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,040
Yes.

109
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,480
And finally, luster, which means shine.

110
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:00,079
For example, I polished my brass door knob until it's shone with a pleasing luster.

111
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,600
Okay, so before Rob heads off to polish his door knob,

112
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,560
and I nip out to buy a big new television,

113
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,240
please remember to check out our Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages.

114
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,439
Bye-bye.

115
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:11,840
Bye.
