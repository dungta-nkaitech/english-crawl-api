From BBC Learning English

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,599
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,879
And hello, I'm Rob.

7
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:21,199
Today's topic is about our health and in particular our hearts.

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,559
How's your heart, Rob?

9
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,039
Uh, fine, I hope, as far as I know.

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,320
Do you take care of it?

11
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,320
Well, not my heart specifically, but my health in general, yes.

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,240
I like to exercise regularly and I try to eat healthy foods.

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,799
So that cheeseburger I saw you eating just now was a healthy cheeseburger?

14
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:41,039
Fake news, you're making that up, Neil.

15
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,320
Don't believe him, listeners.

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,519
It would break my heart if people thought I ate junk food.

17
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:47,920
Now that's an interesting expression.

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,519
It would break my heart.

19
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:52,719
We say that when we talk about things that upset us,

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,159
of course we don't really mean that our heart is actually breaking.

21
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,719
However, you do sometimes hear stories about people

22
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,959
who they say died from a broken heart.

23
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:03,279
That is today's topic.

24
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:05,679
Can you die from a broken heart?

25
00:01:05,679 --> 00:01:07,280
First though, the quiz question.

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,239
The first human-to-human heart transplant took place in 1967.

27
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,319
But what country was it in?

28
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:19,280
Was it A, South Africa, B, USA, or C, China?

29
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,159
What do you think, Rob?

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,439
Well, I think it is definitely A, South Africa.

31
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,359
Okay, we'll give you the answer.

32
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:26,480
At the end of the program.

33
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,280
Now back to the subject of broken hearts.

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,000
And if you can die from one, Dr. Nikki Stamp is an Australian heart surgeon.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,039
She's written a book,

36
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:38,079
helpfully called, Can You Die from a Broken Heart?

37
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,519
She was a guest on the BBC Radio 4 program, Woman's Hour,

38
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,760
and was asked that very question.

39
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,599
Does she think it's possible?

40
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,799
Yes, short answer is yes.

41
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:49,599
It's a little bit more nuanced than that.

42
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,359
For most of us, when we have a broken heart,

43
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,799
whether it's bereavement or a relationship coming to an end,

44
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,759
we will be fine.

45
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,359
We'll muddle our way through it.

46
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,359
We'll take not so good care of ourselves, but we'll get there.

47
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,439
However, the physical effects still happen.

48
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,159
And it is a big stress on your emotions, obviously,

49
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,599
but also on your body.

50
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,439
So she says, yes, it is possible to die from a broken heart.

51
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,639
But, Rob, is it as clear and simple as that?

52
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:15,519
Well, no.

53
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:17,680
She said it was a bit more nuanced.

54
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,639
This means it's not a simple relationship.

55
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:22,960
A situation that is nuanced has small,

56
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,200
but possibly important differences.

57
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,520
She mentioned a couple of situations where we say

58
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,000
that people could have a broken heart, didn't she?

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,400
Yes, she talked about times of great unhappiness and emotional stress.

60
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,280
One of the ones she mentioned was bereavement.

61
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,480
Bereavement is the intense feeling of sadness we get

62
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,480
when someone close to us dies.

63
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,840
The other situation where we say people are broken hearted is,

64
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,840
as Dr. Stamps said, when a relationship comes to an end.

65
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,800
So if your boyfriend, girlfriend, husband, wife,

66
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,680
or lover decides they no longer want to be with you.

67
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,520
So these are times when we use the expression to be broken hearted.

68
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,560
But thankfully, they don't usually lead to death.

69
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,439
She said that usually we muddle through.

70
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,480
This expression means that we get through our sadness.

71
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,199
Maybe slowly and maybe we don't think clearly

72
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,800
and don't make the right decisions.

73
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,759
But in the end, we mend our broken hearts.

74
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:17,920
For some people, a few people, though,

75
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,039
the emotional stress does have an effect on the body.

76
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,039
It does lead to physical symptoms and sometimes sadly death.

77
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,199
Here's Dr. Stamps again.

78
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,879
Which expression does she use instead of the word died?

79
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,119
And then for some people, you will die of a broken heart.

80
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:38,079
And we do tend to see that in elderly people

81
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:41,279
who, you know, like a few weeks after,

82
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:44,319
grandma passed away, granddad passed away a long after.

83
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,599
She says that dying of a broken heart

84
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,719
can happen with older people and she used the expression

85
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:53,759
passed away rather than the word died.

86
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,639
Dying from a broken heart may be quite rare,

87
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,359
but heart problems still exist for many,

88
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:02,159
particularly those who are very overweight.

89
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,479
This is a problem in many parts of the world.

90
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,359
But why is that?

91
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,840
Dr. Stamps says that we are increasingly time poor.

92
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,759
We have less and less free time,

93
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,840
as we're spending more time working.

94
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,439
This leads to our not doing as much exercise

95
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,040
and eating more convenience food rather than making our own food

96
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,639
from healthy ingredients.

97
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,560
The doctor says that we are not prioritising our health as we should be.

98
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,719
Prioritising means deciding how important different things are.

99
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:34,719
So we're not thinking of our health as being as important as we should.

100
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:37,120
Right, well, we're quite time poor in this programme,

101
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,159
so it's time for the answer to our quiz.

102
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:44,159
In which country was the first human-to-human heart transplant

103
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,439
the choices were South Africa, USA or China.

104
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,560
What did you say, Rob?

105
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,280
Yeah, I was sure it was South Africa.

106
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,040
Well, you were right to be sure because the answer is South Africa.

107
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,360
Congratulations if you got that right.

108
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,080
Now just time to recap today's vocabulary.

109
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,240
Yes, we started off with nuanced.

110
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,040
This adjective means something is not as simple as it might seem.

111
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,720
There may be small but important things that need to be considered.

112
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,360
Then there was bereavement, the sadness we feel when someone close to us has passed away.

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,320
Passed away was one of our other words,

114
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,120
and it's a more gentle way of saying, died.

115
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,080
We also had the phrasal verb, model through.

116
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,480
This expression means to get to the end of a difficult situation somehow,

117
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,960
not always by making the right decisions,

118
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,800
but in the end getting there.

119
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,200
Being time poor was the expression for not having enough free time.

120
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,319
And finally prioritizing was the noun for deciding how important different things are.

121
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,439
Well, that's all from six minute English today.

122
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,719
Don't break our hearts.

123
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:50,000
