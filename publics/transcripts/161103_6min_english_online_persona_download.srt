00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,919
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Sophie.

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,519
And I'm Neil. Oh, hang on. I've just got a new tweet here.

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh, listen to this. Hi, Neil, about what you said the other day.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,039
I... Oh, um...

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,199
This is from a friend who doesn't realise that regular tweets are in the public domain

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,000
and that anyone in the world could read them if they wanted to.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,600
I need to give her some lessons in cool. She just doesn't get it.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,599
Well, Mr. Cool, I don't get Twitter either, which means I don't understand why people like it.

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,079
Why do you want to put tweets out there for everyone to read?

14
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,320
You'd love it if you tried it, Sophie.

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,840
I'm not so sure, Neil. Anyway, the subject of today's show is online identity.

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,120
There are lots of social media platforms out there,

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,920
Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, and they're all different.

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,840
And the question is, do we use different identities when we are using different digital spaces?

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,240
And what's all this tweeting, posting and hashtagging doing to our language and our psyche?

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,280
And psyche means mind. Well, it's messed with my mind. I'm a total addict.

21
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,159
I check my accounts as soon as I get up in the morning.

22
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,640
And sometimes in the night, if I wake up, I couldn't get through the day without it.

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,719
Well, I'm the opposite. I'm totally unaddicted.

24
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,120
And therefore, don't need to worry about my psyche.

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,479
Now, before we explore this further, let's have today's quiz question.

26
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,319
Okay, here's one for you, Sophie. Can you tell me how many social media accounts the average person has?

27
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,400
Is it A, 3, B, 5 or C, 8?

28
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,200
I'll say 3. That sounds like 3 too many to me.

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,400
Okay, well, we'll find out if you've got the answer right later on in the show.

30
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,600
I've got 3, 5. No, hang on, hang on. I've got 6.

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,640
While you add up all your accounts, Neil, let's listen to Dr Alex Kutowski,

32
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,680
broadcaster, journalist, and social psychologist.

33
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,680
She's talking about the language we use to present ourselves online.

34
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,879
Online, we have this extraordinary opportunity to explore different aspects of ourselves

35
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:29,200
through primarily text-based communication by manipulating language and becoming wordsmests ourselves.

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:37,040
So, for example, your Twitter handle will have a U that is probably different from a U that you share,

37
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,319
if, say, for example, you have a Facebook account, or is different from a U that you would share

38
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,799
if you're on a particular forum of something that you like, some music that you like, or food

39
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:51,359
that you like, or whatever it is. So, we are wordsmests with handles.

40
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,479
What does that mean? A wordsmith is someone who is skilled at using words,

41
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,240
and a handle means a name. What's your Twitter handle then?

42
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,680
Well, you'll need to get a Twitter account to find out, but I have other handles for other social media.

43
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,560
So, there are lots of U's out there, Neil?

44
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,159
Yes, for example, I think I'm cooler on Twitter than on Facebook. I talk more, you know,

45
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,920
street. Check out my new crepes. They're banging.

46
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,920
Yo, they're well-sick. Streets, by the way, refers to the language that goes with street,

47
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,640
or urban culture, where things like skateboarding and hip-hop are popular.

48
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,240
And I think crepes are trainers. Am I right, bruv?

49
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,759
Yes, Sophie. I didn't know you could talk street.

50
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,479
I have identities that you know nothing about, Neil.

51
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,879
But getting back to Twitter and how big an audience there is,

52
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,639
doesn't that huge audience worry you, Neil? Aren't you scared of making a huge blooper online

53
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:53,120
and becoming a laughing stock? Okay, blooper means an embarrassing mistake,

54
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,959
and being a laughing stock means looking very silly when you're trying to be serious.

55
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,280
Well, Sophie, I'm quite careful about how I manage my online identity.

56
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,280
I take time to craft my words, just like I craft them for this show.

57
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,240
Really? So no bloopers on this show, then? I seem to remember one or two.

58
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,120
Well, let's move on now and listen to Dr Alex Kutowski again,

59
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,160
talking about what motivates us to put our thoughts and ideas out there online.

60
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,600
It's allowing us a platform for a potential audience that is massive.

61
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,160
Absolutely huge. So yeah, there is a lot of look at me, look at me online.

62
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,600
But that's, I think, because we're trying to reach out to as much of the audience,

63
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,000
we're trying to get as much attention as we possibly can in order to get that tribe.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,920
And also, in order to basically reach out and tell people, hey, we're around.

65
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,080
It's like having a telephone on all the time. Hey, chat to me. I'm here.

66
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,520
Anybody want to hang out? It's a big social playground.

67
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,400
Alex Kutowski says, we're all show-offs who want attention.

68
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,800
Am I a show-off, Sophie? Yes, you are, Neil. Though Alex says it isn't just about showing off,

69
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,000
it's also about connecting with people in our tribe or social group.

70
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,120
But that tribe can be enormous because people are reading posts globally,

71
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,080
not just in your own town or even your own country.

72
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,000
Hashtag scary thought. Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question.

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,319
I asked, how many social media accounts does the average person have? Is it a,

74
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,480
3, B, 5 or C, 8? I said B, 3.

75
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,879
And that is not the right answer. So, for the average person, has five social media accounts and spends

76
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,560
around one hour and 40 minutes browsing these networks every day,

77
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,319
accounting for 28% of the total time spent on the internet.

78
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,480
Now, here are the words we heard today. Get something.

79
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,160
Psychie.

80
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,840
Wordsmith.

81
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,439
Handle.

82
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,200
Street.

83
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,640
Blooper.

84
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,480
Laughing stock.

85
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,080
Tribe.

86
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,600
And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
