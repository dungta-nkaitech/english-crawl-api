5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,720
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,519
I'm Sophie.

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,480
And I'm Neil. Sophie, did you go to the corporate away day last week?

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,960
Yes, you didn't miss anything.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,519
A team building guru lectured us on how to work more effectively with each other.

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,199
We gave some presentations, had a few drinks after.

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:31,839
Right, okay.

12
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,960
An away day is a day that employees spend together away from their usual workplace.

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,359
And a guru is an expert in something.

14
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,640
So, did this guru teach you anything new, Sophie?

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,600
No, not really.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,879
Ah, shame.

17
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,439
I was hoping for some tips on how to work more effectively with my co-presenter.

18
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,239
I think we work very effectively already, Neil.

19
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,920
Now, today's show is about team building,

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,840
or encouraging employees to work well together as a team,

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,440
by getting them to engage in different types of activities.

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,159
And apparently, some companies in the UK are offering their employees' activities,

23
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,520
such as Hunger Games style combat days,

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,439
where teams must work together to kill as many of the opposing team as possible.

25
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,599
Have you seen the Hunger Games movies, Sophie?

26
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,320
Yes.

27
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:27,039
There also zombie boot camps, where military instructors train you on how to fight zombies.

28
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:29,599
That's dead people who have come back to life.

29
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,159
For the more cerebral or brainy among us,

30
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,359
there are crime investigations modeled on popular TV dramas like Sherlock Holmes.

31
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,399
Well, I'm not sure about the zombie boot camp.

32
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:44,159
A boot camp is a short course of hard physical training.

33
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,119
But the Sherlock Holmes away day sounds like fun.

34
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,679
I definitely go for the zombie experience,

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,680
though I'm not sure how it connects with most people's working lives,

36
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,680
violence, death, the living dead.

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,720
Good point.

38
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,920
So let's move on and have today's quiz question.

39
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,960
What did Chairman Mao introduce in China in 1951 as a compulsory activity for workers

40
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,319
and was reintroduced by the government a few years ago?

41
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:18,000
Was it A, Callistthenics, B, Caligraphy, or C, English language lessons?

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,240
Callistthenics, by the way, is a type of gentle physical exercise.

43
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,120
And calligraphy, by the way, is the art of writing by hand with a special brush.

44
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,039
Well, I'm going for A, Callistthenics.

45
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,120
Not English language lessons, Sophie?

46
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,919
No.

47
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,920
I'll stick with Callistthenics, thanks.

48
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,879
Okay, well we'll find out later if you're right or not.

49
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,319
Now, whilst English lessons might sound like hard work,

50
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,120
ukulele lessons are apparently catching on.

51
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,280
A ukulele is a musical instrument.

52
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,480
Top businessmen, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett both do it,

53
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,759
and stressed out city workers are following their lead.

54
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,719
Here in the UK, a number of companies have been holding ukulele team building sessions.

55
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,240
That sounds amazing.

56
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,960
And is there anything about the ukulele in particular that leaves people feeling better

57
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,920
after they played it?

58
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,319
Let's hear more about this from Lorraine Bo, who teaches people to play the instrument,

59
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,080
but listening with attention because she spoke on the phone and the line wasn't great.

60
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,039
Well, I guess it's just the fact that people don't often sing in their everyday life,

61
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,360
and it's the fact that you can play and sing play musical instrument within an hour.

62
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,319
It's quite a full-filling thing really.

63
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,640
It's not competitive, it's quite easy to do and a bit less than intimidating than it is far.

64
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,000
Lorraine, the ukulele teacher, also says her classes aren't competitive or intimidating.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,640
Which means something that makes you feel nervous.

66
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,719
Now, before we hear the answer to today's quiz question,

67
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:51,599
let's hear about a company in Abu Dhabi where leadership is taught through horse training.

68
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:57,679
Basically, you have to go in the yard with a horse and persuade it that you're the boss

69
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:59,039
by using body language.

70
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:05,679
Here's Kelly Ead, co-founder of the company, explaining why she thinks this approach works.

71
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:11,519
The horses don't care if your hair is purple, if you're a man or a woman,

72
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,920
if you're older young, if you are what religion.

73
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,040
So it transcends all of those cultural boundaries.

74
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,879
It transcends age, gender, religion, tradition, etc.

75
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,560
So that's a perfect fit.

76
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,319
And in an organization where you really need groups of people to gel,

77
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,519
who come from backgrounds which have no common norms,

78
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,439
you can teach that most efficiently with a horse.

79
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,279
To gel with someone means to connect or get on well with someone.

80
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,439
So you try to get the horse to do what you want using body language.

81
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,120
And the horse feels instinctively whether or not you are a natural leader,

82
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,120
because it doesn't recognise cultural differences hair colour and age.

83
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,959
Probably easier said than done.

84
00:04:58,959 --> 00:04:59,839
Indeed.

85
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:05,359
Now, remember I asked, what did Chairman Mao introduce in China in 1951

86
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:10,560
as a compulsory activity for workers and was reintroduced by the government a few years ago?

87
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,879
Was it A, calisthenics, B, calligraphy or C, English language lessons?

88
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,720
I said A, calisthenics.

89
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,560
Well, you are right on the button well done there Sophie.

90
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,360
Calisthenics are used at schools as a warm-up for physical education classes

91
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,000
during sports day activities and by some companies as a way of building morale

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,439
and a sense of group unity as well as to raise energy levels and encourage good health.

93
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,719
Now, shake a leg or in other words get moving and tell us the words we learned today.

94
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:54,639
They are a wayday guru team building cerebral boot camp calisthenics

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,480
calligraphy synchronise intimidating gel shake a leg.

96
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,920
Well, that's the end of this 6 minute English. We hope you enjoyed it.

97
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,840
Don't forget to join us again soon. Goodbye.

98
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,480
Bye bye.
