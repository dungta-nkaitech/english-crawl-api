From BBC Learning English

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,160
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English,

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,080
the show that brings you an interesting topic,

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,160
authentic listening practice and six new items of vocabulary.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm Dan and I'm Neil.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,160
In this episode we'll be discussing miraculous survival.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,800
Hmm.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,359
Have you ever had a near-death experience, Neil?

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,519
A near-death experience, meaning a situation where I very nearly died.

13
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:39,600
Well, I once fell off the side of a mountain, but I was saved by a tree.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,399
That's incredible.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,159
Why do you ask?

16
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,439
Well, I recently heard a story about Alcidez Moreno.

17
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:46,159
Who's that?

18
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:47,359
He's a window cleaner.

19
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,239
He cleaned the windows on the skyscrapers in New York,

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,560
except one day he fell.

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,760
Oh my goodness.

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,399
Yes, and what's more is, he survived.

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,359
Wow.

24
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,640
How far did he fall?

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,160
Ah, well, all will be revealed after this week's question.

26
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,319
According to the BBC,

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,200
what chance of survival does a human have

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,799
when falling to the ground from around three stories?

29
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,599
Is it A, 30%, B, 50% or C, 70%.

30
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,040
And by stories, you mean the entire floor of a building,

31
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,319
including all its rooms?

32
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,719
Well, I think it's got to be B, 50%.

33
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,599
Well, we'll find out if you're right or not later.

34
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:29,199
So, do you want to hear the story?

35
00:01:29,199 --> 00:01:29,919
Of course.

36
00:01:29,919 --> 00:01:31,839
Well, on the 7th of December,

37
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:35,199
Ecuadorians, Alcidez Moreno and his brother, Edgar,

38
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:38,159
went up to the top of the solo tower in New York

39
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,719
to clean the windows like they did every day.

40
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,239
And how tall is that building?

41
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,079
It's 47 stories.

42
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,159
And how did they usually clean it?

43
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,919
Well, they used a scaffold,

44
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:51,199
which is a structure of interconnected pipes and boards

45
00:01:51,199 --> 00:01:53,039
that creates a frame or shape.

46
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:56,079
Ah, so in this case, there was a platform

47
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,120
which was attached by cables or large metal ropes

48
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,359
and hung over the edge of the building

49
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:03,759
and which the window cleaners could raise and lower.

50
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:04,959
Exactly.

51
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,679
So, as usual, they filled up their buckets

52
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:09,759
and climbed onto the scaffold.

53
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,000
And, well, unfortunately, the cables were loose

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,400
and the scaffold fell from the building.

55
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,000
Both brothers fell 47 stories.

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,199
That's terrible.

57
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,479
What happened next?

58
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,680
I'll let Joe Fidgin,

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,919
presenter of the BBC show Outlook,

60
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:26,799
explain.

61
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:28,799
When firefighters arrived on the scene,

62
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:30,639
they found a crowd of distraught onlookers

63
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,639
pointing towards an alleyway.

64
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,239
Edgar had landed on a fence and couldn't be helped.

65
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,079
But our cedars was found crouching

66
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,239
in a pile of twisted metal,

67
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,639
still clutching the controls of the scaffold.

68
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,679
He was breathing, even trying to stand up.

69
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:49,199
So, firefighters arrived to find a group of distraught,

70
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,319
which means extremely worried and upset people,

71
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,959
showing them where the two men had come down.

72
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,480
Yes, and though, unfortunately, Edgar didn't survive,

73
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,400
Alcides was found clutching

74
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
or holding extremely tightly

75
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,480
to the controls of the scaffold.

76
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,439
Did I hear correctly that he was trying to stand up?

77
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,840
Did he escape the accident unscathed?

78
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,640
Unscathed means without any injury at all.

79
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,920
And no.

80
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,840
He fell into a coma for three weeks

81
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,560
and he needed 24 pints of blood.

82
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,439
I'm speechless.

83
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:21,439
I don't understand how he lived.

84
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:22,800
You aren't the only one.

85
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,640
Listen to what Dr. Philip Barry

86
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,200
from New York Presbyterian Hospital said

87
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,960
about the whole incident.

88
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,160
I don't know what adjective you'd care to use on precedented, extraordinary.

89
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,280
If you are a believer in miracles, this would be one.

90
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,320
Wow, so he can't explain it either.

91
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,080
He said it was unprecedented,

92
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,640
which means never happened or done before.

93
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,439
Yes, and he also said that it was a miracle,

94
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,920
which is an unexplainable positive outcome

95
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,360
to a bad situation

96
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,400
that people say was the intervention of a god.

97
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,000
I guess we'll never know.

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,200
But one thing I can know is the answer to this week's question.

99
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,800
Ah, yes. I asked you,

100
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,960
what chance of survival does a human have

101
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,760
when falling to the ground from around three stories?

102
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,600
A, 30%, B, 50% or C, 70%.

103
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,840
And I said B, 50%.

104
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,080
And you were exactly right, well done.

105
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,280
Wow, it's a first.

106
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,160
Shall we take a look at the vocabulary then?

107
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,560
First, we had a near-death experience,

108
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,439
which is an experience where a person very nearly

109
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:25,439
or could easily have died.

110
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:26,959
Have you ever had one, Dan?

111
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,600
When I was 14, I fell out of a canoe into a river

112
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,759
and got stuck between the boat and a rock

113
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,280
with my head underwater.

114
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,399
I thought it was the end,

115
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,240
but some people pulled me out.

116
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,600
Then we had scaffold.

117
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,399
A scaffold is a structure of interconnected pipes

118
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,040
and boards that creates a frame or shape.

119
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,680
Name a place that you might see scaffolding near.

120
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,920
They are usually put up around houses

121
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,160
when builders are working on the roof.

122
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,520
Then we had clutching.

123
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,280
If you clutch something, it means you hold it extremely tightly.

124
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,160
There's a well-known idiom that uses this word.

125
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,200
Sam, familiar, Dan?

126
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,600
Ah, you're clutching at straws, Neil,

127
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,480
which means you're trying to find a reason or hope to succeed

128
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,480
when it's extremely unlikely.

129
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,840
What was after that?

130
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,920
After that, we had unscathed.

131
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,480
If you are unscathed, you are un-injured.

132
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,920
We often talk about escaping something unscathed.

133
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,000
Have you ever escaped an accident unscathed?

134
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,639
Well, when I was six, I fell through a hole

135
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,279
that some builders had made while doing renovation.

136
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,879
I hit the ground in the garage,

137
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:27,439
but somehow I escaped unscathed.

138
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,399
Maybe I bounced?

139
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,199
Then we heard unprecedented.

140
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,560
If something is unprecedented,

141
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,279
it has never happened all being done before.

142
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,959
Can you think of an example, Neil?

143
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,959
Well, Neil Armstrong, walking on the moon

144
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,439
was unprecedented in 1969.

145
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,600
And finally, we had miracle.

146
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,240
A miracle is an unexplainable positive outcome

147
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,800
to a bad situation that people say

148
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,400
was the intervention of a god.

149
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,800
The adjective is miraculous.

150
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,400
Do you believe in miracles, Dan?

151
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,480
Well, I've never seen or experienced one,

152
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,560
but when you hear a story like this,

153
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,759
it's difficult not to.

154
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,480
And that's the end of today's six-minute English.

Bye-bye.
