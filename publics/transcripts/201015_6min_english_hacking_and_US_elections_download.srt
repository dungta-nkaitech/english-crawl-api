00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,679
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Rob.

5
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:18,800
And I'm Sam.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,320
When it comes to US presidential elections, some are more dramatic than others.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,800
But few elections have been as controversial as this November's contest

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,280
between current president Trump and his Democratic rival Joe Biden.

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,920
In America, where many votes are cast digitally,

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,960
there is a risk of cyber attacks on election day.

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,520
And with so much depending on the result, US election officials are worried.

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,240
In this programme, we'll be hearing about plans to prevent election cyber attacks,

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,040
which involve election officials working with a very unusual group of people.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,200
Volunteer hackers.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,840
Volunteers are people who work willingly without being paid.

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,560
And hackers are people who break into computer systems without permission

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,840
in order to find information or do something illegal.

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,840
But cyber attacks from hackers are not the only threat to fair and democratic elections.

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,879
In 2000, the presidential race between Al Gore and George W. Bush

20
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,159
ended in recounts and disputes over missing votes.

21
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,319
George Bush became the first modern president to win the election,

22
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,319
despite gaining fewer popular votes than his opponent.

23
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,920
But how many fewer?

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,519
That's our quiz question.

25
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:39,759
How many fewer votes did Bush win than Gore in the 2000 American presidential election?

26
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:46,319
Was it a half a million votes, b a million votes, or c two million votes?

27
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,319
I'll say b a million votes.

28
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,959
Okay, we'll find out later.

29
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,879
Now the projects Sam mentioned where official administrators team up with expert volunteers

30
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,519
to keep the election secure is called the election cyber surge.

31
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:07,439
The BBC World Service programme Digital Planet met up with project organiser Maya

32
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,079
Warman to discuss the importance of keeping the election free from interference.

33
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,199
Any attempt to manipulate or interfere with election infrastructures,

34
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:22,639
the machines, or the information sets that determine who is eligible to vote and where

35
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,919
undermines the right to vote.

36
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:29,599
And it puts burdens on voters and it impacts public confidence and high profile elections,

37
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,280
especially like the one coming up,

38
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,359
heightened the types of risks that we're talking about.

39
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:40,959
You can only vote in an election if you're eligible, qualified by having the necessary requirements,

40
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,879
for example, being a US citizen who's aged 18 or over.

41
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:51,680
It's up to each of the 8,000 local jurisdictions around the United States to keep their area free

42
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,000
from cyber attacks and misinformation.

43
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,439
Risks which have increased because the coming election is so high profile,

44
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,079
attracting a lot of attention and interest from newspapers and the public.

45
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:12,159
The cyber surge project to put expert volunteers in touch with local officials aims to prevent these risks.

46
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,560
It covers everything from making sure administrators are using the latest

47
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,479
antivirus software to more serious threats from troublemakers.

48
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,199
Now that's got me thinking, actually Rob.

49
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,599
Suppose I'm a troublemaker who wants to influence the election result.

50
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,800
So I sign up as a volunteer and gain access to all kinds of information.

51
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,479
How do we know that the volunteers who sign up are trustworthy?

52
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,599
That's a good question, Sam, and one that BBC World Service program digital planet

53
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,960
put to Maya Warman.

54
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,120
The expectation is not that the volunteer will have the keys to the castle by any means.

55
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,599
More that they will have an open dialogue with an election administrator who wants to know more

56
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,439
to explore cybersecurity enhancements in general or specifically.

57
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:05,120
Volunteers are carefully selected according to their experience and skills in cyber security.

58
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,240
Measures that help organizations and countries keep their computer information safe

59
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,920
against crimes and attacks carried out through the internet.

60
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,560
Volunteers share their expert advice by talking with election officials.

61
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,240
They won't be given access to sensitive information so they won't have the keys to the castle.

62
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,000
An idiom meaning to possess information or knowledge which gives the possessor access to power.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,160
All of which means that the 2020 election result will, hopefully, be accepted by everyone.

64
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,560
Unlike the situation 20 years ago.

65
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:45,040
Ah, you mean our quiz question roll about the 2000 US presidential election which George W. Bush

66
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,639
won despite securing fewer votes than his opponent?

67
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,040
I asked you how many fewer votes bush one than Al Gore that year.

68
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,600
And I said B, a million votes.

69
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,519
Hmm, but in fact it was even closer just a half a million votes in Florida.

70
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,560
Hmm.

71
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,319
In this program we've been looking ahead to the US presidential elections and its cyber security.

72
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,280
Measures taken to protect countries and their computer information against online crimes and attacks.

73
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,240
The cyber surge project aims to put officials in touch with volunteers,

74
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,120
people who work for free, who also happen to be expert hackers,

75
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,560
people who break into computer systems without permission.

76
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,240
But the idea isn't to commit election crime rather to prevent it by making sure

77
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,280
only those who are eligible or qualified to vote do so.

78
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,759
The project was set up because the November 2020 election has become so high profile,

79
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,160
attracting a lot of attention and interest from the public and the media.

80
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,960
And of course the volunteers themselves are carefully chosen to be in partial experts

81
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,280
who give advice without holding the keys to the castle.

82
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,280
An idiom about possessing information which gives access to power.

83
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,199
What's certain is that the world will be watching this election.

84
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,239
So if you're eligible remember to vote.

85
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:12,799
And remember to join us again soon.

86
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:13,599
Bye for now.

87
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:14,319
Bye bye.
