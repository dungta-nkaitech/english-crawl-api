From BBC Learning English

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,320
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,719
I'm Neil and joining me today is Dan,

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:19,280
who is a producer at BBC Learning English.

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,719
That is his job.

9
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:22,000
Hi everyone.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,400
Yes, that is my job, obviously.

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,359
Why are we discussing that now, Neil?

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,280
Well, you haven't always been a producer at BBC Learning English, have you?

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,439
No, I used to be a teacher.

14
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,960
And before that, you know, way back your first ever job?

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,079
Ah, I had a paper round when I was 14.

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,920
A paper round is a job.

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,439
The job of delivering newspapers to people's homes.

18
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,519
It's often done by teenagers.

19
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:49,920
14 seems very young to be at work.

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,560
And that's the topic of this 6 Minute English.

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,960
Should school children have jobs?

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,520
Seems fewer and fewer have these days.

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,799
According to the statistics,

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,280
we'll give you six words and expressions.

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,359
And of course, our quiz question.

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,159
You ready?

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,120
You bet.

28
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,519
What is the youngest age at which children are allowed to work in the UK?

29
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,159
Is it a 12, b 13 or c 14?

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,560
Well, I'm going to say 14,

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,879
just because that's how old I was.

32
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,879
And it seems such a long time ago.

33
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,640
Well, we'll find out if you're right or wrong at the end of the programme.

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,840
That let's start by hearing some British teenagers talking about their Saturday jobs.

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,760
A Saturday job is the name we give to part-time work

36
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,239
that teenagers do for extra money.

37
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:37,840
As the name suggests,

38
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,719
these jobs often take place on Saturdays, but not always.

39
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:43,599
That's right.

40
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:49,040
Saturday job is a general term we use to describe part-time work done by teenagers.

41
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,960
The work might take place on Sundays or any day of the week, in fact.

42
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,119
Let's hear from these British children about their Saturday jobs.

43
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,399
We have to face all the stuff on the shelves to make it look organised

44
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,119
and show customers where products are after the need to know.

45
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,599
On the average week I work nine hours, so two hours for two school nights,

46
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,560
and then I work four hours on a Saturday and two hours on a Sunday.

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,120
And then in their school holidays can work more,

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,159
so it's like around 16 in the school holidays.

49
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,560
The first teenager said the work involves making the shelves look organised.

50
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,280
Shop work is a very typical Saturday job.

51
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,800
Oh yes, I spent many a weekend and evenings stacking shelves.

52
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,080
The second teenager's Saturday job takes place Saturdays, Sundays and evenings.

53
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,439
As we said, a Saturday job is not just for Saturdays.

54
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,000
A Saturday job is seen almost as a right of passage in the UK.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,920
A right of passage is the name we give to events or ceremonies

56
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,120
that form an important stage in a person's life.

57
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,319
That's right, like graduating from school or having children.

58
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,959
But according to the latest statistics in the UK, that is all changing.

59
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,519
Listen to this BBC report.

60
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,799
In order to work, they need a permit from the local authority.

61
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:06,560
And our data shows the number being issued has fallen

62
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:13,840
from nearly 30,000 permits in 2012 to just 23,000 in 2016.

63
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,639
Employers frequently bimmone the lack of work experience young people have,

64
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:23,119
but teenagers are also facing pressure not to take up part-time jobs

65
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,839
and to concentrate on their studies instead.

66
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,679
So, it seems that fewer teenagers are taking Saturday jobs.

67
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,599
But there's a conflict here.

68
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,239
Yes, on the one hand, employers bimmone the lack of work experience young people have.

69
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,799
Bimmone, meaning complain about.

70
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,319
It's a rather formal word.

71
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,560
But on the other hand,

72
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,400
teenagers are facing pressure not to take part-time jobs

73
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,400
and to concentrate on their studies.

74
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:56,640
Some people think working could be detrimental to a school child's academic progress.

75
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,159
Detrimental, which means causing harm.

76
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,439
It's a tricky one, isn't it?

77
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,199
I think my Saturday spent stacking shelves and serving fish and chips

78
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:10,080
taught me valuable lessons about working with adults and also managing my money.

79
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,800
I don't think it was detrimental to my education.

80
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,439
Well, you managed to get a job at BBC Learning English.

81
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,400
That's true.

82
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,240
As for me, my paper round taught me the value of hard work.

83
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,759
It didn't hinder me.

84
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,480
Hinder means to stop someone or something from making progress.

85
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,759
Well, let's not talk too much in case we hinder our students

86
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,879
onto the answer to our quiz question.

87
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,519
I ask this.

88
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,319
What is the youngest age at which children are allowed to work in the UK?

89
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,160
Is it A 12, B 13 or C 14?

90
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,000
And I said C 14.

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And I'm afraid you are wrong.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,040
No.

93
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,160
You're allowed to work from the age of 13 in the UK.

94
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,439
Exceptions to this rule include TV, theatre and modelling.

95
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,080
Oh, well.

96
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
I guess I should have spent more time at school.

97
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,800
Shall we have a recap of the vocabulary?

98
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Did you have a paper round as a kid, Neil?

99
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,680
No, I didn't, but I did help my best friend James deliver newspapers

100
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,280
in return for a pound.

101
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,879
Big money back in the 80s.

102
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:11,760
Did you supplement your earnings with a Saturday job?

103
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,319
I did.

104
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,480
I had a Saturday job in a supermarket and also in a fishing chip shop.

105
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,399
But it wasn't always on a Saturday.

106
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:20,319
Dan, is there a wedding ring on your finger?

107
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:20,959
Yes, it is.

108
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,959
Marriage is a right of passage in many cultures.

109
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,120
It's an important stage in a person's life.

110
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,800
Talking of which, are those your kids on your screensaver?

111
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,279
Yep.

112
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,480
Having children is another example of a right of passage.

113
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,039
See how tired I look.

114
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,199
Do not bemoan your lack of sleep.

115
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,120
I'm sure they're wonderful people.

116
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,280
Bemoan is quite a formal way of saying complain about.

117
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,519
I think it's okay to bemoan a lack of sleep.

118
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,399
It can have a detrimental effect on my health.

119
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,360
Ah, detrimental, meaning harmful.

120
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,439
As long as your tiredness doesn't hinder your work on six minute English.

121
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,680
Well, I'd never let anything hinder my work on six minute English.

122
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,240
That means stop from making progress.

123
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,160
I admire your dedication.

124
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,600
Goodbye.

125
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,160
Goodbye.
