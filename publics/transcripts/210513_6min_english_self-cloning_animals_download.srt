Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Neil and I'm Rob.

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,199
Do you think there are big differences between men and women, Neil? Apart from the old

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,919
stereotypes we sometimes hear like that men can't express emotions?

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,439
I suppose biologically there are differences, Rob. I mean, men and women's bodies are different.

6
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,320
Right, and it takes both a man and a woman to make a baby.

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,519
Well, that's true in humans anyway, but in this programme we'll be hearing about creatures

8
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:47,760
in the wild where the classic boy meets girl love story doesn't apply.

9
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,119
Yes, we'll be meeting some female animals who don't need a male to make babies.

10
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,879
These creatures reproduce by pathogenesis, also called virgin birth.

11
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,719
This is the process where the female can reproduce without a mate, the term used for an animal's

12
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:11,519
sexual partner. All animal species survive by making babies, reproducing to make copies of

13
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:17,280
themselves. But amazingly, the female of some species can do it all by herself.

14
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:23,760
But before that it's time for my quiz question. In Britain's Chester Zoo in 2006,

15
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,760
Flora laid 11 eggs that developed into healthy babies.

16
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,760
Her zookeepers were mystified because Flora had only been kept with other females and had never

17
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:42,480
been near a male. But what type of animal was Flora? Was she A? A python? B? A zebra shark or C?

18
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:50,880
A Komodo dragon. Well, pythons are pretty unusual creatures, so I'll say Flora was a python.

19
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,560
Okay, Rob, we'll find out later if you're right. Actually, it's not only reptiles who behave

20
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,359
this way. The females of many animal species are able to reproduce without sex.

21
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,840
By doing this they gain several advantages. They can rapidly spread, colonise and control

22
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,000
large areas and they don't waste time and energy looking for a mate. But if a world without sex

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,240
is so much better, why bother with males at all? Ha, good question Neil. And one which BBC World

24
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:27,920
Service program Discovery asked evolutionary biologist Chris Wilson. Well, absolutely and there

25
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,480
are other advantages. I mean, if you're an all female population, you don't have to waste time

26
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,360
searching and competing for mates. There are no more sexually transmitted diseases. And so it seems

27
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:44,720
like the easiest decision and yet less than 1% of all animal species are completely celibate.

28
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,920
And that's a huge fundamental puzzle in evolutionary biology that we're still not entirely sure

29
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,640
we understand. It's called sometimes the paradox of sex. Despite the advantages of going without

30
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,720
sex, in reality fewer than 1% of all animals are celibate. Live without having sex.

31
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:10,240
This begs the question, why is sex so common when it seems so inefficient? Chris calls this

32
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:17,360
the paradox of sex. A paradox is a situation which seems contradictory because it contains two

33
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,960
opposite facts. For example, the existence of males if we can reproduce without them.

34
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,560
Has a male myself? I have to say I'm feeling a little underappreciated right now Rob.

35
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,039
Well, don't worry Neil because it turns out there might be a use for males after all.

36
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:42,560
It seems the sex paradox has been solved by one of nature's most ingenious insects, Aphids.

37
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,560
Here's ecologist Amber Wright explaining how to the BBC World Services Discovery program.

38
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,640
See if you can hear the strategy American Aphids use to reproduce.

39
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:58,639
The Aphids we have in the US, when spring comes around the eggs hatch and they'll be all female

40
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:04,000
for several generations and then at the end of the summer they will hatch out males and females

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,159
and mate and then create eggs that wait next year. I'm kind of guessing both worlds.

42
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,000
Taking the bets basically using cloning to rapidly colonize and then using sex to mix up the genes.

43
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:21,680
In the spring female Aphids lay eggs which hatch. Break open allowing the young to come out.

44
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:28,560
The young Aphids that hatch are all female. But later at the end of the summer both female and

45
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,519
male Aphids hatch out and start to reproduce by mating. So the Aphids have the best of both worlds.

46
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,519
They enjoy the advantages of very different things at the same time.

47
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:45,280
Or to put it another way the Aphids hedge their bets. They follow two courses of action instead of

48
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,199
choosing between them. By cloning themselves with virgin births and reproducing sexually,

49
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,680
Aphids maximize their chances of survival. Gardeners around the world will be upset to hear that.

50
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,000
Those young Aphids just love eating tomato plants. But on the plus side it seems being male can be

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,480
useful after all. But not if you're flora. The female you asked about in your quiz question.

52
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,879
So what type of animal was she? Right, I asked whether the virgin flora was A, a python,

53
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:23,839
B, a shark or C, a commodo dragon. I guessed a python. Well Rob, you're right that some female

54
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:30,560
pythons can reproduce by themselves and sharks too. But the correct answer is that flora was C,

55
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,040
a commodo dragon. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary starting with mate and animals sexual partner.

56
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:44,560
Something you don't have if you are celibate living without sex. Animal eggs hatch or break open to

57
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,720
let the young out. And a paradox is a situation which seems contradictory because it contains two

58
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:58,560
opposite facts. Species which reproduce pathanogenetically and sexually have the best of both worlds.

59
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,519
Enjoy the advantages of very different things at the same time. And if you hedge your bets,

60
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,399
you follow two courses of action instead of choosing between them so you don't miss out.

61
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,879
Well, that's all there's time for. Bye for now. Goodbye.

62
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,560
See you.
