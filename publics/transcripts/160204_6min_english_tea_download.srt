00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,439
Hello and welcome to 6Mute English. I'm Alice.

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:16,640
And I'm Neil.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,800
Uh, Alice, what's this?

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,359
It's a cup of tea, Neil. Would you like some?

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,559
Oh, I can't drink that.

10
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,800
You didn't let the tea brew for long enough.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,560
Oh. And you forgot to add sugar?

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,480
Well, make it yourself next time.

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,320
And when you brew a cup of tea, by the way,

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,200
you add boiling water to tea leaves or a tea bag

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,799
and allow the flavour to develop.

16
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,520
I'm sorry, Alice. I didn't mean to be rude about your tea.

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,520
But I do like it very strong and sweet.

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,240
Tea is the subject of today's show.

19
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,519
And Neil, I think you'd like the way they serve tea in India.

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,960
They drink tea, a strong black tea,

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,280
served with lots of milk, sugar and spices.

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,880
Mmm, that does sound good.

23
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,640
I quite fancy a cup of tea now.

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,280
Hmm, did you know that it was the British

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,120
who introduced tea to India?

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,240
No, I didn't, Alice.

27
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,679
This is very interesting.

28
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,239
I'm proud of our habit of having tea all the time.

29
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:08,960
And tea bags are great, marvel, that's little invention.

30
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,480
Yes, I agree.

31
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,719
Well, that's my question for you today.

32
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,680
Where was the tea bag invented?

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,760
Was it in a, China, B, the US, or C, Britain?

34
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,599
Hmm, I buy a lot of tea bags, but I don't know their history.

35
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,640
So I'm going to guess C, Britain.

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,000
Well, we'll find out if you chose the right answer later on.

37
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,280
Let's listen now to Professor Markham Ellis

38
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,839
talking about the Chinese tea plant.

39
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:40,560
He's a historian at Queen Mary University of London.

40
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:45,519
Tea is a shrub that grows naturally in the mountainous areas of China.

41
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,879
And several thousand years ago, no one knows how, exactly, I mean, there are stories,

42
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:55,039
came to be clear that if you consume the leaves of this plant,

43
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:58,239
especially the younger leaves, then it had an interesting effect on you.

44
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,280
And that effect could be thought of as medicinal,

45
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,159
or it could be thought of as just kind of sanative,

46
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,159
making you feel a bit better than you used to feel.

47
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,400
Professor Markham Ellis tells us that people in ancient China

48
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,599
consumed or ate leaves from the tea plant,

49
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,759
and it had an interesting effect on them.

50
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,120
Professor Ellis says tea has a sanative effect,

51
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,400
making you feel better.

52
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,960
So I might try munching a few leaves later on.

53
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,080
All right, then.

54
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,800
Apparently, the Chinese started drinking tea

55
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,920
because of its medicinal or healing qualities.

56
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,640
And they've been drinking tea for thousands of years.

57
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,360
Well, we British may love a good cup of tea,

58
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,480
but we haven't been brewing it for nearly so long as the Chinese.

59
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,000
But remember that tea actually grows in China, Alice.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,200
We don't grow it in Britain.

61
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,759
Good point, Neil, which brings me back to what we were talking about earlier.

62
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,280
In the 19th century, the British started to grow tea in India

63
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,679
in order to compete with Chinese tea production.

64
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,120
When tea first arrived in Britain in the 17th century,

65
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,199
it was incredibly expensive,

66
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:01,679
and only the elite could afford to drink it.

67
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:04,239
Elite means a small group of people in society

68
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,159
who have money and power.

69
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,759
Well, the opposite is true today.

70
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,879
Everyone drinks tea,

71
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,680
and cheap tea bags make really strong tea,

72
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,719
just the way I like it.

73
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,799
Oh, it's not for me.

74
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:17,439
I like tea with a delicate flavour.

75
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,199
Lapsang Sushong is my favourite with its evocative fragrance.

76
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,639
Not tea bags, then.

77
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,919
No, Neil.

78
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:26,159
Lapsang is different from other types of tea,

79
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,840
because the leaves are smoke-dried over pinewood fires,

80
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,879
giving the tea its distinctive smoky flavour.

81
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,280
Sounds like a TV advert, Alice.

82
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,240
I can just see the misty mountains and the fields of tea.

83
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,599
Can you tell us what evocative means?

84
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,039
It means making you imagine something pleasant.

85
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,199
And for some people, drinking tea is a spiritual experience.

86
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,840
Let's listen to BBC reporter Mike Williams

87
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,719
learning about the Asian custom of the tea ceremony.

88
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,959
Please enjoy, Marathon Green Tea.

89
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:01,439
Thank you.

90
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,399
That was less than a mouthful.

91
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:07,919
It's very, very small amount, isn't it?

92
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,359
It's about 20 mil.

93
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:12,159
It's a way to appreciate tea in very small quantities,

94
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,199
so you can concentrate and cultivate your mindfulness

95
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,319
in drinking the tea.

96
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,399
Mindfulness.

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,600
What do you mean by mindfulness?

98
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,959
Tea ceremony has some of its origin in Buddhism.

99
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,120
The Japanese tea ceremony, for example,

100
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,680
has a lot of Zen Buddhism influence.

101
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,399
Mindfulness is the concentration and focus on the now.

102
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,040
Forget about the past, forget about the future,

103
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,519
and enjoy this specific moment.

104
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,040
And that's what I call mindfulness.

105
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,360
So they don't use mugs in the tea ceremony.

106
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,880
It's 20 milliliters or a mouthful of green tea.

107
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,000
That's right.

108
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,880
Drinking just a mouthful or small amount

109
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,240
helps you concentrate and cultivate mindfulness.

110
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,000
As the speaker explains, mindfulness means living in the moment

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,640
and forgetting about the past and future.

112
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,120
Well, forgive me for thinking about the past

113
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,440
and how about the answer to today's quiz question.

114
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,480
Okay, then.

115
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,000
I asked where was the tea bag invented?

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,240
Was it in a China, B, the US, or C, Britain?

117
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,800
And I said C, Britain, and I must be right.

118
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,839
Well, I'm afraid you're wrong, Neil.

119
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,079
It was B, the US.

120
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,959
Tea bags first appeared commercially

121
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,600
in the first decade of the 20th century

122
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,319
and were successfully marketed by Thomas Sullivan,

123
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,160
a tea merchant from New York,

124
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,319
who shipped his tea bags around the world.

125
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,439
Really, tea bags are older than I thought.

126
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,639
Now, can you tell us the words we heard today?

127
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:56,800
They are brew, consumed, sanative, medicinal, elite,

128
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,879
evocative, mouthful, mindfulness.

129
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,959
Well, that's the end of today's six-minute English.

130
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,360
You can go and put the kettle on now for a nice brew.

131
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,719
Please join us again soon.

132
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:09,600
Good bye.

133
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,240
Bye-bye.
