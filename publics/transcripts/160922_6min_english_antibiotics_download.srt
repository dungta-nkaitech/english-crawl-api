00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,120
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,719
And I'm Neil.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,199
What have you got there, Neil?

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,519
Antibiotics. I had a blister on my big toe and it got infected.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,039
My whole toe swelled up like a balloon.

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,160
The swelling has gone down now with these little wonder drugs.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,000
Look, I'll show you.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,359
No, Neil. Please keep your socks on.

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,679
Thank you.

14
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:44,159
Now, the subject of today's show is penicillin, which was one of the first antibiotics to be discovered.

15
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:50,879
So, Neil, can you tell me how many lives penicillin has saved since its first use as a medicine

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:01:00,080
in 1942? Is it a 20 million, b 200 million, or c 200 billion?

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,680
Well, I'll say b 200 million. That sounds like a good number.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,840
Okay, well, we'll see if you're right or wrong later on in the show.

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,599
Now, penicillin is a common antibiotic or substance that kills microorganisms

20
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,040
that acts very effectively against certain bacteria.

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,960
And it was discovered in 1928 by a Scottish scientist called Alexander Fleming,

22
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,440
who noticed some mold growing on a petri dish of bacteria in his lab,

23
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,960
which had a halo or circle around it where no bacteria were growing.

24
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,200
Mold, by the way, is the soft green fuzzy stuff that grows.

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,320
For example, in the bottom of my coffee cups when I forget to wash them up, Alice.

26
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,600
We didn't need to know that, Neil.

27
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:51,759
Okay, well, moving on, it took decades before scientists learned how to successfully manufacture

28
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,280
penicillin, but they got there just in time to treat huge numbers of soldiers in World War II,

29
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,159
where so many men were dying from infected wounds.

30
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,239
Hmm, and you could have died from your infected toenail before penicillin?

31
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:10,639
That is a sobering thought, isn't it, Alice? Let's listen now to Christopher Tang, professor

32
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,759
of cellular pathology at the University of Oxford, talking about how penicillin has been a

33
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:21,199
game changer in the field of medicine. The sort of cancer chemotherapy which we currently

34
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:26,000
used to do, but which immunuspress people, we couldn't possibly consider that without use of

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,919
antibiotic. So not only was penicillin open the door for treating people with the infection,

36
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,919
it's also essentially paved the way for modern medicine, modern interventional medicine that we

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,719
benefit from now.

38
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:45,599
Chemotherapy is a chemical treatment used to kill cancer cells that also suppresses or stops

39
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,919
the body's immune system from working. The immune system is our body's defense against infection

40
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:57,519
and disease, so cancer patients have to take antibiotics to prevent infections that the body

41
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,199
can't fight off by itself. So the discovery of penicillin paved the way for chemotherapy and other

42
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:08,399
types of medical treatment. And to pave the way means to make something possible. But surely,

43
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:14,239
Alice, there are some bacteria that penicillin doesn't kill. You're right. It only works against

44
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:21,039
bacteria with proteins that are sensitive to penicillin. Other types are less sensitive and also

45
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:26,799
have systems built into the structure of the cell that sweep out harmful compounds such as penicillin.

46
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,760
And what about that super bug? What's it called? MSR?

47
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:41,360
MRSA, Neil. This bacterium was sensitive to penicillin but has developed a resistance to it

48
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,439
and to other antibiotics, meaning the drugs can't harm it anymore.

49
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,400
Are we returning to the past than Alice when people like me might die from an infected toe?

50
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Well, it's possible, Neil. But drug resistance isn't new. Here's Professor Steve Jones to tell

51
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,040
us more. Penicillin is not new. It's been around for millions, probably hundreds of millions of

52
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:10,159
years in the soil. And because they've been the moles and protect themselves with it. And in fact,

53
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:16,800
you find resistance to penicillin in the most unlikely places. You find it, for example, in corpses

54
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:23,840
from before Columbus in the new world. Professor Steve Jones, so penicillin was discovered in 1928,

55
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,359
but it's actually been around for hundreds of millions of years.

56
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:34,479
Yes, and scientists have been able to test bacteria present in very old corpses, or dead bodies,

57
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,079
discovered in the new world. That's North and South America, and found that some of it was

58
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,399
resistant to penicillin. But penicillin resistance is growing, isn't it?

59
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:49,839
Yes. These days, we overuse penicillin, both in agriculture and human medicine,

60
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:55,759
which has given bacteria the chance to adapt and fight back. So it's now up to scientists to

61
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,199
adapt penicillin to extend its lifespan and to search for new types of antibiotics.

62
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,079
But prevention is better than cure, isn't it? We should all wash our hands more. It's a fantastic

63
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:12,239
way of killing bacteria. Yes, good point, Neil. But washing your hands didn't cure your toe, did it?

64
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:19,120
Now, remember I asked you earlier, how many lives has penicillin saved since its first use as a medicine

65
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:30,720
in 1942? Was it a 20 million, b 200 million, or c 200 billion? And I said b 200 million.

66
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,680
And you were right! Penicillin became the most effective life-saving drug in the world,

67
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,480
conquering diseases such as tuberculosis, gangrene, pneumonia, diptheria, and scarlet fever,

68
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,240
and made Alexander Fleming an international hero for discovering it.

69
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,960
Now, let's hear the words we learn today. They are antibiotic,

70
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:04,079
halo, mold, chemotherapy, suppresses, immune system, pave the way, resistance, corpses.

71
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,759
Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English, and join us again soon. Goodbye!
