Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,199
And I'm Sam.

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,879
How do you relax, Sam?

6
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,400
Well, I love watching movies and I go swimming.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,560
One thing that millions of people around the world do is meditate to relax,

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,800
and that's the subject of our programme.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,079
We'll be looking at experiments by scientists in the US

10
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,320
into the Buddhist practice of meditation.

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,799
We'll find out how Tibetan monks use meditation techniques to focus better and manage their emotions.

12
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,760
But what exactly is meditation?

13
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,840
People just sitting cross-legged on the floor thinking of nothing?

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,000
Well, I think there's a bit more to it than that.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,040
After all, Buddhist meditation is an ancient practice,

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,880
even science, according to some,

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,000
Tibetan Buddhism, as embodied by the Dalai Lama,

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,359
is what many people think of when you mention meditation,

19
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,520
which brings me to my quiz question.

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,560
Which is?

21
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,159
What is the meaning of the Tibetan word for meditation?

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,359
Is it A to relax, B to feel blissful or C to become familiar?

23
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,960
I think it must be either A to relax or B to feel blissful,

24
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,000
because they sound like positive states of mind.

25
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,000
But I'm not sure about calling meditation a science, Neil.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,599
Isn't it more like a philosophy or a lifestyle?

27
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,159
Not according to Professor Richard Davidson of the Centre for Healthy Minds.

28
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,359
He spoke to Alejandra Martins of the BBC World Service programme Witness History

29
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,319
about his remarkable scientific experiment,

30
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,799
which proved for the first time that meditation can actually change the brain.

31
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,599
When I first met his holiness, the Dalai Lama,

32
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:55,039
it was 1972, he challenged me, and he said,

33
00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:01,439
I understand that you've been using tools of modern neuroscience to study anxiety and depression.

34
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,199
Why can't you use those same tools to study kindness and to study compassion?

35
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:13,439
Neuroscience is the scientific study of the workings of the human brain and nervous system.

36
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,359
Professor Davidson measured negative mental states like depression,

37
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,960
in contrast to positive attitudes such as compassion.

38
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,000
That's the wish for everyone to be free from suffering.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,320
Right. In his test, Buddhist monks sent out loving thoughts to everyone equally,

40
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,640
to friends, enemies and strangers, as well as to themselves.

41
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,720
Compassionate thoughts such as, may you be happy and peaceful.

42
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,240
May you not suffer, and the results were astonishing.

43
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,520
What did they show, Neil?

44
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,480
Very high levels of gamma oscillations.

45
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,439
Now that's brain waves showing increased connections between different parts of the brain.

46
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,280
This is what you or I might experience as a flash of insight,

47
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,239
a moment of sudden understanding and clarity.

48
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,280
For us, it might last less than a second,

49
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,599
but for these experienced Buddhist monks, the gamma waves lasted minutes.

50
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,239
Furthermore, as Richard Davidson explains,

51
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,319
brain changes as a result of meditation can be long-lasting.

52
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:19,919
There is no question at this point in time based upon the current science that has been

53
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:27,359
conducted over the last ten years that meditation can change the brain in enduring ways.

54
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:32,079
And the circuits that are involved are multiple,

55
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:37,599
but they include circuits that are important for regulating attention and regulating emotion.

56
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,199
So this was proof of neuroplasticity, our brain's ability to change in response to conscious

57
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:51,039
effort. In other words, the meditating monks were intentionally reshaping their minds.

58
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,400
And this was possible because the brain circuits,

59
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,079
different parts of the brain responsible for different functions,

60
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,599
start talking to each other in new ways that created enduring,

61
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,079
meaning long-lasting, changes.

62
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,440
The meditators gained insight into how their minds work.

63
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,760
They were more focused and emotionally balanced and less likely to get upset.

64
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,040
How cool is that?

65
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,720
Pretty cool, but these two massive monks sound like Buddhas.

66
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,319
They spend thousands of hours sitting in meditation.

67
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,720
I've got to go to work, Neil.

68
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,560
What good is meditation to me?

69
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,360
Well, Sam, in fact, the experiment showed that 30 minutes of meditation a day

70
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,080
significantly increased feelings of loving kindness in the new meditators too.

71
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,360
Okay, maybe I'll give meditation a go after all.

72
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,199
But not before I find out the answer to today's quiz, please.

73
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,639
Yes, I asked you what the Tibetan word for meditation meant.

74
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,360
And I said either A, to relax, or B, to feel blissful,

75
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,199
and I'm feeling pretty confident of getting it right this time, Neil.

76
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,639
Well, Sam, if the answer came to you in a flash of insight,

77
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,519
and I'm afraid you need more practice, because the correct answer is C,

78
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,599
to become familiar, in this case, with more positive thoughts and emotions.

79
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:11,519
Ah, you mean emotions like kindness and compassion?

80
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,000
The thought wishing everyone to be free from their problems.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,560
What other vocabulary did we learn today, Neil?

82
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,599
Well, it turns out meditation is actually a science,

83
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:26,000
neuroscience, in fact, which is the study of the human brain and nervous system.

84
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,920
Meditation experiments proved neuroplasticity, the brain's ability to restructure.

85
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,399
By generating and sending out the compassionate wish,

86
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:42,319
may all beings be happy, Buddhist meditators change their brain circuits,

87
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,519
different parts of the brain responsible for different functions.

88
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,480
And this is an enduring change, meaning it lasts and increases over a long period of time.

89
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,480
I must say, Sam, you took it pretty well when you guessed the wrong answer just then.

90
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,680
Thanks, Neil. I don't like getting upset, so I'm trying out some breathing meditation,

91
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,480
breathing in the positive, breathing out the negative.

92
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,480
Join us again soon for another interesting discussion on six-minute English from BBC Learning English.

93
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,600
Bye for now. Bye-bye.
