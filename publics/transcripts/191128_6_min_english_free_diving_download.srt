From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,120
Hello, this is 6 Minute English and I'm Neil.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,480
And I'm Georgina.

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,879
Now Georgina, what do you know about free diving?

8
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:23,839
Free diving is a sport where people dive underwater

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,039
as deep as they can without carrying air tanks.

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,760
So just by holding their breath.

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,000
That's right, we're going to find out today

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,560
about a world record free diver.

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,000
But first, a question.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,760
And this is a physics one.

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,000
On dry land, at sea level,

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,800
the pressure or weight of all the air above us

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,120
is known as an atmosphere.

18
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,680
How far underwater do you have to go

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,799
until the weight of water is equal in pressure

20
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,799
to another atmosphere?

21
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:57,040
Is it a, 1 meter, b, 10 meters, or c, 100 meters?

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,640
What do you think Georgina?

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
Hmm.

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,679
Well, water is much heavier than air,

25
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,439
but there is a lot of air above us, many kilometers.

26
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,640
So I don't think 1 meter of water is heavy enough,

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,159
same for 10 meters.

28
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,280
So I think 100 meters is the equivalent of one atmosphere.

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,120
OK, we'll find out if you are swimming comfortably

30
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,079
or completely out of your depth later.

31
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,359
Herbert Nitch holds the world record for the deepest free dive.

32
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,159
In 2012, he reached a depth of 253 meters.

33
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,640
Recently, he spoke on the BBC World Service Radio Program

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,159
Outlook about his experiences.

35
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,159
He spoke about how he trained himself

36
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:39,640
to hold his breath for a long time.

37
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,680
Lungs are the organs in the body that hold the air

38
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,920
that we breathe in.

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,799
And he says that he trains himself not by starting

40
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,680
with a big breath, but when his lungs are already empty.

41
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,039
Why is that?

42
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,000
The reason why I do it on empty lungs

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
is that the urge to breathe comes earlier,

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,400
and this is when the training starts,

45
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,719
because when you hold your breath on full lungs,

46
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,640
urge to breathe comes like a human is in.

47
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,159
But the time up to that point is not training at all.

48
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:11,680
Only the time where you have to urge your breath

49
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,879
and fight against it, that's the time you're actually training.

50
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,520
So why train with empty lungs?

51
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,759
Because you have to practice not breathing

52
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,239
when you need to breathe.

53
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,599
Can you explain further?

54
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,639
Of course.

55
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,000
Normally our breathing is automatic.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We don't have to think about it.

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,039
If you hold your breath, there is a point

58
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,439
where your body tells you that it's time to breathe.

59
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,679
And at that point, most of us will take a breath, won't we?

60
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:37,759
Exactly.

61
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,879
Our body and brain is telling us, go on, breathe, take a breath.

62
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:45,639
This strong feeling to do something is called an urge.

63
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:47,319
To hold your breath for a long time,

64
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,120
you have to ignore that urge.

65
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,039
You have to fight against it.

66
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,240
So to train to do that, it's a waste of time taking a big breath

67
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,960
because holding your breath when you don't need to breathe

68
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,400
isn't difficult.

69
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,200
You have to practice fighting against that urge to breathe.

70
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,520
Niche did a lot of free diving in lakes

71
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,560
in his home country of Austria.

72
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,240
Diving in lakes is very different from diving in the ocean.

73
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,920
Here he is describing the experience.

74
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,840
In the beginning, it's very spooky.

75
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,159
And yeah, it's not a pleasant feeling at all in the beginning.

76
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,360
It's something actually quite intimidating.

77
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,759
But after a while, you get used to it

78
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,439
and you learn to appreciate it actually,

79
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,719
that it's so quiet.

80
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,199
Quiet and you're deprived of all sensations,

81
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:39,120
except the cold, of course.

82
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,680
And so you're here at your own heartbeat

83
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,520
because there's absolutely no sound.

84
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,200
How does he describe the sensation?

85
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,719
It's very cold, dark and quiet when diving deep in lakes.

86
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,120
And at first, he says, the experience is spooky.

87
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,480
This means it's a little scary and mysterious.

88
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,920
In the same way, we might find a graveyard at night, spooky.

89
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,240
That kind of feeling.

90
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,560
And he also says it's intimidating,

91
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,560
which is a feeling of being frightened

92
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,320
by something stronger and more powerful than you are.

93
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,760
And you experience these feelings

94
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:16,879
because you are deprived of all sensations.

95
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,120
When you are deprived of something, it means you don't have it.

96
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,480
It's taken away and sensations are the way we experience the world.

97
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,240
So sound, sight and smell.

98
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,680
Diving in cold, dark, silent waters,

99
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,039
you are deprived of many of our usual sensations.

100
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,360
And that is spooky and intimidating.

101
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,039
Rather him than me, I don't think I'd like that experience at all.

102
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,199
Right, before we review our vocabulary,

103
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,839
let's have the answer to the quiz.

104
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:46,079
How far underwater do you have to go

105
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,879
until the weight of water is equal in pressure

106
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,319
to another atmosphere?

107
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,159
Georgina, what did you say?

108
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,000
I thought 100 metres.

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,839
Well, that is actually the equivalent of 10 atmospheres.

110
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,719
So the correct answer is 10 metres.

111
00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:02,240
Every 10 metres of depth in water

112
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,360
is the equivalent to the weight and pressure

113
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,879
of the air above us at sea level.

114
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:09,319
There is a difference between fresh and salt water,

115
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:12,199
but it's not so much as to make your answer correct.

116
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,879
Well done if you got that right.

117
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:16,920
Well, I was clearly out of my depth with that question.

118
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,959
And you were now vocabulary.

119
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,920
The part of our body that holds our breath is our lungs.

120
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,000
A very strong need or desire to do something like breath is an urge.

121
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,439
Something spooky is a little scary and mysterious.

122
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,439
And it can also be intimidating,

123
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:35,480
which means it's overpowering and frightening in a way

124
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,480
that makes you less confident.

125
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,720
And to be deprived of sensations

126
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,720
means to have certain feelings like touch and hearing taken away.

127
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,200
So Georgina, do you fancy free diving?

128
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,000
Well, would I like to go hundreds of metres down

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,560
in cold, dark, silent water

130
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,480
without any breathing equipment?

131
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,759
Let me think about that.

132
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,640
I've thought about it.

133
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,439
No, thank you.

134
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,680
Not my cup of tea either.

135
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,120
And speaking of tea, it's time for us to go and get a cup of.

136
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,400
That's all from us.

137
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,520
Do join us next time.

138
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,919

140
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:10,839
Goodbye for now.

141
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,039
Bye.
