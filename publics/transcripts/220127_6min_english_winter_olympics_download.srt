Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,960
I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,640
And I'm Sam.

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,320
Sam, would you describe yourself as Sporty?

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,400
Well, I do like to go running and I might watch some sport on TV.

8
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:34,280
Would you watch sports like Bandy, Skeleton, or perhaps Luj?

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,679
Ah, you're talking about quite specialised sports.

10
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:43,719
Played on ice or snow, and that's because it's almost time for the Winter Olympics.

11
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,239
Yes, you're right.

12
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,000
The 2022 Winter Olympics starts in Beijing on the 4th of February.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,280
This event will mark the return of the Olympics to Beijing for the first time in 14 years,

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,359
having previously hosted the 2008 Summer Games.

15
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,560
That means Beijing will become the first city in the world

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,079
to have hosted both the Winter and Summer Games.

17
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,480
But these latest games are not without controversy.

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,960
That's disagreement or argument about something people have strong feelings about.

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,359
More about that later, but as usual, I have a question for you, Sam.

20
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,439
The Winter Olympics have not been around as long as the Summer Olympics.

21
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,079
So, do you know when the first Winter event took place?

22
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:35,120
Was it in A, 1904, B, 1924, or C, 1934?

23
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,560
Well, as they are relatively new, I'll go for C, 1934.

24
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,560
Okay, Sam, we'll find out if that's right later in the programme.

25
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,159
Now, this latest Winter Olympics are scheduled to include a record 109 events

26
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:57,920
over 15 disciplines in seven sports, by Athlyn, Bob Sledding, Curling, Icehockey,

27
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,759
Luge, Skating and Skying.

28
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,719
A discipline in this context is a particular way of doing a sport.

29
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:09,039
The BBC's China Correspondence, Stephen MacDonald,

30
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:15,159
went to a recent test event for the Olympics and explained what the organisers are hoping for.

31
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,840
In the mountains outside Beijing, the test events are in full swing.

32
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:24,680
Games organisers will be hoping, despite the coronavirus headaches,

33
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,520
despite the alleged human rights abuses, despite the allegations from a former Chinese Olympian,

34
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,680
a tennis star at that, involving a senior government official

35
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,640
that they can still produce a memorable Winter Olympics.

36
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:45,640
So, that was Stephen MacDonald at a test event, which he described as being in full swing.

37
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,520
So, at its highest level of activity, it's busiest.

38
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,560
And he mentioned the controversy surrounding the games.

39
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,320
Yes, he mentioned the coronavirus headache, not an actual headache,

40
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,160
but something that causes a lot of problems.

41
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,800
Covid-19 certainly makes it difficult to plan a huge event like this,

42
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,920
particularly managing people who are travelling from all parts of the world.

43
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,120
On top of this, China is accused of human rights abuses against the Wiga Muslims,

44
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,840
and there is controversy around the tennis player Peng Shui.

45
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,879
But, despite the issues facing the games organisers,

46
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:26,800
they want to put on an event that is hard to forget for good reasons.

47
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,719
Stephen used the word memorable.

48
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:34,800
Well, seeing athletes hurtle down an icy track at 130 kilometres an hour

49
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,840
on what looks like a tea tray is certainly unforgettable.

50
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,039
This is what they call the skeleton.

51
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:47,640
Hmm, let's hear more about the preparations for the games from the BBC's Stephen MacDonald.

52
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:54,039
The games will be held in a freezing, mostly dry area.

53
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:57,080
A mountain of snow-making is required.

54
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,000
But this can make for quick, dynamic runs.

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,920
The athletes we spoke to said these sites will make for high quality competition.

56
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,199
For everyone here, the clock is now ticking.

57
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,039
So, despite this being a winter event held in a cold place,

58
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:17,759
enormous quantities of artificial snow have to be made.

59
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,120
Stephen MacDonald describes this as a mountain of snow,

60
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,639
not a real mountain, but a larger amount of it.

61
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,480
But some athletes say this type of snow is good for speed

62
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,719
and changing and developing or dynamic conditions.

63
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:36,480
They hope it will be a high-quality competition.

64
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,439
Let's hope so, and it's not long until it starts.

65
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:45,120
And for the athletes, the clock is ticking, meaning time is running out to prepare.

66
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,240
And our time is running out too, so Neil, what's the answer to the question you asked me?

67
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,199
Ah, yes. I asked you when the first winter Olympics took place.

68
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,120
And I said, 1934.

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,920
Which was, I'm afraid to say Sam, the wrong answer.

70
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,560
The first winter Olympic Games took place in 1924 and were held in Chamonix in the French Alps.

71
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,319
The Beijing Winter Olympics is the 24th Games,

72
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,719
and the Paralympic Games will take place a month later in the city between the 4th

73
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:19,439
and the 13th of March 2022.

74
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:23,519
Looks like I need to brush up on my winter Olympics knowledge,

75
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,519
but not before we recap some of the vocabulary we've mentioned,

76
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:34,240
starting with controversy, disagreement or argument about something people have strong feelings about.

77
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,199
We talked about something being in full swing,

78
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,360
so at its highest level of activity.

79
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,199
And a headache is metaphorically, something that causes you a lot of problems.

80
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,000
A mountain is not only a very high hill used metaphorically,

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,920
it means a large amount of something.

82
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,040
Something continually changing and developing can be described as dynamic.

83
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:04,160
And finally, the clock is ticking, means time is running out to prepare for, or complete something.

84
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,480
Well, the clock is no longer ticking for us because our six minutes are up.

85
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,080
Goodbye for now.

86
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,720
Bye-bye!
