00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,440
Hello, this is 6M8English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,719
And I'm Neil.

6
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:22,800
In this program, we're discussing something we've heard a lot about during the pandemic.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,920
Kindness.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,199
When was the last time you did something kind for someone else, Sam?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,160
I gave my mum flowers last week.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,399
Ah, that was kind. How did it feel?

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,879
It felt good knowing I'd made her happy.

12
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:39,359
Right. It's something that psychologists are starting to prove scientifically,

13
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,439
but that most of us knew all along.

14
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:46,079
We feel just as good being kind to someone else as when someone is kind to us.

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,719
It reminds me of something called a random act of kindness.

16
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,159
Have you heard of that, Neil?

17
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,280
Yes, things like helping a stranger cross the road.

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,800
Small everyday things people do to help others for no other reason than to make them happy.

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,480
Yes, and one of the main benefits of being kind is that we feel the kindness in ourselves.

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,439
It's called the gift that keeps on giving.

21
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,680
And it reminds me of my quiz question.

22
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:20,960
In 2021, a global survey conducted for the BBC's kindness test asked people to name their top five

23
00:01:21,199 --> 00:01:22,640
random acts of kindness.

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,079
So which kind act came top?

25
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,280
Was it A, giving someone a smile,

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,519
B, giving someone a hug,

27
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,119
or C, giving someone your time to just listen?

28
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:40,239
They all sound wonderful, but what I'd really like is a nice big hug.

29
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay, Neil. We'll find out later if that's the right answer.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,439
Now, that good feeling Sam got from giving her mum flowers

31
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,799
is something psychologists have become very interested in.

32
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,879
During the past decade, over a thousand academic papers were written,

33
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,799
including the term kindness.

34
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,039
The author of one such paper is Dr. Dan Campbell Mecheljohn,

35
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:04,079
senior psychologist at the University of Sussex

36
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,280
and researcher for the BBC's kindness test.

37
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,120
Here is Dr. Campbell Mecheljohn discussing his findings with BBC World Service Program Health Check.

38
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,159
What we know from the sciences and what can seem counterintuitive

39
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:21,599
because giving can cause something of ourselves,

40
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,039
is that we can experience a sense of reward when we are kind to others.

41
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,560
So like when we eat a yummy food or have a pleasant surprise,

42
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,560
the parts of our brain that help us remember these nice experiences

43
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,360
and motivated us to do them again and again,

44
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,280
they become active when we're kind and we call this feeling a warm glow.

45
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,599
Usually giving something away, money for example,

46
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,920
means we no longer possess it.

47
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,080
But kindness is different.

48
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,599
Both the giver of kindness and the receiver experience

49
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,520
with Dr. Campbell Mecheljohn calls a warm glow,

50
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,680
an inner feeling of happiness.

51
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,439
Nevertheless, for some people,

52
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,000
giving something away equals losing it.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,599
So for them, being kind seems counterintuitive,

54
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,240
opposite to the way you expect things should happen.

55
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,600
But on a chemical level, the brain doesn't agree.

56
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,120
For our brain, being kind feels as good as any other pleasurable activity.

57
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,360
For example, eating something yummy,

58
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,280
something delicious, which tastes good.

59
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,160
Okay Sam, I can see that being kind is great in my personal life,

60
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,760
but what about the ruthless world of business or politics?

61
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,000
Surely there's no place for kindness there.

62
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,320
It's true that in many countries,

63
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,359
politics involves fierce, debasing criticism of anyone who disagrees with you.

64
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:42,799
But there are those who believe it doesn't have to be like that.

65
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:45,120
Jennifer Nagel for one.

66
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,199
She's a co-director of a movement called Compassion in Politics,

67
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,199
an author of the book We, written with the actor Julian Anderson.

68
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,240
Listen as Jennifer explains her vision to BBC World Service program, Health Check.

69
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,280
Compassionate leadership leads to inclusive,

70
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,320
cooperative outcomes which lead to fairer society's lower crime rates,

71
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,719
higher levels of health and well-being.

72
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,760
And yet we have this idea that compassion somehow doesn't belong,

73
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,160
that it can be dismissed in the same way as women have been dismissed as something fluffy

74
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,280
and a nice idea, but not really practical.

75
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,639
But in fact, the science behind compassion is that it actually takes courage to act with compassion.

76
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:30,560
Jennifer wants politics to be based on compassion,

77
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,199
a strong feeling of empathy with the suffering of others and a wish to help them.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,120
She says kindness is something dismissed as fluffy, soft and woolly,

79
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,240
something not considered serious or important,

80
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,959
but in fact being compassionate is not easy and takes courage.

81
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,319
Jennifer's is a strong voice for a kinder, more compassionate society,

82
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,959
but I bet even she could use a random act of kindness now and again, maybe a hug.

83
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:04,800
Ah, that's right Neil. A hug was one of the top five random acts of kindness I asked about in my

84
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,800
quiz question, along with smiling and listening, for which came out on top.

85
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,399
I said it was B, giving someone a hug, so was I right?

86
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:17,360
Giving a hug was the wrong answer, I'm afraid.

87
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,879
The number one random act of kindness was A, giving a smile,

88
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,399
but don't worry Neil, I have a big hug waiting for you here.

89
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,560
Ah, thanks Sam, that's so kind.

90
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,680
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from this discussion about random acts of kindness.

91
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,240
Small things people do to be kind to others.

92
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,600
Something counter-intuitive doesn't happen in the way you expect it to.

93
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,560
Yummy means delicious or tasting very good.

94
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,319
A warm glow describes the pleasant inner feeling of happiness at doing something kind.

95
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,680
Compassion is a feeling of sympathy for the suffering of others and a wish to help them.

96
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,680
And finally, something fluffy is soft and woolly, not considered serious or important.

97
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,519
Our six minutes are up, but if you've enjoyed this program, why not go out and perform your own random

98
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:10,159
act of kindness? Goodbye for now. Bye.
