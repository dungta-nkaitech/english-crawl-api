00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,919
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:13,280
And I'm Beth.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,240
Neil, what type of foods do you often eat?

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,839
Well, basic things to fill me up, that sort of bread potatoes.

7
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:25,839
Well, food like this, which is regularly eaten by many people,

8
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,080
is known as a staple.

9
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:32,799
In Britain, bread is a popular staple, but for large parts of the world,

10
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,320
there's another food which is number one, rice.

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,960
That's right. Over half the world's population eats rice as the staple food,

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,119
especially in Asia. But rice is a very thirsty crop,

13
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,359
which needs lots of water to grow.

14
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,920
And this is becoming a problem because of droughts and flooding caused by climate change.

15
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,200
In this programme, we'll be hearing about a pioneering new technique,

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,280
helping farmers to grow rice in the face of a changing climate.

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,280
As usual, we'll be learning some useful new words and phrases.

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,920
And remember, you can find all the vocabulary from this programme on our website,

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,000
BBCLearningEnglish.com.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,480
But first, I have a question for you, Beth.

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,719
Just now, I mentioned that rice is a very thirsty crop.

22
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,040
So how much water is needed to grow one kilogram of rice?

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,640
Is it a thousand to three thousand litres?

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,560
B, three thousand to five thousand litres, or C, five thousand to seven thousand litres?

25
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,200
I'm going to say C, five thousand to seven thousand litres.

26
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,799
Well, we'll find out if that's right at the end of the programme.

27
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,400
Dr. Ivonne Pinto is Director General of the International Rice Research Institute,

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,760
or I-R-R-I, for short, based in the Philippines.

29
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,240
Here, she explains more about the global popularity of rice to BBC World Service programme,

30
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,839
the food chain.

31
00:01:57,839 --> 00:02:05,119
Between 50 and 56 per cent of the world's population rely on rice as the principal staple.

32
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,839
Now, that's roughly about four billion people.

33
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,319
And it is one of those commodities that is grown really extensively,

34
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,879
particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia.

35
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:21,120
But increasingly, the appetite for it is growing in continents like Africa.

36
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,120
And of course, there are also Latin American and European rice varieties

37
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,319
Rice is a commodity, a produce that can be bought and sold.

38
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,640
Like other crops, rice has varieties, different types, for example, brown rice,

39
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,719
long-grain rice or basmati.

40
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,120
Much of the research into rice today is focused on making new varieties that can adapt to

41
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,439
the changing environment and grow in conditions of either too much or too little water.

42
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:57,280
Over half the world's population eats rice and there's a growing demand in Africa and Europe too.

43
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,919
So clearly, there's an appetite, a strong desire, for rice worldwide.

44
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,479
So, is it possible to grow rice in a more eco-friendly way?

45
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,960
Jean-Philippe Labaud, director of Rice Company Tilda,

46
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:17,120
thinks the answer lies in a new growing technique called alternate wet drying,

47
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,759
or AWD for short.

48
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:25,439
To grow rice, farmers go through cycles of flooding their fields or paddies, which then dry out

49
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:32,479
and need to be flooded again. With AWD, measuring pipes are placed 15 centimetres underground

50
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,759
so that farmers can check water levels at any part of the field.

51
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,199
Normally, rice needs 25 cycles of flooding and drying out to grow.

52
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:48,000
But using AWD, this is reduced to 20 cycles, saving farmers water and reducing methane emissions.

53
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,199
His Jean-Philippe Labaud, telling Gruth Alexander, presenter of BBC World Services,

54
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,080
the Food Chain, how he began his AWD experiment with farmers in India.

55
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:07,680
We've got last year 1268 farmers on board applying this AWD technique to reduce the overall

56
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,639
methane emission.

57
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,439
And how did you persuade those farmers to give it a go?

58
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,840
That was quite challenging because obviously the main challenge is for farmers,

59
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,439
the apprehension to lose revenues. They need to see tangible results at the end of the crop,

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,160
that they are getting obviously something better.

61
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,879
Many Indian farmers got on board with Jean-Philippe's experiment.

62
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,840
If you get on board with something, you agree to a plan of action and get involved.

63
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,079
In other words, you give it a go, you try doing something to see if it works.

64
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:45,360
As it turned out, the new technique produced tangible results, results which are real and measurable.

65
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:52,560
Using AWD, the amounts of water and electricity needed to grow rice decreased.

66
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,879
Methane gas emissions reduced, and on top of that, the amount of rice yielded increased.

67
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:02,959
Right, Neil? Isn't it time you revealed the answer to your question?

68
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:09,039
I asked how many litres of water are needed to grow just one kilogram of rice.

69
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:15,599
And the answer was 3,000 to 5,000 litres, so thirsty, but not as thirsty as you thought.

70
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,039
OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme, starting with commodity,

71
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,519
a product like rice that can be bought and sold.

72
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,279
Varieties of something are different types of it.

73
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,279
If there's an appetite for something, there's a strong desire or demand for it.

74
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,079
If you get on board with an idea or a plan, you agree to do something and get involved with doing it.

75
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,719
To give it a go means to try doing something.

76
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,520
And finally, the adjective tangible means real and measurable.

77
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,480
Once again, our six minutes are up.

78
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,440
