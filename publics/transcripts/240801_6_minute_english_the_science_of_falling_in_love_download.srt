00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,359
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:19,120
Head over heels, butterflies in the tummy, the apple of my eye.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,800
In English, there are many idioms to describe what it feels like to fall in love.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,560
Ah, I didn't know you were such a romantic, Neil.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,840
But do you know what's actually happening in our brains when we fall in love?

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,039
Because I'm sorry to say this, Neil, but it's more about brain chemistry than romance.

9
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:45,439
Specifically hormones, chemical messengers which the body releases into the blood to control our

10
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,040
growth, mood, and yes, falling in love.

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,679
Thanks for ruining my romantic ideas, Beth.

12
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,840
And since my dreams are now shattered, why don't we spend the rest of this program

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,119
finding out exactly what is going on inside our bodies and brains when we fall in love?

14
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,280
And of course, learn some useful new vocabulary too.

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,560
There's no doubt that being in love has the health benefit of reducing stress,

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,680
even lengthening your life. But the hormones which the brain releases have an immediate effect as well.

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:25,280
So, chemically speaking, what happens when lovers look into each other's eyes?

18
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,800
Is it A, their body temperature increases,

19
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,080
B, their heartbeat harmonise, or C, the hairs stand up on the back of their neck?

20
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,480
Is it all three? No, okay then. I'll guess it's B, their heartbeat harmonise.

21
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,320
Okay, we'll find out if that's correct at the end of the program.

22
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,760
According to Helen E. Fisher, self-help author and anthropologist at Rutgers University,

23
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,600
there are three aspects of romantic love. Here's BBC Ideas to explain more.

24
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,640
Often loss comes first, but not always. For some people who are asexual, it may not happen at all.

25
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:14,799
But for those who do experience lust, it's driven by the hormones, estrogen and testosterone.

26
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:22,399
It may feel purely carnal, but in fact, it's about the urge to mate and pass on your DNA via offspring.

27
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:26,719
Without lust, it's fair to say our species would not survive.

28
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:34,799
Helen E. Fisher thinks the first aspect of love is purely physical, lust, the strong feeling of

29
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,760
sexual desire for someone. Lust is driven by the hormones estrogen in women and testosterone in men.

30
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,920
A few people are asexual, meaning they don't feel sexual attraction for anyone of any gender.

31
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,320
Lust is hardwired into us through our DNA and it drives us to have children.

32
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,320
Helen thinks it's fair to say that without lust, our species would not survive.

33
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:08,639
Here she uses the phrase it's fair to say to introduce an idea she believes to be true and reasonable.

34
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:17,280
Of course, love is not just physical. Here's BBC Ideas again to introduce Helen Fisher's second aspect of love attraction.

35
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:25,439
The second aspect of romantic love is attraction, influenced by a neurotransmitter called dopamine.

36
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:32,159
This is a feel good substance released in our brain that is involved in driving us towards reward.

37
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:39,359
Do something, get a dopamine hit, feel good. Eventually dopamine will push us towards

38
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:45,120
repeating that behavior. This is why intense attraction feels like an addiction to another

39
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,520
human being. Some people get stuck in that loop, always chasing the dopamine-soaked excitement of

40
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:59,360
a new relationship. This time, the hormone responsible is dopamine, a neurotransmitter that rewards

41
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,600
our attraction to someone with pleasurable feelings. That's why dopamine is called a feel good

42
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:12,719
substance. The adjective feel good can be used to describe anything causing happy and optimistic

43
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:19,680
feelings about life, things like feel good films or feel good music. Here though, there's a downside.

44
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,360
The dopamine hit of sexual attraction feels so good, we crave it more and more.

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,240
Some people are always chasing the next relationship to get a new hit of pleasure and soon become

46
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,360
stuck in a loop. An idea meaning they're unable to break the habit of repeating the same

47
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:44,800
patterns of behavior over and over again. It's fascinating to see the power which hormones have over us,

48
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,680
but if you're an old-fashioned romantic, like Neil, don't despair. And speaking as a romantic,

49
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,199
how about the answer to my question? Right, you asked me about the effect on the body when two

50
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,519
lovers look deep into each other's eyes. I guess it was that their heart beats harmonize.

51
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:09,920
Which was the correct answer. In experiments, looking into the eyes produced hormones,

52
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:16,240
causing couples hearts to beat in time. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this

53
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:22,319
programme, starting with the idiom head over heels, to be completely in love with someone.

54
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:29,200
Last is a very strong feeling of sexual desire. Someone who is asexual does not feel sexual

55
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,960
attraction towards anyone of any gender. The phrase it's fair to say is used to introduce a

56
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:41,839
statement you believe to be true and reasonable. The adjective feel good describes something which

57
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:47,919
makes people feel happy and optimistic. And finally, the idiom stuck in a loop describes

58
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:54,560
someone unable to break the habit of repeating the same negative patterns of behavior over and over

59
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,319
again. Once again, our six minutes are up, but remember to join us again next time for more
