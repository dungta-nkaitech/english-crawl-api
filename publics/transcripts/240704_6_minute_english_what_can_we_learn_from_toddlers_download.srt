2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You may have one or know someone who does and at one time you've been one yourself.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm talking about toddlers.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
A toddler is a young child usually between two and four years old who is learning to walk or toodling.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's an important stage in a child's development as they learn to move and understand the world around them.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's also known as the Terrible Toos.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
When toddlers can't do the things they want to, they experience frustration, which often leads to tantrums,

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
a sudden and noisy outburst of anger.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We've probably all seen the tears and screams when a young child can't have what they want.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yes, the famous temper tantrums.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But being a toddler is also an exciting time as a child's personality starts to develop.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So what can we adults learn from toddlers?

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's what we'll be finding out in this programme along with some useful new vocabulary.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But first, I have a question for you, Beth.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Being a toddler is certainly an important stage in a child's growth, but which of the following statements is true?

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
A, toddlers are attracted to shapes that resemble the human body.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
B, toddlers are more active than at any other time in their lives.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Or C, toddlers can grow up to 3 centimetres during sleep time.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I think toddlers can grow up to 3 centimetres while they sleep.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay, Beth, we'll find out if that's the correct answer later in the programme.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
At 2 or 3 years old, there's not much toddlers can do for themselves.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
They depend on mum or dad to feed, clothes and care for them.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So it's strange to think there's anything adults could learn.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But not according to Dr Hassan Merali, author of a new book, Sleepwell, Take Risks, Squish the Peas,

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and father to his own toddler, who spoke with BBC Radio 4 programme Woman's Hour.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
When I see the toddlers by themselves, they're doing a lot of things out loud, little Julie's putting on her mitts and saying, Julie can do it.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And Colton's over on the side and he's looking down at his boots and they're on the wrong way.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
And so he says, oh, Colton did this wrong.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And this idea of cell talk is really a way to decrease stress in anxiety-provoking situations.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Dr Merali observed toddlers talking to themselves out loud.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
When you talk out loud, you speak so that other people can hear you.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But it's what the toddlers were saying that's really interesting.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
When a little girl called Julie learned how to put on her gloves, she told herself, Julie can do it.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This is a special kind of talking out loud known as self talk.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Self talk means the messages that you tell yourself and the way in which you tell them.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's your inner voice and in toddlers it's usually positive and encouraging.

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Unfortunately, as we grow up, our self talk often becomes less encouraging and more critical.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Instead of a positive loving inner voice, as adults, we tend to tell ourselves, you can't do it.

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Or you're no good.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Here's Dr Merali again explaining more to BBC Radio 4 program, Woman's Hour.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We often get into the cycle of negative self talk.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And I think one of the best strategies that we can do is give ourselves more positive self talk.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So an easy way to do it is when you're down on yourself and angry with yourself.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Think about talking to yourself as a good friend instead of actually you.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And you'll notice that difference in how you talk to yourself.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
As an adult, you might be down on yourself.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If you're down on yourself, you feel disappointed and self critical about yourself.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
When this happens, your self talk gets very negative.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
For example, telling yourself you're no good and this can lead to a negative cycle.

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
A pattern of repeating the same negative thoughts over and over again.

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
This can be a problem but not for toddlers who are naturally good at talking kindly to themselves

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
and celebrating the little things, like learning to get dressed.

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The solution for over critical grown-ups, according to Dr Merali,

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
pretend you're talking to a good friend instead of to yourself, just like toddlers do.

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It seems us adults can learn something from young children after all, being kind to ourselves.

58
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
When they're not having tantrums, toddlers really are wonderful little creatures,

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
which reminds me of your question, Neil.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Right, I asked you which statement about toddlers was true.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And I said it was that toddlers can grow up to three centimeters while they sleep.

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Was I right?

63
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I think you know that you're not right, that was the wrong answer.

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's true that toddlers do grow when sleeping but not as much as three centimeters.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
In fact, the correct answer was that being a toddler is the most active period of your whole life,

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
which isn't hard to believe if you live with one.

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme about toddlers,

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
young children who are toddling or learning to walk.

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
A tantrum is a noisy uncontrolled outburst of anger, usually from a young child.

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If you say something out loud, you say it in a way that other people can hear.

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Self-talk refers to the messages that you tell yourself and the way in which you tell them.

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's your inner voice.

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The phrase to be down on yourself means to feel disappointed and self-critical about yourself.

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And finally, a negative cycle is a pattern of repeating the same negative thoughts over and over again.

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Something a toddler would never do.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Once again, our six minutes are up.
