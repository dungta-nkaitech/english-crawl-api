00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,199
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil, joining me for this is Dan.

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,160
Hello.

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,800
And can I say, Dan, you're looking very slim.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,800
It looks like your diet is working.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,240
This is my normal figure, and I have not been on a diet.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,960
But it looks like you've actually put on a bit of weight.

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,000
Well, I may have a little punch or a fat stomach,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,799
but didn't you know that it's out of my control?

12
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,480
Some of this has to do with my jeans, not the ones I wear,

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,920
but the cells in my body that control my development.

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,240
That's what we'll be discussing in this programme.

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,200
However, our audience might describe themselves,

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,280
tubby and overweight, or thin and skinny, which means very thin.

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,560
They're more than welcome to join us on this voyage of discovery.

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,960
So let's start with answering a question, huh?

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,000
What's the name of the popular diet that involves avoiding eating carbohydrates,

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,280
and in which you can eat as much fat protein as you'd like?

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,040
Is it A, the Mediterranean diet, B, the Atkins diet, or C, the Graham diet?

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,640
I've heard of the Atkins diet, so I'll say B.

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,200
Well, you'll have to wait a bit to find out.

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,640
But, Dan, you may have also heard of a crashed diet.

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,960
That's where someone makes a rapid change to the types of food they eat,

26
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,359
with the aim of losing weight quickly.

27
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:30,319
Yes, I know that eating this way can be risky for your health,

28
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:32,159
and they don't always work.

29
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,599
That's true, and now scientists have some evidence that shows that our weight

30
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,839
is not just controlled by what we eat,

31
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:41,519
so it might be quite natural for someone to be thin or fat.

32
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,039
It's all to do with their jeans.

33
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:46,799
Research published in the journal PLOS Genetics

34
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,799
explains how twin studies have shown that about 40% of the variation in a person's weight

35
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,479
is affected by their jeans.

36
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,400
And also why thin but healthy people have genetic advantages

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,719
in terms of maintaining a healthy weight.

38
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,439
So, that means that losing weight isn't just about having willpower.

39
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,560
That's controlling your own behaviour to achieve something.

40
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,759
It's actually about something that's out of our control.

41
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,039
Yes, possibly.

42
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's hear from the studies author, Sadar Farouki,

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,840
who is professor of metabolism and medicine at the University of Cambridge,

44
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,319
and has been a pioneer in the genetics of obesity for more than 20 years.

45
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,439
Obesity, of course, is where someone is very overweight

46
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,359
in a way that's dangerous for their health.

47
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,159
Here she is speaking on the BBC World Service Programme Health Check.

48
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,280
What does she say might be one of the benefits of this research

49
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,959
for people who are overweight?

50
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:43,120
It actually can be very helpful in trying to get them to come to terms

51
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,039
with some of the difficulties they may be having,

52
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,079
but also help them to engage with help and support

53
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,759
to try and encourage weight loss.

54
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,879
I hope one of the main outcomes of this work might be to a little bit

55
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,120
start to get people thinking about that,

56
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
because people are very judgment and tend to think,

57
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,479
look, if I can stay thin and control my weight, why can't you?

58
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,000
And what I would say to that is, well, the data there shows that you're probably quite lucky

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,840
in terms of the genes that you have,

60
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,120
rather than just being either morally superior or having better willpower.

61
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,240
Some interesting thoughts there.

62
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,039
For people who are overweight, this research can help them come to terms with the struggle

63
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,280
they may be having to lose weight.

64
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,879
When you come to terms with something,

65
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,560
you start to accept the difficult or unpleasant situation you are in.

66
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,960
So I suppose she means accepting that if you're trying to share a few pounds,

67
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,159
unsuccessfully, it's not all your fault.

68
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,519
And it may stop people being so judgmental that's so quick to criticize people

69
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,120
based on their own beliefs.

70
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,000
A slim person might say, well, I at less and lost weight, so why can't you?

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,719
And now we know things aren't quite that simple.

72
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,120
You're just lucky to have the right genes,

73
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,439
but it doesn't make you morally superior.

74
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,319
So it's not just about having willpower.

75
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,719
This research is much more detailed, of course, than we've had time to explain here,

76
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,680
but for someone who is overweight, will they feel defeated?

77
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,560
Absolutely not, according to Professor Faroukhi.

78
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,680
For people who are obese, this research is helpful.

79
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,520
Not only should it give them hope,

80
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,040
it could lead to the development of medicines to help them.

81
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,639
But as genes only play a part in our size and weight,

82
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,959
we should all eat a healthy diet and do some exercise,

83
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,839
and there is always new research about the best things to do and the right things to eat.

84
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:27,279
Recently, research published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine

85
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,120
said that bursts of high-intensity interval training

86
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,519
may be more effective for weight loss than longer, less intense workouts.

87
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,719
A burst is a sudden and short increase in something.

88
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:44,000
Even if diets don't help you lose weight, eating a balanced diet can certainly keep you healthy

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,279
and make you feel good.

90
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:49,919
And as I'm talking about diets, why don't I answer the question I asked you earlier?

91
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,199
What's the name of the popular diet in which you should avoid eating carbohydrates,

92
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,479
but you can have as much fat and protein as you want?

93
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,679
Is it A, the Mediterranean diet, B, the Atkins diet, or C, the Graham diet?

94
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,719
I said the Atkins diet, and that is correct.

95
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:07,679
Woo-hoo, well done.

96
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:13,439
This well-known low-carb diet was developed by the American physician and cardiologist

97
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,480
Robert Atkins in the 1960s. Other low-carb diets are available.

98
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,120
Neil, I think it's time we've reminded ourselves of some of the vocabulary we've discussed today.

99
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,519
Good idea. Let's talk about Pornch, another name for a fat stomach that men like me and you have.

100
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:35,120
Ha, speak for yourself. I'm closer to skinny. A word to describe someone looking very thin

101
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,199
and sometimes ill. Our next word was willpower. If you have willpower, you can control your own

102
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,199
behaviour to achieve something. The next phrase comes to terms with something,

103
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,279
means you start to accept the difficult or unpleasant situation you are in.

104
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,599
If you're judgemental, you're quick to criticize people based on your own beliefs.

105
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:57,919
And finally we mentioned a burst of high intensity interval training.

106
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,800
A burst is a sudden and short increase in something.

107
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,639
Well, we've had a burst of vocabulary there and it's time to say goodbye.

108
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,919
Please join us next time.

109
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,079
And of course don't forget our website bbclearningenglish.com. Goodbye.

110
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,560
Bye.
