00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,280
And I'm Sam.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,879
Sam, have you considered the future of food much?

8
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,800
Well, I think in the future I might have a sandwich

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,120
in about 30 minutes in the future.

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,960
Not quite what I meant.

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,440
With the population of the world increasing,

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,679
along with the negative effects of climate change and other global issues,

13
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:39,600
we might have to radically change our diets in the future.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,480
Ah, yes, I have heard about this.

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,400
There are all sorts of developments from growing artificial meat

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,040
to developing insect-based foods.

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,240
Hmm, tasty.

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,960
Well, we'll look a little more at this topic shortly,

19
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,280
but we start as ever with a question.

20
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,200
And it's a food-based question.

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,480
In which consonant did tomatoes originate?

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,879
Is it A, South America, B, Africa or C, Asia?

23
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:05,920
What do you think, Sam?

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,680
Er, no idea.

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,480
I'm going to say Africa, but that's just a guess.

26
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,480
OK, well, I will reveal the answer later in the programme.

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,920
On a recent edition of BBC Radio 4's The Food programme,

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,879
there was an interview with Dr. Morgane Gay.

29
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,560
She is a futurologist.

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,159
A futurologist is someone who studies and predicts the way we will be living in the future.

31
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,000
Her particular area of expertise is the subject of food.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,799
What two things does she say she thinks about?

33
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,280
As a food-futrologist, I think about not just what we're going to be eating in the future,

34
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,719
but why? Why that thing? Why that trend?

35
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,079
Why will people suddenly latch onto that food,

36
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,280
that way of eating that food at that particular time?

37
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,799
And when I work for large companies, that's what they want to know.

38
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,280
There is an element of a hunch, and then proving or disproving that hunch.

39
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,400
So, what two things does she think about?

40
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,680
She says that as a food-futurologist, she thinks about what we will be eating in the future,

41
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,639
and also why we will be eating that food.

42
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,080
Yes, in particular, she looks at why there are particular trends.

43
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,719
A trend is what is popular now or what is becoming popular.

44
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,639
For example, at the moment there is a trend for eating less red meat.

45
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,039
She also looks at why people latch onto particular trends.

46
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,439
To latch onto here means to be very interested in something.

47
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:38,639
So if you latch onto a particular food trend, you start to follow that trend.

48
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,360
You might start eating that particular diet.

49
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,079
Information about future trends is very important for companies in the food business.

50
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,439
How does she actually predict these trends?

51
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,599
She says she starts with a hunch.

52
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,199
A hunch is a feeling you get that something is true.

53
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:02,479
You don't have any real evidence, but your experience and knowledge makes you think you might be right.

54
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,000
Let's listen again.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,759
As a food-futurologist, I think about not just what we're going to be eating in the future,

56
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,199
but why? Why that thing? Why that trend?

57
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,560
Why will people suddenly latch onto that food,

58
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,759
that way of eating that food at that particular time?

59
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,280
And when I work for large companies, that's what they want to know.

60
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,920
There is an element of a hunch and then proving or disproving that hunch.

61
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,879
Dr Gay goes on to talk about how on the subject of food there are restrictions.

62
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,840
Why is that?

63
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,759
Food business, of course, has different restrictions around it because it's about safety.

64
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,400
We're ingesting that, the supply chain and the labeling laws are very

65
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,480
stringent, especially in this country.

66
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,240
So it takes a lot longer to get an idea from just a concept that's discussed around a table

67
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:56,000
to an actual production facility labeled, branded, tested, marketed and put on the shelves.

68
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,319
So why restrictions?

69
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,080
Well, it's about safety.

70
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,000
Because we are ingesting food, which is a way of saying we are putting it into our bodies,

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,599
it has to be safe.

72
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,759
It can be a long process of developing a new food and getting it into the shops,

73
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,359
because of the need to be safe and meet the laws of different countries.

74
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:20,399
In the UK, she mentions that the food safety laws are very stringent.

75
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,279
This means that the laws are very tough, very strict.

76
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,879
Let's hear Dr Gay again.

77
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,360
Food business, of course, has different restrictions around it because it's about safety.

78
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,639
We're ingesting that, the supply chain and the labeling laws are very stringent,

79
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,159
especially in this country.

80
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:41,599
So it takes a lot longer to get an idea from just a concept that's discussed around a table,

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,080
to an actual production facility labeled, branded, tested, marketed and put on the shelves.

82
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,400
Right.

83
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,720
Well, before we review our vocabulary, let's get the answer to the question,

84
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,600
in which continent did tomatoes originate?

85
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,879
Is it A, South America, B, Africa, C, Asia, Sam?

86
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,920
What did you say?

87
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,840
I made a guess at Africa.

88
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,640
Well, I'm afraid that's not right.

89
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,600
Congratulations, though, to everyone who said South America.

90
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,720
Right, let's recap our words and expressions.

91
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,840
Okay, well, we started with the word futureologist.

92
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,879
This is a noun to describe someone who studies and predicts the way we will be living in the future.

93
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,640
Then we had trend.

94
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,000
This word can describe what is popular now and the way in which what is popular is changing.

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,600
For example, now we are seeing a trend for eating less red meat in some parts of the world.

96
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,560
If you latch onto something, you become interested in it and associate yourself with it.

97
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,960
We heard that people very quickly latch onto food trends.

98
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,480
Then there was hunch.

99
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,680
A hunch is a feeling about something you think might be true,

100
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,879
even though you don't have real evidence for it.

101
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,600
ingesting something means taking it into your body, so eating or drinking it.

102
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,520
And finally, a stringent rule is a very strict rule.

103
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,799
A tough rule or law, which in connection to food,

104
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:08,560
is designed to make sure it is safe and of a suitable quality.

105
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,759
Okay, thank you, Sam.

106
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,599
That's all from six minute English.

107
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:12,399
Goodbye.

108
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,199
Bye-bye.
