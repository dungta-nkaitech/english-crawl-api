5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,280
Hello, welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,480
And hello, I'm Rob.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,800
Now Rob, how creative are you?

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,640
Very creative, I think.

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,719
Creativity is in my bones.

10
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:24,640
Look at this wonderful script that I wrote,

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,080
and we're presenting right now.

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,039
You are what we could call a creative.

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,359
And now, which means someone with a lot of imagination and ideas.

14
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,640
In our job, we have to create or make content

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,479
that teaches English creatively.

16
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:41,519
Creativity is becoming more important for everyone.

17
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:44,879
The World Economic Forum forecasts that by 2020,

18
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,840
creativity will be in the top three most important skills for future jobs.

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,320
This is particularly relevant for younger people

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,480
who will be entering the world of work soon.

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,640
And that's what we'll be discussing today.

22
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,560
But before we do, Neil, have you created a question for us to answer?

23
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,159
Yes, and it's about the very creative artist, Banksy.

24
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,159
He created a well-known piece of artwork

25
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,000
that has been in the news recently.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,840
But do you know what it's called?

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,319
Is it a girl with balloon,

28
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,760
b girl with red balloon or c balloon girl?

29
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,519
I can see the picture in my head,

30
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,480
so I think it's c balloon girl.

31
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,879
OK, we'll find out the answer later.

32
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,079
But now back to our discussion about creativity.

33
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,599
Experts say that students need to focus more on creativity

34
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:31,280
to help them get a job.

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,280
That's perhaps surprising in the UK,

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,439
when some of our creative industries,

37
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,280
that's businesses that make music, art and TV, for example,

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,480
are world famous.

39
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,319
We're creative people, Rob.

40
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:47,359
Of course, but there's not such a focus on being creative in education now,

41
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,079
and that might have an effect in the future.

42
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,840
It's something Bernadette Duffy,

43
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,400
an early years consultant, has been discussing

44
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,359
on BBC Radio 4's Bringing Up Britain program.

45
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,560
What does she say we have been focusing too much on in schools?

46
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,640
We focus on the things that are legitimately important,

47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,880
but we teach them in a way that makes them easy to measure.

48
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,480
I think we need to redress the balance that puts the focus purely on

49
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,560
gaining the skills and far, far more on actually using them in a creative way,

50
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,200
because that's what's going to make a difference for the future.

51
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,400
So Bernadette feels we teach skills in a way that can be easily measured and tested.

52
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,120
She says we teach these skills legitimately,

53
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,280
which here means fairly and reasonably,

54
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,599
but she feels we don't teach a creative approach to learning skills.

55
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,920
So we mean things like problem solving.

56
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,240
I guess even tasks like data inputting and preparing spreadsheets

57
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,400
can be approached creatively.

58
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,920
In any job, it's sometimes good to think outside the box

59
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,840
or find new ways of doing things.

60
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,200
Bernadette thinks we should move away from just learning skills

61
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,680
and start using these skills creatively.

62
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,080
She used the expression redress the balance,

63
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,360
which means change things to make them fairer and more equal.

64
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,400
Well, here at the BBC, we have to be creative.

65
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,480
In fact, one of our values states that creativity is the life-blood of our organisation.

66
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,800
Life-blood here means the most important thing to make something a success.

67
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,360
Rob, I can see creativities in your blood,

68
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,360
but on an everyday level, how can we all improve our creativity

69
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,560
and be more like you?

70
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,159
Well, Neil, I'm no expert,

71
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,439
but Innovation Manager Nick Skillakorn is.

72
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:25,599
He's also been speaking to the BBC

73
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,319
and explaining what we can do to help ourselves.

74
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,280
What does he suggest?

75
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,599
On a daily basis, everyone should take 15 minutes

76
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,840
of what I call unfocused time.

77
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,240
Time that they're not looking at any screen,

78
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,759
time that they can essentially get back into their own head,

79
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,039
slow down a bit, and start forming these new connections

80
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,000
between disparate ideas that result in divergent

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,199
new original ideas.

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,080
So we need free time to collect all our different thoughts in our head.

83
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,240
What Nick calls disparate ideas to create new and amazing ideas.

84
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,840
disparate ideas are very different ideas, all unrelated.

85
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,159
And we need what we might call headspace.

86
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,920
That's when your mind is in a good state, and you can think clearly.

87
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,639
For me, I have headspace when I'm lying in the bar,

88
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,000
thought out riding my bike.

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,199
There are no interruptions.

90
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,840
Well, you certainly don't get your ideas sitting at a desk,

91
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,439
focusing on one task.

92
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,160
We all need some downtime to get creative.

93
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,840
But children going into school now will grow up to do a job

94
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,360
that doesn't yet exist,

95
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,639
and faced with the challenges of AI, automation,

96
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,959
green issues, and an aging population,

97
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:33,840
creativity and imagination will be vital.

98
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,519
Right, well, let's get back to talking about

99
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,920
the creativity of Banksy now.

100
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,720
Ah, yes.

101
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,000
Because earlier, I asked you which one of his well-known pieces

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,639
of artwork has been in the news recently?

103
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:49,039
Is it A, girl with balloon, B, girl with red balloon,

104
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,719
or C, balloon girl?

105
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:53,199
Hmm, and I said C, balloon girl.

106
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,279
I know it was a girl and a balloon.

107
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:57,439
Hmm, not quite right, Rob.

108
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:00,479
The artwork is titled Girl with Balloon.

109
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,399
This was recently auctioned in London,

110
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,360
but amazingly shredded in its frame

111
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,599
as someone's winning bid was accepted.

112
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,800
Wow, that's a very creative way to destroy a picture.

113
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,199
I'll do the same with this script soon,

114
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,039
but not before we have recapped

115
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,879
some of today's vocabulary.

116
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,639
Starting with a creative,

117
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,759
that's a person whose job is to use a lot of imagination

118
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,439
and come up with new ideas,

119
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:26,399
such as someone who works in the media or advertising.

120
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,399
Then we mentioned legitimately,

121
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,519
which describes doing something fairly and reasonably.

122
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,360
Next, we heard the expression,

123
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,800
redress the balance.

124
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,439
This means to make things fairer and more equal.

125
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,360
We also talked about creativity

126
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,839
being the lifeblood of the BBC.

127
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,159
Lifeblood here means the most important thing

128
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,759
to make something a success.

129
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,560
And I know creativity is running through your veins, Rob.

130
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,759
No, thanks, Neil.

131
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,439
We also heard the word disparate,

132
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:53,679
meaning very different and unrelated.

133
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:55,519
And we talked about headspace,

134
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,519
which is when your mind is in a good state

135
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,799
and you can think clearly.

136
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:01,120
Before we head off to find some headspace,

137
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,879

141
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:10,399
Do join us again, though. Goodbye.

142
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,599
Bye-bye.
