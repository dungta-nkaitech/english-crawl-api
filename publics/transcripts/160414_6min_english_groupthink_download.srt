5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,599
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English I'm Sophie

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,760
And I'm Neil. Here's a coffee Sophie

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,440
Neil, remember that staff meeting we had yesterday?

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,560
Why did you agree to having Deak have coffee in the kitchen

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,280
when I know you don't like it and neither do I?

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,839
I know. It's just that the boss said that Deak

11
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,880
caffeinated coffee, that's coffee with the caffeine removed.

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,280
It was a good idea, healthier you know.

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,320
And then everyone else agreed and I, I don't know,

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,280
I just felt uncomfortable disagreeing with everyone.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,520
Well it's interesting you should say that Neil.

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,920
Group Think is the subject of today's show.

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,840
Group Think refers to the type of bad decisions we make

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,000
when we are in a group. Decisions that are contrary to

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,240
or against what we really think.

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,719
A psychology experiment conducted in the 1950s

21
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,519
showed that a lot of people do exactly that.

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,840
They submit to the will of the group.

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,920
But before we hear more about this,

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,640
now would be a good time for today's quiz question

25
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,480
and I get to ask you Sophie.

26
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,159
Okay, what is it?

27
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,760
In which story by Hans Christian Andersen does a young boy

28
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,640
dare to tell the truth when everyone else goes along with an obvious lie?

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,200
Is it A, the red shoes?

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,120
B, the snow queen or C, the emperor's new clothes?

31
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,760
Okay, I think it's C, the emperor's new clothes.

32
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,439
Well, we'll find out later on in the show if that's right or not.

33
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,320
Now, the psychologist Solomon Ash is well known for his conformity experiments

34
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,320
from the 1950s. Can you tell us what conformity means please Sophie?

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,680
Conformity means behavior that is the same as the way most other people behave.

36
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,520
Ash's main finding was that group pressure

37
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,360
can change a person's opinion of even obvious facts.

38
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,600
And what did this ash test involve?

39
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,719
123 male participants were shown a card with a line on it,

40
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,640
followed by another card with three lines on it.

41
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,000
The participants were then asked to say which line

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,560
matched the line on the first card in length.

43
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
The right answer was plain to see,

44
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,680
but the participants felt pressurised into saying the wrong answer.

45
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,280
Why would they do that?

46
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,120
Because the majority of people taking part in the experiment

47
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,439
have been told to give the wrong answer.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,560
Let's hear Professor Nick Chaiter's explanation.

49
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,319
He works at the Warwick Business School here in the UK.

50
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:48,560
By the time it comes to you, a whole list of people have said something plainly wrong.

51
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,080
And you are either going to have to fold and say, well, I just agree with them,

52
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,159
or you're going to rather uncomfortably say, well, I think it's one actually.

53
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,560
And most people most of the time tend to fold.

54
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,319
Professor Nick Chaiter uses the word fold, which means you give up.

55
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,039
But Sophie, if people are uncomfortable about supporting the wrong answer

56
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,400
or something they don't believe in, why do they do it?

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,319
Because even though we might feel uncomfortable going along with

58
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,199
or agreeing with something we don't believe, we're even more uncomfortable

59
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:23,199
about disagreeing with the group.

60
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,479
Well, I didn't realise that people were such sheep.

61
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,719
I have a will of steel, Sophie.

62
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,159
Haha, that's right.

63
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:38,240
So your will of steel or strong determination somehow melted away in the staff meeting,

64
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,439
yes, did I suppose?

65
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,799
Ah, well, of course, yes, please.

66
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,680
Let's move on and consider briefly how social media encourages group things.

67
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,760
Yes, there's a real danger with something like, for example, the Twitter,

68
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,480
the social networking service, because when an opinion on Twitter starts to trend,

69
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,960
it can take on a momentum of its own and people adopt it simply because it's popular,

70
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,560
not because they really believe it.

71
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,680
And momentum means a force that keeps something going once it has started.

72
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,280
Let's hear from journalist and author John Ronson.

73
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,080
He has an interesting opinion about this.

74
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:21,519
One of the ironies here is that on social media, we all like to see ourselves as non-conformists,

75
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,240
but when we all get together in a group, what we're doing is using our individual non-conformity

76
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,399
to create a more conformist world.

77
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:38,000
So if somebody steps out of line, all us non-conformists in this frightened conformist way

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,160
tear them apart, it's like we're defining the boundaries of normality by tearing apart the people

79
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,120
on the outside.

80
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,279
John Ronson, are you a non-conformist then Neil?

81
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,959
Someone who thinks and behaves differently from other people?

82
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,600
I'm not the type that John Ronson's describing.

83
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,480
One who joins up with other so-called non-conformists to bully people with different views.

84
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,519
Now, remember I asked you earlier, in which story by Hans Christian Anderson

85
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:13,199
does a young boy dare to tell the truth when everyone else goes along with an obvious lie?

86
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,639
Is it A, the red shoes, B, the snow queen, or C, the emperor's new clothes?

87
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,759
I guess C, the emperor's new clothes.

88
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,560
And you were?

89
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,479
Right, so you think?

90
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,279
Yay!

91
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:30,560
The emperor's new clothes is a story by Hans Christian Anderson about two weavers who promise

92
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,159
an emperor a new suit of clothes that is invisible to those who are stupid or incompetent.

93
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,080
No one dares to say that he doesn't see any suit of clothes and sort of child cries out,

94
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,920
but he isn't wearing anything at all.

95
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,800
It's a great story and a lesson to us all.

96
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:49,840
Now, can we hear the words we learnt today please?

97
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,240
They are decaffeinated, group think, contrary to conformity,

98
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,600
fold, going along with, will of steel, momentum, non-conformist.

99
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,120
Well, that's the end of today's six-minute English.

100
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,280
Don't forget to join us again soon.

101
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,080
Bye-bye!
