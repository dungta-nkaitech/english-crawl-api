00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,599
Hello, I'm Rob and welcome to 6 Minute English,

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,879
where today we're chatting about a pedestrian topic

6
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,600
and six items are related vocabulary.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,519
Hello, I'm Neil. A pedestrian is someone who walks around

8
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,920
rather than travelling by car or bus,

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,800
but in Rob's sentence he used the adjective,

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,079
and in this context it means dull or uninteresting.

11
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,400
And of course I was making a pun, Neil,

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,760
because of course the show is going to be extremely interesting.

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,600
It's about safety on the streets,

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,359
and whether pedestrianisation is a good thing or not.

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,760
pedestrianisation means changing a street into an area

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,920
that can only be used by pedestrians.

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, it sounds like a good idea.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,560
No traffic, less noise and air pollution,

19
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,320
and no chance of getting knocked down by a car or a bus.

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,840
There are plans to pedestrianise Oxford Street,

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,719
which is one of the busiest shopping streets in London.

22
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,520
That's right, the mayor of London wants to tackle

23
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,920
or make an effort to deal with air pollution in this very busy spot,

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,320
where the amount of traffic is definitely a problem.

25
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,159
In fact, can you tell me, Neil, what's the average speed

26
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,640
of a bus travelling along Oxford Street?

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,680
Is it a 4.6 miles per hour?

28
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,760
B 14.6 miles per hour or C 46 miles per hour?

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,000
And I think it's 14.6 miles per hour.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,720
A sounds too slow and C sounds too fast.

31
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,600
Okay, we'll find out the answer later on.

32
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,719
The problem is the traffic doesn't just disappear.

33
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,320
You ban it from one area and it gets re-rooted somewhere else.

34
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,320
Ban means to say officially that something can't be done,

35
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,360
and re-root means to change the direction you're travelling in

36
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,599
in order to reach a particular destination.

37
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,040
That's true, Rob.

38
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,519
It must be a big headache for city planners.

39
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,319
Well, let's listen now to Joe Irvin,

40
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,719
chief executive of Living Streets.

41
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,199
He's going to talk some more about why traffic

42
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,759
is causing problems in our towns and cities.

43
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:17,599
In 1970, we had 20 million cars in this country.

44
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,360
Now we have over 30 million cars in such a short period.

45
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,879
So that creates three big problems.

46
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,359
One is space because we still got the same street structures in our towns and cities,

47
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:28,639
causing congestion.

48
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,919
It causes pollution which people are concerned about more and more.

49
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,519
And actually, it's kind of engineering walking and out of our lives.

50
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,359
So we're actually not getting enough exercise

51
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:38,879
which is a cause of a health crisis.

52
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,919
Smart cities are looking at pedestrianisation in Glasgow,

53
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,960
in Birmingham, in London, for example, Manchester.

54
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,519
As a way of not only making their places cities better and more attractive,

55
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,600
actually building their local economy.

56
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,400
So Neil Irvin identifies three problems.

57
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,080
The first is that our city streets have stayed the same

58
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,840
while the number of cars on the roads has increased dramatically.

59
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,520
That's right.

60
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,240
And this has led to congestion on our roads.

61
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,840
Congestion means too much traffic making it hard to move.

62
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,760
The second problem is pollution, which we mentioned earlier.

63
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,840
Pollution is damage to the environment,

64
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,159
caused by releasing waste substances,

65
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,319
such as carbon dioxide into the air.

66
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,719
And the third problem is that by travelling around on buses or in our cars,

67
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,960
we aren't getting enough exercise.

68
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,360
And we all know that's a bad thing.

69
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,759
Would pedestrianisation engineer walking back into our lives, do you think?

70
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,120
I'm not sure, Neil.

71
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,599
It would be great if we could go shopping or walk to work without breathing in fumes

72
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,840
or worrying about getting knocked down by a car.

73
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,360
But banning all motorised traffic from town centres

74
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,000
might make life difficult for people to get around.

75
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,520
Well, I'm not a town planner and I don't have the answers.

76
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,160
But I would like to know if I got the answer right to the question you asked me earlier.

77
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,920
Okay, well, I asked you, what's the average speed of a bus

78
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,520
travelling along Oxford Street?

79
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,400
Is it a 4.6 miles per hour,

80
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,120
b 14.6 miles per hour,

81
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,080
or c 46 miles per hour?

82
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,040
And I said 14.6 miles per hour.

83
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,520
And that's not slow enough, Neil, I'm afraid.

84
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,960
The answer is actually 4.6 miles per hour.

85
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,520
And we pedestrians walk at an average speed of 3.1 miles per hour, apparently.

86
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,360
Uh-oh, good to know.

87
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,320
Okay, shall we go over the words we learnt today, Rob?

88
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,120
Sure.

89
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,480
The first one is pedestrian, a person who is walking,

90
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,560
usually in an area where there's traffic.

91
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,040
Sorry, you can't ride your bike here.

92
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,120
The path is for pedestrians only.

93
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,600
The adjective, this book is full of very pedestrian ideas.

94
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,280
I wouldn't read it if I were you.

95
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,280
I've cross it off my list, Neil, thank you.

96
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,240
Okay, number two is to tackle something,

97
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,439
which means to make an effort to deal with a difficult problem.

98
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,759
For example, the government isn't really tackling the problem of air pollution.

99
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,759
It needs to do much more.

100
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:04,800
Very true.

101
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,800
Okay, ban means to say officially that something can't be done.

102
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,399
The UK government will ban the sale of diesel and petrol cars

103
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,079
from 2040.

104
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:19,279
And number four is re-root, which means to change the direction you're travelling in.

105
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,359
The council has re-rooted all buses to avoid the town centre.

106
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:27,599
Congestion is number five, too much traffic, making it difficult to move.

107
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,279
Road congestion always gets better in the summer when a lot of car drivers are on holiday.

108
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,560
That's true, isn't it?

109
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,199
London always seems emptier in July and August.

110
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,199
Except for all the tourists walking around,

111
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,479
congesting the streets.

112
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,439
Very funny.

113
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:43,839
And finally, number six is pollution,

114
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,920
which is damaged to the environment caused by releasing waste substances,

115
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,360
such as carbon dioxide into the air or plastic into the sea.

116
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,399
You can help produce air pollution by walking to work every day instead of driving.

117
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,399
You're talking to me, Neil.

118
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,759
I always walk to work.

119
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,120
I know you do, Rob.

120
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,719
You're an example to us all.

121
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:05,120
Okay, that's all we have time for today.

122
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,680
But please don't forget to visit us via our Twitter,

123
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,439
Facebook and YouTube pages.

124
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,079
Goodbye.

125
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,480
Bye-bye.
