Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish.com.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,320
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Sam.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,320
And I'm Rob.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,519
When someone feels sad or in a bad mood, they often try to feel better by eating their

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,519
favourite food. I usually go for a peanut butter sandwich myself.

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,839
Do you have a favourite comfort food, Rob?

7
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:29,079
Hmm, maybe a cream chocolate eclair.

8
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:35,240
Comfort food is a type of emotional eating. Eating lots of food because we feel sad, not because

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
we're hungry.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,719
But unfortunately, most comfort food is high in carbohydrates and sugar, and after a few

11
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,120
minutes, it leaves us feeling even worse than before.

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,400
Today, scientific research into the relationship between what we eat and how we feel is growing.

13
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:56,960
In this programme, we'll be investigating the connection between our food and our mood.

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,079
We'll hear how healthy eating makes us feel better, and of course, we'll be learning

15
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,079
some new vocabulary as well.

16
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:06,560
Great, but first I have a question for you, Sam.

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,759
People who link what we eat with how we feel make a simple argument. The food you eat

18
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:17,920
supplies nutrients and energy to the brain, and the brain controls our emotions.

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,040
Now that might sound simplistic, but the brain is a vital link in the connection between

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,040
food and our mood.

21
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,960
So Sam, my question is how much of the body's total energy is used up by the brain?

22
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,640
Is it a 10%, b 20% or c 30%.

23
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,480
Hmm, that's a good question. I'll say it's a 10%.

24
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,000
Right, well I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,719
Emotional eating is often caused by feelings of depression, anxiety or stress.

26
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:54,439
Chef Danny Edwards, who has suffered with depression, works in one of the most stressful

27
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:58,319
places imaginable, a busy, restaurant kitchen.

28
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:04,039
BBC World Service programme The Food Chain asked Danny about his eating habits at work.

29
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:07,359
Actually, when you're working in a kitchen environment for long periods, your appetite can

30
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:13,560
become suppressed because you sometimes don't want to eat or you don't feel like you

31
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,479
can stop and eat and all of that.

32
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:20,719
So it very often is grab and something on the go, which obviously as we know is not great

33
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:21,719
for us.

34
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:27,520
So you go for something that's quick, so hence why a lot of chefs have quite a bad diet.

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,199
Even though he's surrounded by food, Danny says that working under stress actually decreases

36
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,640
his appetite, the feeling that you want to eat food.

37
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,800
In a busy kitchen there's no time for a sit down meal, so Danny has to grab and go, take

38
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,200
something quickly because he doesn't have much time.

39
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,880
Although he knows this isn't very healthy.

40
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:54,160
So when even chefs have a difficult relationship with food, what about the rest of us?

41
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,600
Professor Feliz Jacka is an expert in nutritional psychiatry.

42
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,680
She studied the effect of eating a healthy diet.

43
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,680
Food such as fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grain cereals and olive oil, on people

44
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,480
suffering depression.

45
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:13,840
Professor Jacka found that the patients whose mental health improved were the same patients

46
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,079
who had also improved their diet.

47
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:20,039
But Professor Jacka's ideas were not accepted by everyone.

48
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:25,799
Here she explains to Jordan Dunbar, presenter of BBC World Services, the food chain, about

49
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,599
the opposition her study faced from other doctors.

50
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,759
So I proposed to do this for my PhD study and everyone thought I was a bit bananas,

51
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:39,120
you know, and there was quite a bit of, I guess, eye-rolling maybe.

52
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,639
I'm not surprised by that because the discipline of psychiatry was very medication and brain-focused.

53
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:48,039
What did people say in the field?

54
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,039
Were they skeptical?

55
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,479
Oh, hugely skeptical.

56
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:54,599
And sometimes very patronizing.

57
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:59,919
But this again comes from the fact that general practitioners, psychiatrists, medical specialists

58
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,719
get almost no nutrition training through all those years of study.

59
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:10,400
When Professor Jacka investigated the link between food and mood, her colleagues thought she

60
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,719
was bananas, a slang word meaning silly or crazy.

61
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:20,639
They rolled their eyes, a phrase which describes the gesture of turning her eyes upwards to express

62
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,360
annoyance, boredom or disbelief.

63
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,519
Other colleagues were patronizing.

64
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,319
They behaved towards her as if she were stupid or unimportant.

65
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,959
Professor Jacka thinks this is because most doctors have little or no training about nutrition

66
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:38,920
and the effect of food on mental health.

67
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,759
But her groundbreaking research, named The Smile Trial, has been successfully repeated

68
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,920
elsewhere, clearly showing the link between eating well and feeling good.

69
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,920
So the next time you're feeling down and your brain is calling out for a doughnut, you

70
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,959
might be better eating an apple instead.

71
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:02,279
And speaking of brain, Sam, it's time to reveal the answer to my question.

72
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:08,479
Aha, yes, you asked me how much of the body's energy is used up by the brain.

73
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,519
And I guess it was 10%.

74
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,680
Well I'm afraid you are wrong.

75
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,719
In fact, around 20% of the body's energy goes to feeding the brain, even though it only

76
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:20,879
makes up 2% of our total body weight.

77
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,639
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from our discussion about emotional eating.

78
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,959
It's eating too much food because of how you feel, not because you're hungry.

79
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,039
Appetite is the desire to eat food.

80
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:39,120
If you grab and go, you take something quickly because you don't have much time.

81
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,039
Calling someone bananas is slang for silly or crazy.

82
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:49,519
If you roll your eyes, you move your eyes upwards to show you feel annoyed, bored or don't

83
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,319
believe what someone is telling you.

84
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,800
And finally, if someone is patronising you, they speak or behave towards you as if you

85
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,800
were stupid or unimportant.

86
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,199
That's the end of our programme.

87
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,040
Don't forget to join us again soon for more topic or discussion and useful vocabulary

88
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,639
here at 6 Minute English.

89
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,639
Bye everyone.

90
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,639
Bye bye.
