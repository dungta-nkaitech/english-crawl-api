from BBCLearningEnglish.com

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,679
Hello, I'm Neil and welcome to 6 Minute English.

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,160
Where today we bring you a serious topic and six items of vocabulary.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,440
And hello, I'm Rob.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,920
Now, here's a serious question for you, Neil.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,839
Have you thought about what you'd like to happen when you die?

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,559
Interesting way to start the show, Rob.

11
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,479
No, I haven't.

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,200
Well, nobody really likes to talk about death, do they?

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,359
Well, it isn't a fun topic.

14
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:39,359
So can we talk about something else, please?

15
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,960
Afraid not, because today's topic is funerals.

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,240
A funeral is a ceremony we hold for a dead person.

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,000
And a ceremony is a formal event performed on special occasions,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,840
like a wedding or a graduation, or in this case, a funeral.

19
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay, well, let's start with a quiz question.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,160
According to a UK survey,

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,880
how many of us would like our funerals to be more of a party or celebration?

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,560
Is it a 5%, b 25% or c 50%.

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,680
Well, I think it's 25%.

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,800
I hadn't thought about it before, but I definitely prefer my funeral to be a celebration

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,800
with my favourite music playing and definitely nobody wearing black.

26
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,640
Well, strangely enough, a friend of mine went to a funeral recently

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,560
where the funeral director was dressed as Darth Vader from Star Wars.

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,399
Hmm, that sounds wrong.

29
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:33,920
But I guess people are choosing to move away from the traditional funeral,

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,359
you know, in church, people dressed in black or very quiet.

31
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,920
Darth Vader does wear black, at least.

32
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,280
Anyway, let's hear from Shoney Sullivan here in the UK

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,599
talking about the fancy dress funeral she and her sister organised for their mother.

34
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:52,719
It was quite unusual as we turned up in fancy dress.

35
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:58,000
Had your mum left any instructions about how she wanted her funeral to be?

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,560
Only that we don't cry and we're to have a party,

37
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,840
just celebrate her life, be happy, don't be sad.

38
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,599
I was a witch.

39
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,799
How did you look?

40
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:12,879
Oh, it was just like a little black dress and I just had like a little fancy

41
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:18,400
witch hat on at the same time as my sister and we had a very close friend of the family come

42
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,319
as Beetlejuice, which was absolutely amazing.

43
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,079
He really did go all out for that.

44
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,799
So, fancy dress, special clothes you wear to an event,

45
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:32,079
to look like a famous person or character from a movie.

46
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:37,439
Another word we use is costume, which is a set of clothes you wear to look like somebody else.

47
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,840
Shoney and her sister chose a Halloween theme for the funeral and what

48
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,439
witches costumes, little black dresses with special hats.

49
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:48,240
A close family relative dressed as Beetlejuice.

50
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:52,800
Did he dress as a squashed in-sect Neil and I'm a bit confused here?

51
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,000
No, Rob. He dressed as Beetlejuice, the main character in a popular 1980s movie.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,240
Beetlejuice is a ghost who wears crazy clothes and has scary hair and makeup.

53
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,439
I haven't seen the film, but what does Shoney mean when she says her relative went all out with his

54
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:08,319
costume?

55
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,799
To go all out means to make a big effort, and this guy's costume involved not only

56
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,000
special clothes, but special hair and makeup too.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,280
Ah, like me. What do you mean like me?

58
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,400
Well, I go all out to get my clothes and hair just right for six minute English.

59
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,159
Yes, and well, you look great, Rob, but unfortunately nobody sees us do they?

60
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,199
Ah yes, good point. But it's important to make an effort.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So, have you had any thoughts about the sort of funeral you would like to have?

62
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,599
Oh, yes, I like the thought of my friends and family,

63
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,599
saying their final goodbyes to me on a beach with a beautiful sunset,

64
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,400
listening to Stay Away to Heaven by Led Zeppelin.

65
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,680
Okay, well, before you get too carried away with ideas for your own funeral,

66
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,400
let's have the answer to today's quiz question.

67
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,159
To get carried away means to get very excited and lose control of your feelings.

68
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,400
Hmm, I never thought I would get excited about my own funeral.

69
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,719
But anyway, yes, back to today's question,

70
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,040
how many of us would like our funerals to be more of a party or celebration?

71
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,560
Is it a 5%, b 25% or c 50%?

72
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,280
And I said 25%.

73
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,680
No, it's actually 50%.

74
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,079
The market research company ICN found that half of us here in the UK

75
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,680
would prefer something different to the traditional funeral.

76
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,360
More than I expected.

77
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,439
Okay, shall we look back at the words we have learned today?

78
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,600
Yep. First up, funeral.

79
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,160
A ceremony we hold for a dead person.

80
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,240
The plural is funerals.

81
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,360
Fancy dress funerals aren't everybody's cup of tea.

82
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,360
The adjective is funereal.

83
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
Notice the stress on the second syllable.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,160
Who chose this funereal music?

85
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,480
Can we change it to something more cheerful?

86
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,920
Not my cup of tea, by the way, is something you don't enjoy doing.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,560
Okay, ceremony, a formal event performed on special occasions.

88
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,199
I didn't go to my sister's graduation ceremony.

89
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,240
In the UK, the opening of Parliament is a ceremonious occasion.

90
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,640
Ceremonious is the adjective.

91
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,240
Number three, fancy dress is special clothing you wear to an event.

92
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,319
For example, to look like a famous person or character from a movie.

93
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,720
I've been invited to a fancy dress party.

94
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,720
Oh, who are you going as, Rob?

95
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,680
It's a secret, Neil.

96
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,319
Number four, costume.

97
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,360
A set of clothes you wear to look like somebody else.

98
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,680
Rob is going to go to the fancy dress party in a superman costume.

99
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,879
Ha, good guess.

100
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,040
Right, number five, to go all out means to make a big effort.

101
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,759
We went all out this year with our Christmas decorations,

102
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,720
with our life-size flashing Santa Claus and sleigh.

103
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,759
Now, way to go, Neil.

104
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:55,120
Number six, the phrasal verb to get carried away means to get very excited and lose control of your feelings.

105
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,319
She got carried away and painted the whole house pink.

106
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,759
That must be Barbie's house.

107
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:00,160
Yep.

108
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,879
And fancy dresses definitely Barbies cup of tea.

109
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,480
Okay, that's all for today,

110
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,360
but please remember to check out our Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages.

111
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,399
Okay, bye-bye.

112
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,040
Goodbye.
