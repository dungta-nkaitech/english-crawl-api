00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,320
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:20,160
And I'm Beth. There's a famous English saying, a friend in need is a friend indeed. And it's

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,080
true. Everyone needs friends to share life's ups and downs. Do you have many friends, Neil?

5
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,719
Yes, I have some close friends, but maybe not as many as I'd like.

6
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:37,000
That's interesting, because often it's women who have many friends, while men find it harder

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,560
to maintain strong friendships, especially as they get older. In fact, according to one

8
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:50,679
recent survey, only 27% of British men say they have at least six close friends.

9
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:56,840
So is it true that men find it difficult to make friends? We'll be hearing from Max Dickens,

10
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,359
author of a book on male friendship called Billy No Mates. And as usual, we'll be learning

11
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:04,799
some useful new vocabulary as well.

12
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,799
But first, I have a question for you. We know that place friends are important, not just

13
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,280
for having fun, but for good mental health as well. So according to research by Oxford

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,200
University's Institute of Cognitive Anthropology, how many close friends do we need for our

15
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:32,480
mental well-being? Is it A, 5, B, 10 or C, 20?

16
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,640
I'll say we need at least five close friends.

17
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,240
Okay, Neil. I'll reveal the answer at the end of the programme. Now, however many

18
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:47,439
friends you have, it's a stereotype that women are better than men at making and keeping

19
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:54,000
close friends. Here's Claudia Hammond outlining the problem for BBC Radio 4 programme all

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,479
in the mind.

21
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:59,280
Now, when times are tough, friends are often the people who get us through who are there

22
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,959
to listen to reassure, maybe to advise us if that's what we want. So why do we sometimes

23
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,719
find it hard to make friends? Although the friends we used to have seem to have somehow

24
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:15,280
drifted away. Now, there is an idea that women are much better at maintaining their friendships

25
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,639
and that men are more likely to hang out with whoever is around rather than to nurture

26
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,840
those relationships. And we were wondering whether this was really true or is that just

27
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,240
a stereotype.

28
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:31,800
Claudia uses the phrase times are tough to describe a situation of trouble, unhappiness or

29
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,039
financial difficulty. Friends help us get through these difficult periods of life. The

30
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:43,599
phrasal verb get through has several meanings, but here it means manage to live through an

31
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,280
unpleasant period of time.

32
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,519
The problem may be that your friends have drifted away, gradually moved further and further

33
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,120
away until your connection with them has broken. And it seems that's especially true

34
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
for men.

35
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,879
That's right, when author Max Dickens was getting married, he realised he didn't have

36
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,280
any close male friends he could ask to be his best man, the person who helps the groom

37
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,759
at a wedding. This led him to write the book Billy No Mates looking at why he didn't have

38
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:20,280
any close male friends. Here's Claudia Hammond again talking with Max for BBC Radio 4 program

39
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
all in the mind.

40
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,519
And Max, it's interesting that you kind of went public on this if you like. Your book

41
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,199
is even called Billy No Mates, the very thing that a lot of us would dread being. It can't

42
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:33,119
have been easy to decide to say this publicly anyway.

43
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:37,199
No, it's a real double edshaw being the face of a book called Billy No Mates, I've got

44
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:46,639
to say. But I think, so loneliness doesn't look like me. I'm in my early to mid 30s, I'm

45
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:51,919
pretty outgoing, I'm quick to buy my round. It shouldn't look like me, but increasingly

46
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:57,839
it does. So loneliness isn't just the elderly anymore, it's younger people.

47
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,879
Max called his book Billy No Mates, slang for a person with no friends. It's a memorable

48
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:10,400
book title, but Max says being the public face of a book called Billy No Mates is a double

49
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,319
edged sword, something with unfavorable as well as favourable consequences.

50
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:22,360
In fact, Max doesn't look like someone with no friends, he's young, generous and outgoing,

51
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,520
and adjective describing someone who's friendly and enjoys meeting people. But increasingly,

52
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,319
loneliness is affecting younger men, thanks partly to social media, which can make it

53
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:39,040
seem as though everyone is having a great time with their mates, except you.

54
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,160
Max thinks the answer is getting out and meeting people in third spaces, places like sports

55
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,439
clubs or reading groups, which are separate from either home or work.

56
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:54,759
All of which helps get closer to the magical number of friends needed for good mental

57
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:59,160
health. I think it's time you revealed the answer to your question, Beth.

58
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,199
Yes, I asked how many close friends we need for our mental wellbeing. You said it was

59
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:13,040
five, which was the correct answer. According to Oxford University's Professor Robin Dunbar,

60
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:19,879
we need a core circle of five close friends. Plus a wider support network of about ten,

61
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:24,439
making a total number of fifteen friends for good mental health.

62
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:30,040
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from the programme, starting with the phrase times our

63
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,680
tough, which describes periods of trouble or difficulty in life.

64
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,040
If you get through something, you manage to live through a difficult situation.

65
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:45,399
To drift away means to gradually move further apart from someone until your relationship

66
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,399
with them eventually ends.

67
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,159
Clearly no mate is slang for someone who has no friends.

68
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:56,879
A double-edged sword describes something with unfavorable as well as favourable consequences.

69
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,079
And finally, the adjective outgoing describes someone who is very friendly and enjoys talking

70
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,439
to people.

71
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,000
Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now.

72
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Bye.
