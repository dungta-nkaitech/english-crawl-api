00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,679
Hello, this is 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:16,800
And I'm Rob.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,359
What do you remember of your teenage years?

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,160
Oh, I was a nightmare.

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,519
I was rude to my parents, always stayed out late,

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,480
never did my homework, hung out with the wrong people,

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,519
and made lots of bad decisions. How about you, Neil?

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,280
Well, much the same, really.

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,840
People always say that about teenagers, don't they?

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,520
That they go through a period when they're out of control and behave badly.

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,760
But, apparently, it's not their fault, at least not directly.

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,359
So, who's fault is it?

17
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:47,120
Our brains, apparently.

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,280
Teenagers' brains are still developing in areas that control behaviour,

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,480
which could mean that you can't blame them for acting the way they do.

20
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:58,479
Before we find out more, let's have our question.

21
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,359
There have always been teenagers, but when was the word teenager first used

22
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,640
to refer to the 13 to 19-age group?

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,640
Was it A, the 1920s?

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,159
B, the 1930s?

25
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,120
Or C, the 1950s? Any ideas, Rob?

26
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,719
Well, I think it came along around the time of rock and roll,

27
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,239
so that would have made it the 1950s. That's my guess.

28
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,239
I'll have the answer later in the programme.

29
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:27,280
Sarah Jane Blakemore from University College London specialises in the workings of the brain,

30
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,640
particularly the teenage brain. Recently, she was a guest on the BBC Radio programme,

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,839
The Life Scientific. She explained that the understanding that the brain is still developing

32
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:42,959
during the teenage years is quite new. When does she say the first research came out?

33
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,319
The first study is showing that the human brain undergoes this very substantial and

34
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,599
significant development throughout adolescence in the 20s. The first papers were published in

35
00:01:53,599 --> 00:02:00,319
the late 90s. Before that, and for example, when I was at university, the dogma in the textbooks

36
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:05,119
was that the vast majority of brain development goes on in the first few years of life and nothing

37
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,280
much changes after mid childhood. That dogma is completely false.

38
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,000
So, when did the research into the teenage brain come out?

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,400
Surprisingly, it wasn't until the late 1990s. This was when she said that the first papers on

40
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,719
this subject were published. Papers in this context means the results of scientific research which

41
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,120
are published. And she didn't actually talk about teenagers, did she?

42
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,039
No, that's right. She talked about the period of adolescence. This noun, adolescence,

43
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:42,319
is the period when someone is developing from a child into an adult. And it more or less is the

44
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,959
same as the teenage years. What I found interesting was that before the 1990s, people believed something

45
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,479
different about the way our brains develop. Yes, Professor Blake Moore said that the dogma

46
00:02:54,479 --> 00:03:00,079
had been that our brains are mostly fully developed in early childhood, long before adolescence.

47
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:06,639
Dogma is a word used to describe a strong belief that people are expected to accept as true.

48
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,439
So, our brains are still developing much later than was originally thought.

49
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,280
What does this tell us about teenage behaviour? Of particular interest is an important part of

50
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,800
the brain called the prefrontal cortex. Here's Professor Blake Moore again. What excuse can she give

51
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,759
for teenagers who don't get their homework done in time? The prefrontal cortex is the part of the

52
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:33,039
brain right at the front just behind the forehead. And it's involved in a whole range of very high

53
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:39,199
level cognitive tasks such as decision-making and planning. We know that this region is undergoing

54
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:44,319
very, very large amount of development during the adolescent years. And so in terms of the

55
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,959
expectations that we place on teenagers to, for example, plan their homeworks might be too much

56
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,000
given that we know that the region of the brain that's critically involved in planning

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,679
is not developed yet. So, the prefrontal cortex is important in cognitive tasks. What are those, Rob?

58
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,480
A cognitive task is one that requires conscious thinking and processing, such as making decisions

59
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,639
and planning. It doesn't happen automatically. You have to think about it. So in the adolescent years,

60
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,240
this part of the brain is not fully developed. Note the adjective form here of the now we had earlier,

61
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,920
adolescence. So, this gives a good excuse for not doing your homework? I wish I'd known that.

62
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,439
I used to say that I'd left my homework on the bus or that the dog could eat in it. Now I could say,

63
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,560
sorry sir, my brain isn't developed enough for the cognitive task of planning my homework.

64
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,920
Yes, I'm sure that would work. Before we wrap up, time to get the answer to this week's question.

65
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:50,720
I asked when was the word teenager first used to refer to the 13 to 19 age group? Was it A,

66
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:59,519
the 1920s, B, the 1930s, or C, the 1950s? Rob, you said? I guess C, the 1950s.

67
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:06,240
And the answer is actually B, the 1930s. Very well done if you knew that.

68
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,399
Now a quick review of today's vocabulary. Adolescence is the noun for the period of change from

69
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:18,639
child to adult and the adjective is adolescent. This same word is also the noun for someone who

70
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:25,439
is in the teenage period. So an adolescent might be responsible for adolescent behavior in his or her

71
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:33,120
adolescence. Exactly. Papers is the word for published scientific research. Dogma is strongly

72
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,720
held beliefs that are not challenged. The prefrontal cortex is an important part of the brain which

73
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,759
deals with cognitive tasks. And cognitive tasks are mental processes that require active thought and

74
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,199
consideration, such as planning and making decisions. Well, my decision-making skills tell me that

75
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:57,839
it's time to finish. Well, your skills are working well, Neil. We may be going now, but you

76
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,519
don't need to. You can listen or watch us again and find lots more learning English materials
