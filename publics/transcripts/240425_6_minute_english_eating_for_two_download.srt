00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,400
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Phil.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,080
And I'm Georgie.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,679
If you ask a woman, are you eating for two?

5
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:20,640
The phrase has a very specific meaning.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,359
You're asking, are you pregnant?

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,960
And like many of the idioms we commonly use in English,

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,080
this phrase contains a little bit of truth.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,600
A pregnant woman really is eating for two,

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,799
herself and the baby growing inside her.

11
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,840
The female human body is amazing.

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,560
During pregnancy, it protects the growing baby

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,880
by allowing it to take whatever nutrients it needs from the mother.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,840
This means it's the mum to be, not the baby,

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,040
who experiences any nutritional problems.

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,719
It's also the reason why it's so important that pregnant women

17
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,079
In this programme, we'll be finding out

18
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,480
how a woman's relationship to food changes during pregnancy.

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,439
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary too.

20
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,159
But first, I have a question for you, Phil.

21
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,159
For some pregnant women, finding reliable information

22
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,560
on what food to eat can be hard.

23
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,680
Finding out about harmful foods to avoid on the other hand is much easier.

24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,560
So, according to NHS recommendations,

25
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,000
which of these foods should pregnant women not eat?

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,360
Is it A, chips, B, oily fish, or C, smoked salmon?

27
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,280
I think the answer is C, smoked salmon.

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,280
Okay, Phil, we'll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme.

29
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,719
Although eating healthy and nutritious food is important for mums and babies,

30
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,600
the story gets complicated because of the changes

31
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:54,000
a woman's body goes through during pregnancy.

32
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:59,359
Here's Jagger Wise, presenter of BBC Radio 4's The Food programme,

33
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,759
reporting on her experience of pregnancy.

34
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,560
I feel like throughout this pregnancy, my body is just gone a bit haywire

35
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,919
and there are things that my body is doing.

36
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:11,919
That's frankly weird.

37
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,759
Nose bleeds is a really good example.

38
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,079
Yeah, I can count the amount of nose bleeds pre-pregnancy I've had on one hand,

39
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,000
and now I seem to get them all the time.

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,440
Jagger says that during pregnancy, her body went haywire.

41
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,439
It stopped working properly.

42
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,600
For example, she had lots of nose bleeds, whereas before being pregnant,

43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,439
she could count the number of nose bleeds she had on one hand.

44
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,880
The idiom to count the number of something on one hand

45
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,080
emphasises that this doesn't happen very often,

46
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,080
or that there's a small number of something.

47
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,760
After all, you can only count to five on one hand,

48
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,360
many pregnant women experience cravings.

49
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,080
The strong desire for some particular food,

50
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,320
anything from ice cream to sardines.

51
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,160
When these cravings offer food that's not so healthy,

52
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,640
some women feel guilty, thinking, I know I should be eating healthy,

53
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,080
but all I want is chips.

54
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,840
Here's Jagger Wise again, speaking with nutritional therapist Henrietta Wilson,

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,400
on the best way to deal with guilty feelings.

56
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,560
How guilty should you feel?

57
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,879
It's more the question.

58
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,520
For that late night chocolate binge,

59
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,280
when your body is telling you, you need cake.

60
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,840
Listen, I think the most important thing is to not get out the cast of nintails,

61
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,240
is to absolutely be kind to yourself.

62
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,599
Particularly in that first trimester, it is a very critical window,

63
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,120
but at the same time, it can be the time when all you want to do is to eat chips,

64
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,680
because your body is going through what it perceives to be physiological stress.

65
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,800
So it's doing the best that you can, and it's absolutely not about giving yourself a hard time.

66
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,000
Jagger's food cravings led to a chocolate binge.

67
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,120
A binge is an occasion where you do something in an extreme way,

68
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,680
like eating or drinking too much.

69
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,120
Henrietta's advice is to not use the catternine tails.

70
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,840
In the past, the catternine tails was a whip made of nine strings,

71
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,680
which was used to punish prisoners.

72
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,079
Nowadays, when someone talks about the catternine tails,

73
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,560
they are probably talking about the ways people sometimes use to punish themselves

74
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,079
if they feel guilty.

75
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:29,040
But says Henrietta, pregnancy isn't about giving yourself a hard time,

76
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,759
treating itself badly or criticising yourself.

77
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,720
Pregnancy is a special time of life, and all a baby can ask if the mum does her best,

78
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,920
and of course avoids some foods, which reminds me of your question, Georgie.

79
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,200
Which food does the NHS recommend pregnant women do not eat?

80
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,600
I guess it was smoked salmon.

81
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,160
Which was the correct answer?

82
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Smoked salmon is best avoided because of the risk of bacteria,

83
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,960
but oily fish is good, and even a bowl of chips now and then are fine.

84
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,360
Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in the program.

85
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,280
Starting with the idiom, eating for two, which means to be pregnant.

86
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,759
If something goes haywire, it stops working properly or becomes difficult to control.

87
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,400
If you say you could count something on one hand,

88
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,080
you're emphasising that something does not happen very often,

89
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,560
or that there are only a few of those things.

90
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,879
A binge is an occasion when you do something to excess.

91
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:34,879
For example, eat, drink, or spend money.

92
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,600
In the past, the catanine tails was a whip used to punish prisoners,

93
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,240
but nowadays it usually refers to the ways in which someone criticises themselves as a form of self-punishment.

94
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,240
And finally, to give yourself a hard time,

95
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,240
means to treat yourself badly by criticising or blaming yourself.

96
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:57,519
Once again, our six minutes are up.

97
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:03,120

99
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,280
Goodbye for now.

100
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,079
Bye!
