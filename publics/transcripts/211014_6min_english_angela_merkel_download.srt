Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

3
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:22,640
And I'm Neil. In this program, we're talking about a famous leader

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,320
and teaching you some useful vocabulary. Like Chancellor, the person in the highest position in a

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,600
government or university, and especially the title for the head of government in some European

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,600
countries. A country such as Germany. It's a position like the pro minister in the UK.

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,560
And one of Germany's longest serving chancellors was Angela Merkel, who led the country from 2005

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,000
until the recent elections in September 2021. Well, we're going to find out more about

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,159
her soon, but not before I've challenged you to answer this question, Neil.

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:02,719
Who was Germany's first ever Chancellor? Was it A, also von Bismarck?

11
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:07,840
B, Helmut Schmidt? Or C, Franz von Pappen?

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,760
Well, my knowledge of German history isn't great, but I'll go for A, Otto von Bismarck.

13
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,879
That sounds quite likely. Okay, I'll reveal the answer later on.

14
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,799
But let's talk more about Angela Merkel now. She was an office for 16 years.

15
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,599
An office means in power or in charge until she stepped down last month.

16
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,319
Yes, that's a long time, which meant she had to make lots of decisions,

17
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:36,719
popular with some people and not with others.

18
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:42,159
Over that time, she's gained a nickname, Mutti, German for mother.

19
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,280
This could be seen as a compliment, but started life as more of an insult,

20
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:54,079
as BBC correspondent, Damien McGuinness, explained on the BBC radio program from our own correspondent.

21
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:00,640
The mummy Merkel image, in fact, started off as an insult from conservative rivals.

22
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,159
It was made up during her first term in office by hard-line conservatives in her predominantly male

23
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,000
party, a patronising putdown behind her back to put her in her place as a woman,

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,240
possibly even meant to be hurtful, given that in reality she has no children.

25
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,360
Oh dear, so the nickname of mother was really used as an insult to start with,

26
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,320
probably invented by the men in her political party, described as the hard-line conservatives,

27
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,120
ones with traditional and strict beliefs that can't be changed.

28
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,520
Yes, the nickname was used as a putdown. That's an insult used to make someone feel stupid or

29
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,960
embarrassed, and the intention was to make her feel less important or to put her in her place.

30
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,680
Well, politics is full of insults and critics, but it sounds rather cruel.

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,719
And Damien McGuinness does go on to say that this image is really a media myth and not quite accurate.

32
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,200
But the media has not always been negative about Angela Merkel. She is the longest serving amongst

33
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:10,080
current EU leaders and participated in an estimated 100 EU summits. She's often been labelled

34
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,719
as the only grown-up in the room, so the media has called her the queen of Europe.

35
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,320
What is true is that following the recent elections in Germany, her successor,

36
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:26,480
the person who became Chancellor, will lack the experience and gravitas that Merkel has gained

37
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,920
over his 16 years as Chancellor. But Damien McGuinness, in his report for the BBC's

38
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,640
from our own correspondent programme, concludes that many people aren't sure which of her

39
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:42,239
nicknames is accurate. What word does he use to mean phrases or ideas that have become

40
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,239
meaningless because they've been overused? But the confusion around these cliches does point

41
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,000
to another truth. The Chancellor is discreet the point of sometimes being invisible,

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,119
so there's a fascination about what's really going on behind that deadpan exterior.

43
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:04,319
Angela Merkel may have been in power for more than a decade and a half, but people are still not

44
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:12,159
really sure they know who she is. He used the word key shades to mean phrases or ideas that

45
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,600
have become meaningless because they've been overused. People are unsure which description of

46
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,920
her is true because she is discreet. She keeps quiet about things, so as not to attract attention.

47
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,759
Yes, it's hard to know what she's thinking because she looks deadpan. That means she looks

48
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:36,959
serious. She doesn't show expression or emotion. No wonder if Germany's first ever Chancellor had

49
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:44,480
a deadpan exterior. Ah, yes. Earlier you asked me who that was and I said Otto von Bismarck. Was I right?

50
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:52,319
Yes, you were. Well done. Vunderbar. Now it's time to recap some of the vocabulary we've mentioned

51
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,759
today starting with Chancellor, the person in the highest position in a government in some countries.

52
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:03,680
Hardline describes someone with traditional and strict beliefs that can't be easily changed.

53
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,639
A put down is an insult used to make someone feel stupid or embarrassed.

54
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,480
When someone is put in their place, they are made to feel less important than they are.

55
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:20,800
Key shades are phrases or ideas that have become meaningless because they've been overused

56
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,199
and deadpan describes someone's serious facial expression that shows no emotion.

57
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:31,920
