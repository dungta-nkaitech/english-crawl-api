00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,560
From BBC Learning English

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,439
Hello, this is 6 Minute English

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:17,920
from BBC Learning English. I'm Rob.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,039
And I'm Sam.

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,199
Have you got a business brain, Sam?

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,280
Would you like to start your own business?

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,679
It sounds good, Rob. I like the idea of being my own boss.

11
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,920
Well, that's the dream for many millennials.

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,719
The name given to the current generation of young people,

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,200
aged between 24 and 38.

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,719
Some of the millennial generation are dissatisfied

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,200
with the old ways of doing things.

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,439
For example, how big business uses data from social media

17
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:50,240
and the negative impact of companies on society and the environment.

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,840
In today's programme, we'll look at why millennials are so attracted

19
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,680
to starting their own businesses

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,520
and asking whether this really is the way to make the world a better place.

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,440
And of course, we'll be learning some new vocabulary on the way.

22
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,120
But first, it's time for today's quiz question.

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,640
At 79 years old, Mohamed Yunus is hardly a millennial,

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,799
but he's a hero to many young business people.

25
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,200
In 2006, he won the Nobel Peace Prize.

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,799
But what for? Was it for a offering microfinance to low-income businesses?

27
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,319
Be starting the first business to earn £1 million in under a week,

28
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,319
or see developing a progressive model of taxation.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,640
I know millennials like starting businesses,

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,039
so I'll say be earning £1 million in under a week.

31
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:46,000
Okay, we'll find out later if you were right.

32
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,239
Now, whether it's TV shows like The Apprentice,

33
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,239
or the big success of companies in California's Silicon Valley,

34
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:59,679
the last decades are a huge growth in 20 and 30-year-olds starting their own businesses.

35
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,280
BBC World Service Programme The Wife Actor

36
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,479
asked Business Professor Ethan Mollick to explain how this situation came about.

37
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,759
There's all these platforms that let you build entrepreneurial ventures,

38
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,599
much more easily. The growth of things like crowdfunding

39
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,519
have helped make entrepreneurship more accessible,

40
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:21,199
and led to tons of new startups.

41
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,560
So there's a lot of new methods for launching businesses,

42
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,199
and the cost of launching businesses dropped at the same time.

43
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,399
Ethan lists some of the reasons why it's now easier to become an entrepreneur,

44
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:36,799
someone who starts their own business, often after seeing a new opportunity.

45
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:44,079
Entrepreneurs see opportunities for products and services not being supplied by existing companies,

46
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:50,319
so they create startups, newly formed businesses intended to grow rapidly

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,359
by providing for a particular market gap.

48
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:56,479
One of the main problems to starting up your own business

49
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,280
used to be getting the large amounts of money needed.

50
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,199
But nowadays, this can be solved with crowdfunding,

51
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:09,120
getting the funding for a new business by asking a large number of people to give small amounts

52
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,199
of money, usually via the internet.

53
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,879
But while startups' success stories have made going into business a good option,

54
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,560
for many millennials it's not just about making money,

55
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,639
but also about being socially responsible and doing good.

56
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,759
However, others argue that most big changes for the better

57
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,039
have come from governments, not millennial businesses.

58
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,039
Here, former World Bank economist Charles Kenney,

59
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:42,319
caution against over-emphasising individual business over governments.

60
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,199
If you are working in a place with a corrupt and inefficient government,

61
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:52,079
one of the best ways you can push development in your countries to try and make that problem

62
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,400
a little bit better, it's not something that anyone individual can do, it has to be a collective

63
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,039
effort. But the more we have, young, committed, smart people who want to make the world a better place,

64
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:07,680
working in government, the more likely government is to start delivering the kind of services we

65
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,719
need in order to ensure a high quality of life in that country.

66
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,680
So Charles mentions the problem that governments can be corrupt,

67
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,560
acting morally wrong or illegal ways, often in return for money or power.

68
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,759
The talent and passion that millennials put into starting their own business

69
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,160
could instead be used to improve governments through collective effort,

70
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,959
a group of people acting together to achieve a common goal.

71
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:39,680
It's this working together that can raise people's quality of life,

72
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,240
level of personal satisfaction and comfort.

73
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,480
Something that Muhammad Yunus was doing.

74
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,240
Ah yes, that's today's quiz question. I asked you why Muhammad Yunus won the Nobel Prize

75
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,439
in 2006. I said that B, he started the first business to earn 1 million in under a week.

76
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,160
But in fact, it was A, offering microfinance to low income businesses.

77
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,879
A way for anyone, rich or poor, to run a business in a positive way.

78
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,639
So today we've been talking about why young people in the millennial generation want to be

79
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:21,040
entrepreneurs, people who start their own business. Many millennials create startups,

80
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:27,120
newly formed businesses intended to grow rapidly using a method called crowdfunding,

81
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,399
getting the funding for their new business by asking large numbers of people on the internet

82
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,319
to each give a little bit of money.

83
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:40,560
But it's not only about making profits, millennial startups can help solve many of the developing

84
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,120
world's problems instead of governments which may be corrupt, acting immorally or illegally

85
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,959
for money or power. What's needed more than individual businessmen and women is collective

86
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,519
effort, a group of people acting together to achieve a common goal.

87
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:04,159
And one important goal is to improve the quality of life, the level of satisfaction and comfort,

88
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,600
that a person or group enjoys. Well, that's all from us today, but remember to join us again

89
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,160
soon for more topical discussion and vocabulary. Bye for now. Bye bye.
