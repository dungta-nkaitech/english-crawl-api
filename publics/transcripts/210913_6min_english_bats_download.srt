Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,760
And I'm Sam.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,640
For centuries, the relationship between humans and bats has been complex.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,760
In some cultures, bats are depicted as vampires,

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,920
associated with Halloween, witches and dark scary places.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,800
In others, they're considered messengers of the gods.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,960
Bats play an important part in stories and myths from around the world.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,200
And a large, illuminated bat signal shining in the night sky

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,240
can mean only one thing, a call for help to the superhero Batman.

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,680
So do we love or hate these furry flying animals?

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,120
And with some newspaper headlines identifying bats as the possible source of COVID-19,

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,600
should we think of them as friend or enemy?

15
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,920
We'll be answering all these questions soon,

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,840
but first, Neil, time for another interesting bat fact.

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:10,159
Did you know that bats account for one in five of all mammal species?

18
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,159
There's a huge variety of them from tiny fruit eating bats

19
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,520
that fit into the palm of your hand to giant carnivals or meat eaters.

20
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,560
That's right. In fact, it's the variety of bat types

21
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,599
that might explain our complex feelings towards them.

22
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,000
So Sam, my quiz question is this,

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
roughly how many different species of bat are they worldwide?

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,479
Is it A, 1.5,000, B, 2.5,000 or C, 3.5,000?

25
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,199
Passing B, 2.5,000.

26
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:43,919
Okay, Sam, we'll come back to that later in the program.

27
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:45,439
Maybe not everyone likes them,

28
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,359
but bats do have some friends.

29
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,079
Farmers love them for pollinating their plants.

30
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,159
And medical scientists study them hoping to discover the secrets

31
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,719
of their anti-aging and long life.

32
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,879
Dr. Winifred Frick is the chief scientist at bat conservation international,

33
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,560
a group of environmentalists working to protect bats.

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,560
Here she is telling BBC World Service program The Documentary

35
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,280
about another useful service provided by bats in the United States.

36
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,919
Most bats are insectivorous in their really important consumers

37
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,840
of different kinds of insect pests.

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,759
And here in the United States, it's been estimated that bats

39
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,319
provide billions of dollars every year to the US agricultural industry

40
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,159
through their voracious consumption of agricultural pests and sex.

41
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,000
Most bats eat only insects, their insectivores.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,239
And that's good news for farmers because they eat many pests,

43
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,959
insects or small animals that are harmful or damaged crops.

44
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,599
Even better, bats appetite for these annoying insects is voracious,

45
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,199
very strong and eager.

46
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,359
So far, so good in the friendship between humans and bats.

47
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:58,159
But then along came the coronavirus pandemic.

48
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,479
And with it, newspaper reports that bats might be to blame.

49
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,759
Before we get into this, we need to explain some terms.

50
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,199
The COVID which people around the world have been suffering from

51
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,439
is the outbreak virus.

52
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,639
But if you go backwards, there's an intermediary known as the progenitor virus.

53
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:22,239
Between this and the ancestral virus, which is decades or centuries older.

54
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,959
99% of scientists would agree that the ancestral virus of COVID-19 came from bats.

55
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,159
But it's the go between progenitor virus that everyone is searching for now.

56
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,839
One of the scientists leading this search is Lin Fa Wang, a professor at Duke Medical School,

57
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:41,839
who is known as the Batman of Singapore.

58
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,879
Here he is explaining his work to BBC World Services, the documentary.

59
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,960
Of course, you know, the Holy Grail right now for COVID-19 is to discover

60
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,920
where is that progenitor virus and also in which kind of animals are human, right?

61
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,800
And usually the progenitor virus has to be 99.9% identical to the outbreak virus.

62
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,599
And so our study was set up but to do that, if you can catch that virus,

63
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,359
and you demonstrate the genomic sequence is 99.9%, then that's brilliant.

64
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:19,600
Professor Wang thinks that finding the source of COVID-19's progenitor virus would be like finding

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,560
the Holy Grail. This expression, the Holy Grail, is associated with the cup believed to have been

66
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,439
used by Jesus Christ at his last meal. It means something extremely difficult to find or get.

67
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,920
If you can discover the progenitor virus, then in the words of Professor Wang, that's brilliant.

68
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,439
An exclamation meaning that's very good or amazing.

69
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:49,839
So although bats are sometimes wrongly blamed for causing COVID, they are good friends to farmers,

70
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:55,519
environmentally, and scientists, as well as vampires. So anyway, what was the answer to your

71
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:02,240
quiz question, Neil? Yes, I asked Sam how many different species of bat there are around the world.

72
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,639
What did you say? I said there were two and a half thousand different species of bat and was I

73
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,639
right? You were close, Sam, but the correct answer was A. There are one and a half thousand different

74
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,079
species of bat around the world. Let's recap the vocabulary from this program about the relationship

75
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:26,960
between humans and bats, starting with carnivores, which are animals that eat meat. Insectivores

76
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:33,680
mean wilder animals, like most bats, that eat only insects. A pest is an insect or small animal

77
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:42,000
that is harmful or damages crops. Bats eat pests voraciously or very eagerly. The holy grail refers

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,839
to something that's extremely difficult to find or get. And finally, you can use the phrase

79
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:54,000
that's brilliant to say that's great or amazing. Once again, our six minutes are up. See you again
