00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:12,080
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish, I'm Sam.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,400
And I'm Neil.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,039
When Helen Russell was three years old, her newborn baby sister died suddenly.

5
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,600
Looking back at that sad time, Helen remembers making a big decision.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,560
She wanted to be happy.

7
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:30,439
She became a best-selling author and wrote a book called The Atlas of Happiness.

8
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:35,600
She got married and even moved to the famously happy city of Copenhagen in Denmark.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,840
But the sadness Helen felt didn't disappear.

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,200
And the longer she lived abroad, the more she wondered whether her feelings were somehow

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,320
connected to being born in England, into a culture where, traditionally, expressing your

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,439
emotions was discouraged.

13
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:57,119
In this programme, we'll be investigating how the way people express sadness is influenced

14
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:58,920
by their culture.

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,079
And as usual, we'll be learning some new useful vocabulary as well.

16
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:05,879
But first, I have a question for you, Neil.

17
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:12,159
In English, there are many idioms which describe being sad, including down in the dumps,

18
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,439
meaning that you feel miserable and depressed.

19
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,799
Also, emotions are often associated with colours.

20
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,920
For example, you might go red with anger or turn green with envy.

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,239
But which colour is associated with sadness?

22
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:32,519
Is it A, yellow, B, blue or C, brown?

23
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,239
I think the answer is blue.

24
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,799
Ok, Neil, we'll find out later in the programme.

25
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,359
Around the world, cultures express emotions very differently.

26
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:47,039
In Spain, flamenco performers express their emotions with colourful displays of song

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,360
and dance, whereas in Japan, crying is considered weak and shameful.

28
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,520
To discover more about how British people express their feelings, Helen Russell interviewed

29
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,120
Thomas Dixon, a professor at the Centre for the History of Emotion for BBC World Service

30
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,120
programme The Documentary

31
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,599
The word sad, as you will know, Helen, literally means satire or full.

32
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,000
So it's earliest uses in English.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,680
It means being literally fed up, being full of something sad or say it means heavy and full.

34
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:25,400
And then of course we have this huge vocabulary of melancholy, sorrow, grief, depression,

35
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,199
and many many other terms and they all mean slightly different things.

36
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:33,920
Professor Dixon explains that the original meaning of the word sad was full or fed up.

37
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,639
A phrase which today means being unhappy, bored or tired of something which has been going

38
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,280
on for a long time.

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,199
For example, everyone is fed up of Covid.

40
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:50,000
But fed up is just one of many words to describe feelings of sadness, each with a slightly

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,719
different meaning.

42
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:57,280
One of them is melancholy, a kind of intense and thoughtful sadness.

43
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,800
Another is grief, a strong sadness often caused by the death of someone you love.

44
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,840
In Irish culture, melancholy is expressed artistically in poems or songs and in other cultures,

45
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,280
India, for example, grief can be expressed by professional mourners who are paid to cry

46
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,039
by the family of the person who has died.

47
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,120
In England, however, big public displays of emotion are uncommon.

48
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,199
But according to Professor Dixon, that wasn't always the case.

49
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:31,039
Here he explains to BBC World Service programme the documentary, how it was only quite recently

50
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:36,520
during the time of Queen Victoria and the British Empire, that the English got a reputation

51
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,439
for being repressed and able to show their true feelings and emotions.

52
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:46,840
By and large, it's a Victorian and then it's an audience and 20th century characterisation.

53
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,600
As you can imagine, you know it fits with the era of empire, of white British men going

54
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:59,360
around the world, conquering it and having a stiff upper lip and ruling over the people

55
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,560
in other parts of the world and believing themselves, the white Europeans to be superior,

56
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,879
one sign of that superiority in Darwin writes,

57
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,599
English men rarely cry except under the pressure of the acuteest grief.

58
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:18,720
Professor Dixon says that the Victorians who ran the British Empire had a stiff upper lip.

59
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,360
These men believed they were better than everyone else and that to cry was a sign of weakness.

60
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:31,439
When we cry, our top lip starts to wobble and so this gave rise to the idiom a stiff upper lip,

61
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,800
meaning to not show your feelings when you're upset even though it's difficult not to.

62
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,240
Fortunately, most Brits are less repressed nowadays, but it's still hard for some people,

63
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,319
especially men, to express their feelings.

64
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:49,839
Sometimes drinking alcohol gives people the courage to say what they're feeling,

65
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,000
but this is not so healthy and can even increase feelings of depression.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,199
It's talking to someone about your feelings that can really help and keep away the blues

67
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,120
and in saying that, I think I've answered your question, Sam.

68
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,360
I asked Neil which colour is often associated with feeling sad?

69
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,279
And I said it was blue.

70
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,599
Which was, of course, the correct answer.

71
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:15,680
And it gives us another idiom about sadness, feeling blue.

72
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,360
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this programme

73
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,399
about the emotion of sadness, or in other words, feeling down in the dumps.

74
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,879
If you are fed up of something, you're unhappy, bored or tired of it,

75
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,679
especially if it's been happening a long time.

76
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:35,599
Melancholy is a type of intense and thoughtful sadness,

77
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:40,000
while grief is a strong sadness usually caused by someone's death.

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,439
The adjective repressed means unable to show your true feelings and emotions.

79
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,560
And finally, the uniquely British idiom to keep a stiff upper lip

80
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,439
means not to show your feelings when you're upset.

81
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,759
Even though it is difficult not to.

82
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,879
Hiding your feelings definitely won't make you happy,

83
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,000
but making friends and learning something new might.

84
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,160
So remember to join us again soon here at 6 Minute English.

85
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,800
Bye for now.

86
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,279
Goodbye.
