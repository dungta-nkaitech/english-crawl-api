00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,879
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:18,080
And I'm Sam.

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,080
Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,879
Do you know where these famous words are from, Sam?

8
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:31,199
I think that's a speech by Mark Antony in William Shakespeare's play, Julius Caesar.

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,439
Wow, I'm impressed. Caesar has been assassinated and Mark Antony tries to persuade the crowd to

10
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,039
find his killers.

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:45,039
Using words to persuade people, giving them a good reason to do what you say or to accept your

12
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:51,679
argument is known as rhetoric. In this programme, we'll be hearing all about rhetoric,

13
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,039
and of course, learning some related vocabulary as well.

14
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,200
The art of rhetoric started with the ancient Greek philosophers.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,640
Later, during the Roman Republic, politicians and statesmen used rhetoric in speeches

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,120
given to crowds in the public square.

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,519
Although technology has transformed the way we communicate since then,

18
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,799
the art of rhetoric is still alive today. Modern politicians may prefer

19
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:23,679
Twitter to the public square, but they still use persuasive language, including soundbites,

20
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:28,879
short sentences or phrases, giving a message in an easy to remember way.

21
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,640
We'll hear more soon, but first I have a question for you, Sam.

22
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,879
Roman politicians used many rhetorical tricks to persuade people,

23
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:43,840
including the Argumentum ad hominum, which was an attack on their opponent's moral character.

24
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,280
Another was called the Argumentum ad baculum.

25
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:55,520
But what did it mean? Was it A, an argument based on logic, B, an argument based on emotion,

26
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,960
or C, an argument based on the stick?

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,120
Well, to persuade someone, your argument needs to be logical, so I'll say A.

28
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,560
Okay, we'll find out the answer later. Whether you want someone to vote for you or to buy

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,280
what you're selling, rhetoric can make your message persuasive.

30
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,719
During his career in the advertising industry, Sam Tatum learned a lot about persuading people.

31
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,120
Here he explains the many uses of rhetoric to BBC World Service Program, the Y Factor.

32
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:35,199
Rhetoric is persuasive language. We use it to rally, to simplify the complex, to inspire an

33
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,520
influence, but it's important, I think, to identify what strategies might be influencing us more

34
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,680
than we think. By understanding the power of language and shaping perceptions,

35
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,120
we can start to say, I'm wondering why people are looking to be so concrete.

36
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,040
Are we trying to pull the all over our eyes of something that's far more complex than we actually

37
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:58,080
state? As well as persuading people, Sam Tatum says rhetoric can be used to rally,

38
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,560
to bring people together in support of a common goal. A recent example of this is the way politicians

39
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,719
called the coronavirus, our enemy. The words politicians choose and the way they use them can

40
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:16,560
influence us more than we think. Sam Tatum says we should question whether political rhetoric is

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,480
trying to pull the wool over our eyes, an informal way of saying trick or deceive us.

42
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:29,599
But in the age of 24 hour news updates and non-stocked Twitter has the skill of making a thoughtful

43
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,960
argument been lost. Here's Kendall Phillips, professor of political philosophy at Syracuse University,

44
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:44,240
speaking to BBC World Services, the why factor. It's also hard to analyze the argument or reasoning

45
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,799
of a tweet, because 280 characters is not a way for me to lay out a logical argument with a major

46
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:55,280
premise of minor premise and a conclusion. It's much easier to just use a two word phrase or hashtag

47
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,800
that usually ends up adding to that kind of polemical division between my side and their side.

48
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:08,639
Global problems involve complex issues which cannot be solved in 280 letters, the maximum length

49
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:14,960
of a tweet allowed by Twitter. According to Professor Kendall, we need logical arguments containing

50
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:21,600
a premise, something which you think is true, and you use as the basis for developing your idea

51
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,320
and a conclusion, your decision or plan of action based on carefully considering all the relevant facts.

52
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,080
For example, climate change is damaging the planet, that's a premise.

53
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,640
Therefore, we should act to stop it, that's a conclusion.

54
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,800
Few issues are simply black and white though, and this is a problem because Twitter debates are

55
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,600
often polemical, argued very strongly either for or against a particular opinion or idea.

56
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,680
If you believe passionately in something, you need to explain it to people in a way they understand,

57
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,639
and in ancient times rhetoric also meant building bridges between people and finding common ground.

58
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,120
Like those Romans you mentioned Neil. Yes, in my question I ask Sam for the meaning of the term

59
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,879
Argumentum Add Baculum. I guess it was an argument based on logic.

60
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:23,199
Which was the wrong answer I'm afraid. In fact, argumentum add baculum means

61
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,879
the argument with a stick, or in other words, hitting somebody with a stick until they agree with you.

62
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:34,720
I guess that's one way to win an argument. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from the program,

63
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,000
starting with soundbite, a short sentence or phrase designed to stick in the memory.

64
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,639
When people rally together they unite to support a common goal.

65
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,160
To pull the wall over someone's eyes means to trick someone.

66
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,560
Logical arguments contain a premise, a truth used as the basis for developing an argument,

67
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,319
and a conclusion, a decision based on carefully considering all the relevant facts.

68
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,759
And finally, polemical means strongly attacking or defending an opinion or idea.

69
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,519
But there's no arguing the fact that once again our six minutes are up.

70
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,719
Goodbye for now. Bye.
