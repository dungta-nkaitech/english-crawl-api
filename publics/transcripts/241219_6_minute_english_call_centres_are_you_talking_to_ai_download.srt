00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Phil.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,100
And I'm Pippa. Have you ever phoned up a company and had your call held in a queue?

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,000
If you have, then you've probably heard messages like this.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,600
Hello, your call is important to us. You are number 89 in the queue.

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,600
If you'd like to continue to hold press 1, if you'd like to return to the main menu press 0,

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,600
how do you feel when your phone call is put on hold, Phil?

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,600
Ah, frustrated usually.

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,600
Although I do like it when there's a number saying how many people are in front of you.

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,600
Well, when your call is finally connected, it's usually a call centre worker you'll speak to,

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,600
a real live person who'll hopefully fix your problem.

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,600
But increasingly, this work is now done using artificial intelligence or AI.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,599
And this is causing problems in countries like India and the Philippines,

14
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,599
where call centre jobs make up a big part of the economy.

15
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:15,599
In this programme, we'll be asking who's really in charge at the call centre? Humans or AI?

16
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,599
As always, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary.

17
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:24,599
And remember, you can read along with the programme and find the list of new words and phrases

18
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:29,599
by visiting our website, bbclearningenglish.com.

19
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,599
But now, I have a question for you, Phil.

20
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:37,599
Around the world, numbers of call centre workers have grown rapidly in recent years.

21
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,599
If you're listening to this, maybe you're a call centre worker yourself.

22
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:47,599
So, approximately how many people work in call centres globally, Phil?

23
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:53,599
Is it a 7 million, b 17 million or c 27 million?

24
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,599
I think b 17 million.

25
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,599
Okay, well, you'll have to listen to the end to find out the answer.

26
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:09,599
Now, one worker worried about the impact of AI on jobs in the Philippines is Miley and Gabelona,

27
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,599
president of the call centre workers union, B-I-E-N.

28
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,599
Here, she tells BBC World Service programme TechLife about some of the difficulties of her job

29
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,599
and why she fears for the future.

30
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:30,599
So, and this person is quite already aggravated and he keeps on yelling and that's the difficult part

31
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:37,599
because the mental stress also, you have to pacify the client and you have to make sure

32
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,599
you're able to resolve the concern.

33
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:47,599
And then the difficult part on that conversation is that you're being monitored by an AI.

34
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,599
I mean, eventually AI would replace us.

35
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,599
It's going to displace workers in, you know, eventually in the near future.

36
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:04,599
Even as a matter of fact, there's been a study that says that about 300,000 workers

37
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:11,599
or around 27% of workers that's going to be displaced because of AI.

38
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,599
And it's slowly happening.

39
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:16,599
Call centre work involves dealing with customers who've phoned up to complain.

40
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:21,599
They're often angry, aggravated and yelling or shouting down the phone.

41
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,599
It's Miley's job to pacify them, to calm them down.

42
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,599
If that wasn't stressful enough, Miley's conversations are monitored by AI systems

43
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,599
to see how well she fixes her clients problems.

44
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,599
You might think AI was built to support workers like Miley,

45
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,599
but she fears AI will replace her in the near future,

46
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,599
a phrase meaning very soon or within a short time.

47
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:52,599
Miley emphasizes her fears about being replaced by giving details about the study she read

48
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:57,599
which claim that 27% of workers will be displaced by AI.

49
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,599
She uses the phrase as a matter of fact to emphasise what she's saying

50
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:05,599
and to give more detail as evidence to support it.

51
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,599
But Miley thinks AI will never fully replace humans.

52
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,599
She says AI lacks one important quality, empathy.

53
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,600
Here she explains more to BBC World Services tech life.

54
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Well, I don't think AI could be, you know, empathetic or whenever they talk.

55
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,600
I mean, if ever a machine or a robot talks to them, you know,

56
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,600
people learn more compassionate than, you know, when you talk to a robot.

57
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,600
Miley says that AI is not empathetic.

58
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,600
Unlike humans, it can't put itself in someone else's place

59
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,600
and share their feelings or experiences.

60
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,600
If you listen carefully to Miley's speech, you'll notice she says you know a lot.

61
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Frazes like you know, um, and are are called filler words

62
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,600
and are used to give the speaker time to think or to express uncertainty.

63
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
Right, I think it's time I revealed the answer to my question, Phil.

64
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,600
I asked you how many call centre workers are there globally?

65
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
And I said 17 million.

66
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,600
Which is the right answer.

67
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,600
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme,

68
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,600
starting with yelling another word for shouting.

69
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,600
To pacify someone means to calm them down when they're angry.

70
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,600
In the near future means very soon or within a short time.

71
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,600
The phrase as a matter of fact is used to add emphasis to what you're saying,

72
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,600
to give more detail about what you've just said

73
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
or to introduce something that contrasts with it.

74
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,600
If you're empathetic, you're able to put yourself in someone else's position

75
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,600
and share their feelings or experiences.

76
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,600
And finally, filler words like, um, are, and you know,

77
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,600
give the speaker more time to think or to express uncertainty.

78
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Once again, our six minutes are up.

79
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Bye.

80
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Bye.
