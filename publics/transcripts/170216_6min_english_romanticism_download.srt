00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,120
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English,

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,040
the show that brings you an interesting topic,

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,280
authentic listening practice and vocabulary

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,960
to help you improve your language skills.

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,800
I'm Dan and I'm Neil.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,359
In this program, we'll be discussing romance,

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,440
as well as teaching you six new items of vocabulary, of course.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,640
Now, Dan, why are you looking so upset?

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,160
Oh, Neil, it's all over.

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,320
She broke up with me on Valentine's Day.

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,320
She said I wasn't the one.

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,679
Cheer up, Dan.

17
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:39,920
Cheer up. It's not your fault.

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,640
No.

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,880
You can blame romanticism.

20
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,680
Romanticism?

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,439
Well, what's that?

22
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,520
Romanticism was a movement that started in Europe and spread worldwide.

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,400
It influenced literature, art, poetry, music,

24
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,079
and the way people behaved.

25
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,560
A movement, meaning a group of people working together

26
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,679
to support an idea.

27
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,560
Yes, and that brings us on to this week's question.

28
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,000
When was the start of the romantic period?

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,960
Was it A, the beginning of the 18th century?

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,359
B, the middle of the 18th century,

31
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,920
or C, the end of the 18th century.

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,520
Well, I honestly have no idea,

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,359
so I'm going to go smack in the middle,

34
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,359
the middle of the 18th century.

35
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,120
And we'll find out later on in the show

36
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,800
if you got the question right.

37
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,439
Now, going back to your ex-girlfriend,

38
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,439
let me take a wild guess.

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,879
Love at first sight, was it?

40
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:27,840
Well, yes.

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,640
What's your point?

42
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,560
Well, it's not your fault, Dan.

43
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,120
The idea is romantic, and by that,

44
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,159
I mean it originated from the romantic era.

45
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,159
It was part of the zeitgeist,

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,959
and many of these ideas still continue today.

47
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:41,840
zeitgeist.

48
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,200
The word comes from German,

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,840
and literally means the spirit of the time.

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,319
A lot of what we believe about love today,

51
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,400
for example, the idea that two people will live happily ever after,

52
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,719
comes from the romantic period.

53
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:56,400
But everyone loves a bit of romance.

54
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,359
Well, that's true.

55
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:59,920
However, it's one thing to enjoy romance,

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,799
but it can be dangerous to judge your relationship

57
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,560
against romantic ideals.

58
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,439
True.

59
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,359
It might not be a realistic benchmark,

60
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:08,879
and by that, I mean a standard

61
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,479
from which other things are judged.

62
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,960
So we grow up hearing these romantic stories,

63
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,879
which leads us to develop an idea

64
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,879
of what a relationship is meant to be,

65
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,439
and then we get disappointed by the real thing.

66
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,599
Well, to put it bluntly, yes.

67
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,599
The romantic ideal is just that.

68
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,439
An idealized version, or perfect version, of a relationship.

69
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,759
But it often leaves out the nitty-gritty,

70
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,519
meaning practical details.

71
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,000
Details like work, stress, children,

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,120
all of the things that we have to deal with in everyday life.

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,439
Not to mention the fact that everyone is flawed

74
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,359
or imperfect in their own way.

75
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:43,840
That means we get angry or moody or upset

76
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
for all sorts of reasons.

77
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,159
Exactly.

78
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:49,039
Many popular love stories end at the point

79
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,599
where the characters get together or marry.

80
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,359
But very few show us how to keep that someone special

81
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:57,359
over a long period of time.

82
00:02:57,359 --> 00:02:59,039
A relationship is hard work.

83
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,919
And if the relationship you are in isn't as perfect

84
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,599
as the story said it should be,

85
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,599
then maybe you're with the wrong person,

86
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,359
which could explain why so many marriages end in divorce.

87
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:12,000
I wonder if that's true for other people's relationships.

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,799
Fortunately, I found some people with partners and asked them,

89
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:17,599
is your partner 100% perfect for you?

90
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,639
No.

91
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,439
No.

92
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,639
Hmm, not 100%.

93
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,479
No, I don't think that's true.

94
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,479
Does that mean true love doesn't exist?

95
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,959
No, it just means that all relationships

96
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,399
must be worked on and that perfection is impossible.

97
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:34,879
But we should never give up trying.

98
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,959
You're right. She wasn't the one for me.

99
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,719
I need to find my next Juliet.

100
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,159
She'll be just perfect.

101
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,759
Oh, Dan, you haven't learned anything.

102
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,519
You're just a hopeless romantic.

103
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,759
Now, can you remember the quiz question?

104
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,599
I asked you when the romantic period originated.

105
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,479
Was it A, the beginning of the 18th century,

106
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:54,399
B, the middle of the 18th century,

107
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:56,399
or C, the end of the 18th century?

108
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:58,239
And I said the middle of the 18th century.

109
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,120
Wrong, I'm afraid it was towards the end of the 18th century.

110
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,439
I have not been good in my life at the moment.

111
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,840
Shall we take a look at the vocabulary, too?

112
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,879
Sure. The first word we had was movement.

113
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,399
A movement is a group of people working together to support an idea.

114
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,560
Can you think of any modern day movements, Neil?

115
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,160
The environmental movement is very strong and popular at the moment,

116
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,079
as is the movement for equality, gender equality, for example.

117
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,639
And the next word we had was zeitgeist.

118
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,079
Now, a zeitgeist literally means the spirit of a particular time.

119
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,879
What would you say the zeitgeist is these days, Dad?

120
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,600
Well, I think there's a focus on personal freedom.

121
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,519
There's environmental concern.

122
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,480
And of course, let's not forget the rise of social media.

123
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,319
The next word we had was benchmark.

124
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,599
A benchmark is a standard from which other things are judged.

125
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:48,800
If you were looking for a new house, Neil, what would your benchmark be?

126
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,000
Well, my current house has a garden and it has somewhere I can park my car.

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,480
So that would be the benchmark for a new house.

128
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,959
It would have to have that at least end more.

129
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,240
Next we have idealized.

130
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,000
An idealized thing is an often imagined perfect version of something.

131
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,159
Now, what three things would exist in an idealized world for you, then, Dad?

132
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:11,759
I would say personal freedom, religious tolerance,

133
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,639
and free ice cream for everybody on a daily basis.

134
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,279
Brilliant.

135
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:16,159
OK.

136
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,759
Next we have nitty gritty.

137
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,959
The nitty gritty is the important or practical detail involved in a situation or thing.

138
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,279
Now, getting married is supposed to be a wonderful thing,

139
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,240
but what about the nitty gritty of the ceremony, Neil?

140
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,599
Give us a few examples.

141
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:33,920
Well, you have to decide who's going to sit next to who, who to invite.

142
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,959
The food.

143
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,079
Some people don't like this.

144
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,279
Some people don't like that.

145
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,360
You've got to get the flowers right.

146
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,959
Oh, there's so much to think about.

147
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,959
Make sure you think that marriage might be flawed.

148
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,399
And flawed is a thing which is imperfect in some way.

149
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:49,759
London is a great city, but how do you feel about it, Dad?

150
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,599
Well, I think it's flawed in the way that the public transport could use an upgrade.

151
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:55,680
There's never enough space on the carriages.

152
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,759
