Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:23,280
And I'm Neil. Recently, I met up with an old school friend. I hadn't seen for years. We talked

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:29,199
for hours. All right, sounds like you had a good chinwag, a long and pleasant conversation between

5
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:35,280
friends, which is great because in this programme, we're talking about talking. We'll be discussing

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,280
conversations, the exchange of ideas, thoughts and feelings that happens when people talk to each

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,560
other. And as usual, we'll be learning some new vocabulary as well. With the rise of Twitter

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,920
and social media, which encourages us to give our opinion on a subject without always listening

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,120
in return, some think the ass of conversation is being lost. But luckily, there are still millions

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:07,359
of us who love to talk. Chat, chinwag and chatter away. In fact, in 2012, a competition in Latvia

11
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:13,840
broke the world record for the longest telephone conversation. So, Neil, my question is this.

12
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:21,280
How long did this record-breaking conversation last? Was it? A, 24 hours and four minutes.

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,079
B, 54 hours and four minutes. Or C, 84 hours and four minutes.

14
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,719
I'll guess A, 24 hours and four minutes, after which they probably fell asleep.

15
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,560
Okay, Neil, I'll reveal the correct answer later in the programme.

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,799
During a long career, DJ and BBC Radio presenter, Nehal Atherneiker, has had conversations with

17
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,960
hundreds of people. Now, he's used these experiences to write a book entitled Let's Talk.

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,960
How to have better conversations. Here, Nehal tells another radio presenter, Michael Rosen,

19
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,760
of BBC Radio 4's Word of Mouth, about the influence of his mother, who also love talking to people

20
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:12,080
in her job as a nurse. Well, it gave me the sense that you are enriched by listening. And this was

21
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:19,120
of course pre-social media, which is of course encouraged us to project to transmit more than receive.

22
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,920
So it meant that I guess I was conscious of the experiences of others and wanted to try and

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,400
understand them. Also partially, Michael, it was a survival instinct because I was a little brown

24
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,120
boy in a predominantly white school, a state school in the 1980s. For Nehal, good conversation

25
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,480
involves listening as much as speaking. By listening, we find out things about the person we're

26
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:52,079
talking to, which in turn help us understand ourselves. This is why Nehal says we are enriched

27
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:58,479
by listening. We're improved by having something else added. As a British Asian boy growing up

28
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:04,799
in a white community, Nehal also thinks conversation was a way for him to make friends and find

29
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:11,439
protection. He says having conversations was a survival instinct. The human instinct to do

30
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,919
something in a dangerous situation that will keep them safe from harm.

31
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:22,560
Nehal sees an important difference between listening simply to reply and listening to understand.

32
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,759
When we listen to reply, we're thinking about the next thing we want to say, more than trying

33
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,960
to understand the other person's point of view. Listening to understand, on the other hand,

34
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:39,520
helps build bridges. Improve relationships between people who are very different or do not like

35
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,640
each other. Here's Nehal again in conversation with BBC Radio Falls, word of mouth.

36
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,920
So, conversation can build bridges and it is proven through history that conversation has

37
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,400
and that conversation can be seen as an art form. And that's one of the things I want us to

38
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,200
understand. It's not just tittle tattle. It's not just shouting at each other on social media.

39
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,360
It's not two politicians talking over each other. Good conversation brings people together.

40
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,960
Unlike tittle tattle. Talk about other people's lives that is usually unkind,

41
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:22,080
disapproving or untrue. And good conversation involves taking turns, not talking over someone,

42
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:28,080
trying to silence people by talking more loudly, forcefully and persistently than them.

43
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,240
Hopefully, Nehal's tips can help us all have better conversations, encounter new ideas and make

44
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,280
friends. So Sam, did you do any of these things when you met up with your old school friend?

45
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,519
I think so. We both listened to each other. There was no tittle tattle, but a little bit of gossip.

46
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:51,439
Before we knew it, a couple of hours had passed. But not as much time as those record-breaking

47
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:57,519
telephone conversations I mentioned earlier. Ah yes, in your question, you asked how long the world's

48
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:03,840
longest telephone conversation lasted. I guessed it was an incredible 24 hours and four minutes.

49
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:10,159
Was I right? Well, Nehal, I'm afraid that was the wrong answer. In fact, the record-breaking

50
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:19,519
conversation lasted 54 hours and four minutes. About the same as 540 programmes of six minutes English.

51
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:25,439
Wow. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this programme on the art of good

52
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:30,959
conversations, starting with Chinwag, a long and pleasant conversation between friends.

53
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,079
When something is enriched, it's improved by having something else added to it.

54
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:42,000
The survival instinct is the basic instinct in humans and animals to do something in a dangerous

55
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
situation that will keep them alive. If you build bridges, you improve relationships between people

56
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,439
who are very different or do not like each other. Tittle tattle is talk about other people's lives

57
00:05:53,439 --> 00:06:00,319
that is usually unkind, disapproving or untrue. And finally, if you talk over someone, you silence

58
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,360
or drown them out by talking more loudly than them. That's the end of our conversation,

59
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,560
but remember to join us soon for more trending topics and useful vocabulary. Bye for now.
