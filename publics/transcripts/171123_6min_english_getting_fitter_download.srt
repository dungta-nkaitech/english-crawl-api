From BBC Learning English

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,160
Hello, I'm Rob. Welcome to 6 Minute English,

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,199
where we get together to discuss an interesting topic

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,719
along with six useful items of vocabulary to wrestle with.

8
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,600
Yes, hello, I'm Catherine, and today's topic is all about togetherness,

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,640
because we're talking about going to the gym,

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,399
and why gym membership is becoming increasingly popular there.

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,240
So, Rob, do you head off to your local gym after work?

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,960
No, I hate group exercise.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,439
I prefer to go for a run on my own.

14
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,000
It's free, and I enjoy being outdoors.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,359
How about you, Catherine?

16
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,000
Well, I really like group exercise, Rob.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,079
I find it really motivating.

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,680
And when something is motivating, it makes us want to do something.

19
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,240
So, what motivates you to go to the gym, Catherine?

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,359
Well, I go because I really like the spin classes.

21
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,000
Ah, is that where you cycle on the spot while an instructor shouts at you?

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,920
Well, yes, that's the one.

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,079
And if it wasn't in that class, I don't think I'd push myself so hard.

24
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:17,200
I need someone to shout at me, to make me go faster and get up those hills.

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,439
Good, and if you push yourself, you force yourself to try harder.

26
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,439
You set yourself a challenge.

27
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,959
Okay, Catherine, well, you are part of a growing trend of people

28
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,000
who like to work out or exercise in a gym.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,200
So, perhaps you can tell me how many people are members of a gym here in the UK?

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,640
Is it A, 1 in 2, B, 1 in 7, or C, 1 in 10?

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,640
Hmm, I'm going to go for 1 in 10.

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,560
Well, we'll find out if you chose the right answer later on.

33
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,560
Now, let's listen to Philip Mills.

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,120
He runs the sports fitness company Les Mills, named after his father,

35
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,600
who was a track and field athlete who represented New Zealand for 20 years.

36
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,760
Philip has a theory to explain why group exercise has become so popular in recent years.

37
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,120
As people have become more sedentary, they've realised that they need to move for their health.

38
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,280
We work about 35% more hours than we used to work in the 60s,

39
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,840
and people are too busy to play sports.

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,319
Society has become fragmented, and a lot of the things that used to bring people together

41
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,840
don't exist anymore.

42
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,639
But, you know, we're tribal animals, we pack animals,

43
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,080
and the gym has been one of the things that helps people to commune.

44
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,080
Yes, our sedentary lifestyles.

45
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,360
We do all spend too much time sitting down, don't we, Rob?

46
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,520
Yes, and according to Philip, we're probably spending more time sitting down

47
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,320
than we used to, because we're working a lot more.

48
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,439
Exactly, and because we're busier with work, we have less time to take exercise.

49
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,160
So, why are we choosing to go to the gym these days,

50
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,960
rather than heading down to the park to play football?

51
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,360
Philip Mills thinks it's because society has become fragmented,

52
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,719
and we're losing the social connectedness that made it easy to get together and take exercise.

53
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,680
And fragmented means broken up into small pieces, by the way.

54
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,920
The thing is, we miss that social connectedness,

55
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,200
that feeling of belonging to a group, because we are essentially tribal animals.

56
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,760
And a tribe is a group of people who live together and they share the same language

57
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,360
and the same culture.

58
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,879
So, even now most of us have left tribal society behind,

59
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,800
we still want to feel like we're part of a group that we can commune with,

60
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,280
which means to get close to someone or something.

61
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:48,960
But the question is Rob, does group exercise at the gym actually succeed in connecting us with other people?

62
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,800
Well, Philip Mills thinks in the future we'll be cycling inside a video game using computer graphics,

63
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,920
you know, visiting other planets, traveling to different times.

64
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,360
Wow, but people will then be communing with a computer, Rob, not really with each other.

65
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah, I'm afraid so, and you won't even have a real instructor barking instructions at you.

66
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,000
Well, I suppose a computer will have a virtual instructor who will also be equally motivating.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,879
Hmm, it's like so. Now, remember I asked you, Catherine, how many people are members of a gym here in the UK?

68
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:25,680
I do remember you asking me that. Rob, and I said one in ten.

69
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,240
And you were wrong, I'm afraid.

70
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,319
Figures collected by leisure database, a company that has audited the fitness industry for 15 years,

71
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:39,920
show that one in seven of the UK population is a member of a gym, and more and more will be

72
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,719
signing up. Total membership could soon exceed 10 million for the first time.

73
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:45,519
Wow.

74
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,040
Okay, now let's talk through the vocabulary items we heard today.

75
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,759
Number one is motivating, meaning something that makes us want to do something.

76
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,360
I don't find the idea of cycling in a small room very motivating.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,680
Now, number two, if you push yourself, you force yourself to try harder.

78
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,800
So it's important to push yourself if you want to do well in your exams.

79
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,480
Good advice there, Catherine.

80
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,920
Next up is workout, which means to exercise in order to improve your health and fitness.

81
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,720
For example, Catherine works out three times a week by cycling on the spot.

82
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,960
Our fourth word is fragmented or broken up into small pieces.

83
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,160
For example, I suffer from fragmented sleep.

84
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,319
I wake up five or six times a night.

85
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,279
Oh, poor you.

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,120
All right, number four is tribal, and the noun is tribe, a group of people who live together

87
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,759
and share the same language and culture.

88
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,600
Football fans often wear the tribal colours of a teammate's support.

89
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,120
Some paint their faces too.

90
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,120
And finally, we heard commune, which means to get close to someone or something.

91
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,000
For example, Rob likes to commune with nature when he goes running.

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,680
He enjoys the way the landscape changes with the seasons.

93
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,959
Well said, Catherine.

94
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:03,600
Thank you.

95
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,160
Now that's all we have time for today, but if you would like to commune with us via our Facebook,

96
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,399
Twitter or YouTube pages, please do so.

97
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,600
Bye bye.
