00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,440
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,480
And I'm Sam.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,879
In this programme, we'll be discussing our closest neighbour in the solar system,

7
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,400
the planet Mars.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,719
Often called the red planet.

9
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:31,839
Mars has been in the news a lot recently with three separate missions being sent

10
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,600
to explore the planet's surface in 2021.

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,719
Our fascination with the red planet has given birth to some interesting art over the years.

12
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,679
This includes music, such as David Bowie's 1973 hit, Life on Mars,

13
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:52,719
and countless films from 1938's Mars Attacks to the 2015 blockbuster The Martian.

14
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,079
But human interest in Mars goes back much earlier.

15
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,439
Ancient civilizations like the Maya of Central America observed the planet's colour

16
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,359
and recorded its movements just like modern astronomers,

17
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,159
scientists who study the universe and the stars, planets and suns within it.

18
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,920
Yet, despite this, many questions remain unanswered.

19
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,359
What caused the marks and scars on the planet's surface?

20
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,200
And the biggest question of all is their life on Mars.

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,039
But before we go on, I have another question which needs answering Sam.

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,640
The ancient Romans were also interested in Mars.

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,520
They even considered the planet to be a god.

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,960
But god of what?

25
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,960
Was Mars the Roman god of A, love, B, fire or sea war?

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:46,160
Well, Mars is the red planet, so I guess the answer is B, the Roman god of fire?

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,640
Okay Sam, we'll find out the answer at the end of the programme.

28
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,400
Whatever the Romans thought, civilizations throughout history have described

29
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,400
looking into the night sky and seeing a bright red light.

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,319
But where does Mars' characteristic colour come from?

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,479
Someone who can answer that is Dr. Michael Maya.

32
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,159
As lead scientist on NASA's Mars exploration programme,

33
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,840
he spent years observing and recording the red planet.

34
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,439
Listen to Dr. Maya in conversation with BBC World Service programme The Forum.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,560
Try to hear the explanation he gives for Mars's unusual colour.

36
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,120
One of the distinctive things about Mars is that it's red, so you can see it and identify it.

37
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,400
It looks red because of rust.

38
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,879
Iron oxide on the surface, which is red.

39
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,199
And interestingly, that look can change.

40
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,199
And we saw that in 2018 when there was a global dust storm.

41
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:51,679
Mars, instead of looking red, looked a little orange.

42
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:56,239
And it's that, you know, that changing of colour might have made

43
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:04,639
the civilizations watching Mars maybe uneasy to see something immutable in our night sky,

44
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:06,479
changing colours.

45
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,840
Dr. Maya calls Mars' red colour distinctive.

46
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,519
Easy to recognise because it's different from everything else.

47
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,719
But did you hear why it's red in the first place, Sam?

48
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:26,159
Yes, it's red because of rust, a reddish chemical substance called iron oxide

49
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,839
that occurs when metals react with water and air.

50
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,719
The colour of this rust can change slightly from red to brown to orange.

51
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:40,080
And Dr. Maya thinks these changing colours may have worried ancient astronomers who believed Mars

52
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,800
was immutable or never changing.

53
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:49,520
Unlike ancient civilizations, modern astronomers have sent satellites to land on Mars and explore its

54
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:57,840
surface. And although no human has set foot on the red planet so far, we know a lot about conditions there.

55
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,960
So in the words of David Bowie, is there life on Mars?

56
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,240
Well, that all depends on finding water.

57
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:12,480
Water is life. And as Dr. Maya told BBC World Services The Forum, with water, anything is possible.

58
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,840
And from all that we have learned from astrobiology, life is amazingly adaptable.

59
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,160
But it still needs water. So that's why water is the key.

60
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,920
So finding liquid water on Mars whether or not it's now or whether or not it's in the past,

61
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:37,199
tells you that you potentially have a habitable environment, some place that could support life

62
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,959
and perhaps even Martian life.

63
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:46,560
Dr. Maya says that life is amazingly adaptable, able to change in order to survive in new

64
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:53,439
situations. Finding liquid water could make the red planet habitable, good enough to live on.

65
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:59,599
And with billionaire businessmen like Elon Musk, planning manned missions to space,

66
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,200
who knows how long it could be before we see a human on Mars.

67
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,800
And who knows what they'd find there? Tiny worms, little green men, or maybe a Roman god?

68
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:16,960
Ah, yes. In your question you asked what Mars was the Roman god of? And I guess B, the Roman god of

69
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:24,480
fire. Which was the wrong answer I'm afraid. In fact, the Romans considered Mars their god of war

70
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,480
and sacrificed wild animals to him, such as wolves, bears and strangely woodpeckers.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,360
Okay, Neil, let's recap the vocabulary from this program on the red planet, Mars,

72
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,680
starting with astronomer, someone who studies the stars, planets and moons in our universe.

73
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,879
If something is distinctive, it's easily recognizable because it's different from everything else.

74
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:57,279
Rust or iron oxide is a red coloured chemical that occurs when metals react with water and air.

75
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:03,360
Immutable means never changing. Something which is adaptable can easily change to deal with new

76
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,759
circumstances. And finally, habitable means good enough to live in. That's all we have time for.

77
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,879
Bye for now. Goodbye.
