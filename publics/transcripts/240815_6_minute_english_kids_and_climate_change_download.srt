Hello, this is 6-Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil

4
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:13,120
And I'm Beth

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:20,719
Many of those leading the fight against climate change are young people who feel betrayed by politicians and adults.

6
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:25,760
In survey after survey, children report feeling that they have no future,

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,760
that humanity is doomed and that governments are failing to act.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,640
This is causing many young people to feel worried about the state of the planet.

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,960
There's even a name for it, climate anxiety, and it's also creating conflict between adults

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,600
and children in families and schools.

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,719
What's certain is that a solution to the climate emergency needs the cooperation of everyone,

12
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,880
both old and young. So can talking honestly about the climate help mend the divisions

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,960
between generations. That's what we'll be discussing in this programme,

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,200
along with some useful new vocabulary.

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:07,040
But first I have a question for you, Neil. Many young people's hopes and fears about

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,040
climate change are symbolised by the Swedish activist Greta Tumberg. These days, Greta

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,760
travels the world speaking about the climate emergency, but her protests started much smaller

18
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,600
in her hometown Stockholm. So how did Greta Tumberg's climate activism begin?

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,240
Did she, A, plant trees in her school garden,

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,480
B skip school on Fridays, or C recycle her school's plastic waste?

21
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,160
I think Greta Tumberg went on strike and skipped school on Fridays.

22
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,840
Okay, Neil. I will reveal the correct answer later in the programme.

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,520
One recent survey showed that three quarters or more of young people in the UK

24
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:59,680
feel the future is frightening. Here, Mee aged 14 and Milly 11 share some of their fears with

25
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,719
BBC ideas. If climate change were like an animal or a plant, I think it'd be some sort of parasite

26
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,439
because it's the only thing that's actually growing and getting bigger while everything else

27
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:20,400
starts dying off. I think climate change is like really scary and the fact that lots of people

28
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,079
aren't doing much about it just sort of freaks me out. The environment is definitely very special

29
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:31,759
because if we get rid of it, there's nowhere else we can go. Like it's a very one-in-a-million

30
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:38,879
sort of planet. Mee calls climate change a parasite. In the natural world, a parasite is an animal

31
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,560
or plant that lives on another living thing and feeds from it. If you describe a person as a

32
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,240
parasite, you mean they are lazy and live off other people supporting them or giving them money.

33
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:57,199
Likewise, Mee thinks climate change is sucking the goodness out of the planet and she uses a

34
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:04,479
slang idiom to describe her feelings. It freaks me out. If something freaks you out, it makes you

35
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:11,919
become very emotional, upset or confused. Mee agrees what freaks her out is that governments don't

36
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:18,319
seem to be doing much about the problem. It's not as if we can escape anywhere. Humankind only has

37
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:26,239
one home, planet Earth. Mee calls Earth one in a million, meaning very special or rare. So what can

38
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,159
be done? Psychotherapist Caroline Hickman has visited 10 countries around the world talking to

39
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,639
over 100,000 teenagers about their climate fears. They told her about parents ignoring them when

40
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,079
they wanted to discuss their feelings and adults telling them fixing the planet is your job now.

41
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,599
Here she gives BBC ideas some advice on discussing climate change with children.

42
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:58,960
My advice to adults, parents, teachers, is do not put it off. Don't push it away. Don't save it up

43
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:06,640
and just have that big conversation. Talk about it regularly. That's crucial. And it's okay for

44
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,159
you to say to your children, I don't have all the answers. We're not sure exactly how to deal with

45
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:19,680
all of this, but let's find out together. Caroline's top tip is to discuss the climate crisis regularly

46
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,240
to talk with children about their climate fears and not put it off. Not delay talking about it

47
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:33,360
until later. Caroline also advises parents not to push it away to choose to forget about or ignore

48
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,840
the subject. A better response is to tell kids honestly. We don't have all the answers, but by

49
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,759
sharing ideas we can work things out together. A more hopeful message. A one that shared by

50
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,079
climate champion Greta Tunberg. Yes, and it's time to reveal the answer to my question. How did

51
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:58,079
Greta Tunberg's climate activism begin, Neil? I said it was by skipping school on Fridays.

52
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:05,759
Which was the correct answer. Greta started her school strike for climate in August 2018

53
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:13,839
before it was taken up by over 1.6 million school children from 125 countries around the world.

54
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:20,479
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this program starting with climate anxiety,

55
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:27,040
feeling worried, afraid or depressed because of climate change. A parasite is an animal or plant

56
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:32,879
that feeds off another living thing. If something makes you feel very emotional or upset,

57
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:39,120
you might say it freaks me out. The idiom one in a million describes something which is extremely

58
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,680
special, rare or unlikely. And finally two phrasal verbs to finish with, to put something off,

59
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,920
which means to delay doing it till later and to push something away, which means to decide to

60
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:58,720
forget about or ignore it. Once again, our six minutes are up. But remember to join us again soon

for more trending topics and useful vocabulary here at six minutes English. Goodbye for now.

62
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,199
Goodbye.
