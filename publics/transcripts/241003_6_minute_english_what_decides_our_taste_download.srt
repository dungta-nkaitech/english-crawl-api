00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,679
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Phil.

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,560
And I'm Beth. Now let's talk about food.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:21,559
Okay, what food do you love? What food do you hate? If you ask around you'll soon see

5
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:26,160
there's no right or wrong answer. It's all a question of taste.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,839
But our taste, it turns out, isn't simply a matter of opinion.

7
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:37,240
Rather, scientists have discovered that taste is influenced by our genes and DNA.

8
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,920
So in this programme we'll be asking, what is taste? Why can't we agree on it?

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,719
And is it worth listening to experts whose job is to tell us what to eat and drink?

10
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,519
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

11
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,160
Great, but first I have a question for you, Beth.

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,240
A good way of finding out about British tastes is with the nation's best love snack.

13
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:09,400
Crisps. So what is the most popular flavour of crisps in the UK?

14
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,000
Is it a salt and vinegar,

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,480
b, cheese and onion,

16
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,040
or c, prawn cocktail?

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,680
I'm going to guess cheese and onion.

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,760
Okay, Beth, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

19
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,520
Scientists' understanding of how taste works started only 25 years ago

20
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,240
with the discovery of taste receptors.

21
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,280
Cells located in the taste buds on your tongue.

22
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,200
But people's taste is unique to them.

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,920
What tastes sweet to me might taste sour or salty to someone else.

24
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,840
And this is because of differences in the receptors we're born with.

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,880
In other words, taste is partly genetic.

26
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,400
Here's Danielle Reid, researcher at the Menel Chemical Census Centre in Philadelphia,

27
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,480
explaining more to BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain.

28
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,680
When we first started doing genetic studies,

29
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,920
we really just confined ourselves to looking at a few European,

30
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,560
people of European ancestry.

31
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,719
And so our understanding of the broad diversity of humans on the planet

32
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,199
was extremely limited.

33
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:25,400
We are broadening our horizons in studying people of Asian and African ancestry.

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:32,199
And that has really opened up the knowledge that people are much more diverse

35
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,280
than we ever realised.

36
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,639
And what you're saying is, no taste isn't a matter of opinion.

37
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,400
It's a matter of biology.

38
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,199
Exactly. And we wouldn't, you know, for our friends who are colourblind,

39
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:50,560
we wouldn't chastise them for not being able to see red or for dressing in colours we don't appreciate.

40
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,599
But we feel very free to criticise our friend's sense of taste.

41
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:59,359
It was only when scientists looked outside Europe to the rest of the world

42
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:03,239
that they realised the diversity of human taste.

43
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,879
Danielle says they broadened their horizons.

44
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,839
They investigated something in a new way to increase their knowledge and understanding of it.

45
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,200
Danielle compares taste to another genetically controlled condition,

46
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,759
being colourblind or unable to see the difference between certain colours like green and red.

47
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:29,000
You wouldn't chastise, criticise or punish someone for being colourblind.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,280
So why criticise someone's taste?

49
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,560
But if scientists are telling us taste is largely genetic,

50
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,039
what about restaurant critics and wine connoisseurs?

51
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:43,840
People whose job it is to tell us what to eat and drink.

52
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,639
Are there opinions any better than our own?

53
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:52,079
Here's David Komode, wine judge for the international wine and spirits competition,

54
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,439
speaking with Ruth Alexander for BBC World Services, The Food Chain.

55
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,479
Scientists have established that taste is individual,

56
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:04,399
and to a large extent, actually genetic.

57
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:09,959
So I wonder does that render the wine competition a pointless exercise?

58
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:16,280
No, I would say that wouldn't I, but of course, individual taste is subjective.

59
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,920
We all have our own personal prejudices in whatever sphere of life you want to go into,

60
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:28,840
but we are encouraged, I mean, ordered almost to park those prejudices.

61
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,879
Since people's tastes are naturally different,

62
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:35,680
Ruth asks if wine competitions are pointless,

63
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,480
without purpose and a waste of time.

64
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,000
Being a wine judge, David, of course, disagrees, using the phrase,

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,800
but I would say that wouldn't I.

66
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,600
This phrase means something like, of course, I would say that.

67
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,920
It implies there's some reason that what the speaker is saying is obviously biased towards them.

68
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,759
David admits that taste is subjective,

69
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,680
based on personal opinions and feelings rather than on facts.

70
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,360
And I think it's time to reveal the answer to your question, Phil.

71
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,520
Right, I asked the Britain's most popular flavour of crisp,

72
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,639
and you said cheese and onion, which was the correct answer.

73
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,840
OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme,

74
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,400
starting with the phrase, to broaden or expand your horizons,

75
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,040
meaning to explore something in a new way,

76
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,879
which increases your knowledge and understanding of it.

77
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:33,960
To chest eyes means to strongly punish or criticise.

78
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:38,279
A colourblind person is unable to distinguish certain colours,

79
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,959
especially greens and reds.

80
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,439
Something which is pointless has no purpose or meaning,

81
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,759
and is a waste of time.

82
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,799
The phrase, I would say that wouldn't I.

83
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:53,679
It's a tag question, meaning, of course, I would say that.

84
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:56,359
And finally, if something is subjective,

85
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:59,479
it's influenced by personal beliefs or feelings,

86
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:01,639
rather than based on facts.

87
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:03,839
Once again, our six minutes are up.

88
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,719
Goodbye for now.

89
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:05,719
Bye.
