Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,760
I'm Neil.

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,719
And I'm Sam.

6
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:19,719
Do you cry easily, Sam?

7
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,839
I mean, when was the last time you cried?

8
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,120
Let me think.

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,839
Last week, watching a movie, probably.

10
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,080
I was watching a really dramatic film,

11
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,719
and in one scene, the heroine gets separated from her children.

12
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:34,239
I just burst out crying.

13
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,079
How about you, Neil?

14
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:37,039
When was the last time you cried?

15
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:39,759
Oh, men don't cry, Sam.

16
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,039
Oh, come on, Neil.

17
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,439
That's a bit stereotypical, isn't it?

18
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:45,920
The idea that men don't show their emotions

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,399
and women cry all the time?

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,560
Well, that's an interesting point, Sam,

21
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,039
because in today's programme, we're discussing crying.

22
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:56,679
We'll be investigating the reasons why we cry

23
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:59,560
and looking at some of the differences between men and women

24
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,640
and between crying in public and in private.

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,599
And of course, we'll be learning some related vocabulary along the way.

26
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,960
I guess it's kind of true that women do cry more than men.

27
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,319
People often think crying is only about painful feelings,

28
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:16,319
but we also cry to show joy

29
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:21,079
and when we're moved by something beautiful, like music or a painting.

30
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:24,400
So maybe women are just more in touch with their feelings

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,159
and that's why they cry more.

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,799
Well, actually, Sam, that brings me to our quiz question.

33
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:32,159
According to a study from 2017,

34
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,439
conducted in the UK, on average,

35
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,039
how many times a year do women cry?

36
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:42,039
Is it A, 52, B, 72, or C, 102?

37
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:45,039
Hmm, what's a tricky question, Neil?

38
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:48,280
I mean, there's so many different reasons why people cry

39
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,640
and what makes me cry might make someone else laugh.

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,799
I think some of my female friends probably cry around once a week,

41
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,400
so I'll guess the answer is A, 52.

42
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,200
Okay, Sam, we'll find out later if you were right.

43
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,920
Now, while it may be true that men cry less often,

44
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,759
it also seems that they feel less embarrassed about crying in public.

45
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,639
This may be because of differences in how men and women think others

46
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,879
will view their public displays of emotion.

47
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:22,519
Here's BBC Radio 4's Women's Hour,

48
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:27,719
speaking to therapists Joanna Cross about the issue of crying at work.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,159
So let's take the workplace.

50
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:34,039
If you've got somebody who seems to cry regularly,

51
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:36,439
I think that's not helpful for the individual,

52
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:41,079
because then if they cry over something that really is important to them,

53
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:44,400
they might not be taken seriously or they get a label.

54
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,719
But I do think crying is often a build-up of frustration

55
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,879
and undelt with situations.

56
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,919
And it's a bit of a final straw moment.

57
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,280
So people who regularly cry at work risk not being taken seriously,

58
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,560
not being treated as deserving attention or respect.

59
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,120
And they might even get a label become thought of as having a particular character,

60
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,280
whether that's true or not.

61
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,759
Here's Joanna Cross again.

62
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,240
You build up your resentment, your lack of boundaries,

63
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,479
not being able to say, no,

64
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,479
and then somebody says, can you make a cup of tea

65
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:21,319
and you suddenly find yourself wheezing?

66
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:23,319
And everybody says, what's wrong with her?

67
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:28,199
You know, but actually that's often a backlog of situations.

68
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:35,879
So a common reason for crying at work seems to be a build-up of resentment.

69
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,079
Feelings of anger when you think you've been treated unfairly

70
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:42,000
or have been forced to accept something you don't like.

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,120
When left undelt with, these feelings can create a backlog

72
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,120
and accumulation of issues that you should have dealt with before, but didn't.

73
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,480
Right. And then, like Joanna says,

74
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,439
someone asks you to do something very simple and easy,

75
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:00,840
like make a cup of tea, and you start weeping another word for crying.

76
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,879
That's a good example of a final straw moment,

77
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:06,360
a term which comes from the expression,

78
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,240
the straw that broke the camel's back.

79
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,960
The final straw means a further problem,

80
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,680
which itself might be insignificant,

81
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,319
but which finally makes you want to give up.

82
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:20,199
I hope this programme won't be the final straw for us, Sam.

83
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,560
I doubt it, Neil.

84
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,560
The only time I cry at work is when you used to bring in your onion sandwiches for lunch.

85
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,800
In fact, I can feel a tear rolling down my cheek right now.

86
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,680
Ah, so that counts as one of your cries, Sam.

87
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,879
Remember, I asked you on average how many times a year women in the UK cry, and you said...

88
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,519
I said, A52.

89
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:45,319
Well, don't cry when I tell you that you were wrong.

90
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:48,279
The actual answer was 72 times a year.

91
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,759
Which, on average, is more than men,

92
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,240
but less than parents of newborn babies, both mothers and fathers,

93
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,279
they cry almost as much as their babies.

94
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:02,759
Today we've been talking about crying, or weeping, as it's sometimes called.

95
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,399
People who often cry at work risk not being taken seriously,

96
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:11,319
not treated as deserving of attention or respect.

97
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,639
This means they might get a label,

98
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,920
becoming known as someone with a particular kind of personality,

99
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,480
even though that may not be true.

100
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,480
But crying is also a healthy way of expressing emotions.

101
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,480
It can help deal with resentments,

102
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,719
feelings of anger that you have been treated unfairly.

103
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:31,800
If we don't deal with these feelings in some way,

104
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,879
they can grow into a backlog,

105
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:38,839
an accumulation of unresolved issues that you now need to deal with.

106
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:42,359
And if you don't deal with them, you might become a ticking bomb,

107
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:44,279
waiting to explode.

108
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:48,039
Then anything someone says to you can become the final straw.

109
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:51,560
The last small problem, which makes you want to give up,

110
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,079
and maybe start crying.

111
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:57,000
What's the masoniel?

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,279
Was it something I said?

113
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:02,199
No, sir, I'm crying because it's the end of the programme.

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Well, don't worry, because we'll be back soon for another edition of

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,199
Six Minute English.

116
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,079
Bye-bye for now.

117
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,199
Bye.

118
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,560
Six-year-old English from the BBC.
