Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,320
And I'm Sam.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,199
In this program, we'll be looking at an unusual food called microalgae,

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,719
and asking whether eating algae might be better for our health and the health of the planet.

7
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,879
And of course, we'll be looking at some of the related vocabulary along the way.

8
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:36,079
Yuck. I'm not sure about eating algae, Neil.

9
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,719
I mean, what's the strangest thing you've ever eaten?

10
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,000
Well, I once tried fried stick insects in Thailand, and I've had ants as well,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
that were from Colombia.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,759
Uh, okay, yeah. Both fairly strange for us here in the UK,

13
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,239
but what about pond scum, Neil?

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,039
Pond scum. Pond scum is the slang name for microalgae,

15
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,400
green plant organisms such as spirulina, which grow in water, like ponds,

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,599
and look a bit slimy or scummy before being dried.

17
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,120
Here, we're talking about edible algae, meaning it's okay to eat.

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,879
More than okay. In fact, these types of food algae are actually good for your body.

19
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,040
Microalgae, like spirulina and clorella, are packed full of proteins, vitamins,

20
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,400
and antioxidants. Because they are so healthy, they're having a moment right now,

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,440
meaning they are becoming more well-known and popular.

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,360
Yes, microalgae is trending just now and for good reasons, which we'll find out about later.

23
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,080
But first, let me ask you our quiz question.

24
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,719
What do the following three things have in common?

25
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,080
Oceans, snow, and my garden patio.

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,760
Is it, hey, they are all good places to relax?

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,600
B, they are all very cold, or C, they are all places where microalgae grow.

28
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:01,120
Okay, well, I know that oceans and snow are made up of water, but your garden patio,

29
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,080
did your barbecue get rained off again, Neil?

30
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,360
Not quite, Sam.

31
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, hopefully you'll know by the end of the program.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,960
Now, I mentioned before that microalgae is sometimes called a superfood.

33
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,240
A type of food which is essentially full of healthy vitamins, minerals, and nutrients.

34
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,000
But microalgae is not the first superfood to become popular.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,400
That's right. In the early 2010s, many juice bars started popping up in places around the world

36
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,840
selling green smoothies. Energy drinks made by blending healthy ingredients like

37
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,439
kale, chard, and spinach. The recent trend for microalgae and spirulina

38
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:46,319
has been promoted in part by big drinks companies wanting to sell the latest brightly coloured smoothies.

39
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,639
And more and more, spirulina is also being used as a cooking ingredient in hot dogs and meatballs,

40
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,639
and as a protein rich substitute for eggs in pasta and mayonnaise.

41
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,039
But as well as all these health benefits, there's another advantage to microalgae superfoods,

42
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,919
one that could potentially benefit the whole planet.

43
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,199
BBC Radio 4's The Food Programme, as Professor Alison Smith,

44
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,199
head of Plant Sciences at Cambridge University, to explain.

45
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,839
As the population of the world increases and the land that's available for agriculture

46
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:27,919
is becoming stretched, there's an interest in trying to increase productivity by other means,

47
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,959
so sustainable intensification of agriculture is one way.

48
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,240
So food security is an issue, making sure enough nutritionally rich food is produced to feed

49
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,920
the growing world population. Alison Smith says the amount of agricultural land available for

50
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,520
growing food is becoming stretched, meaning there are not enough resources, in this case,

51
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,520
farmland to meet everyone's needs. Yes, and she mentions that one possible solution is

52
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:02,160
sustainable intensification of agriculture, which means increasing food production in ways

53
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:08,800
which don't damage the environment or use new land. Well, we know that microalgae are superfoods,

54
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,160
nutritionally rich in vitamins and protein, but how do they help reduce the need for agricultural

55
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:21,840
land? Alison Smith explains. They can be grown in all sorts of locations in water, in the oceans,

56
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:30,000
in ponds, lakes and so on, even on your patio and on snow. So one of the possibilities is to produce

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,159
these organisms in cities and towns because they don't need the open landscape to be grown.

58
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:41,599
I think I've spotted the answer to your quiz question, Neil. Oh yes, I asked what oceans,

59
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:48,799
snow and my patio have in common. A, they're all good places to relax. B, they're all very cold.

60
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,480
C, they are all places where microalgae grow. The answer is C, places where microalgae can grow.

61
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,720
What an amazing plant. I think I'm going to stop calling it Ponscum and use the correct

62
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,360
scientific name Professor Smith mentioned, organisms. Today's program was all about microalgae,

63
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,160
like spirulina, a green edible food algae, which some people call Ponscum, although scientifically

64
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,320
speaking, it's an organism, meaning an animal or plant life form. Yes, and this plant life form is

65
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,720
also called a superfood because it's especially rich in vitamins, minerals and nutrients which

66
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,879
promote good health. Superfoods are having a moment right now, meaning they're becoming more popular

67
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:41,360
or trending because they're so healthy. And another benefit of microalgae is that it grows almost

68
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,439
anywhere. So it doesn't use much agricultural land, which is becoming stretched, meaning there's

69
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:53,520
not enough of it to meet the world's food needs. Sustainable intensification is another possible

70
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,960
solution to this problem because it is a way of increasing food production without harming the

71
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,400
environment or using new land. Don't forget you can find lots more learning materials and

72
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,960

73
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:18,319
Bye.
