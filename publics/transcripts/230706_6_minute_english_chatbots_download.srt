00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,759
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,120
And I'm Rob.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,600
Now, I'm sure most of us have interacted with a chatbot.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,559
These are bits of computer technology that respond to text with text

6
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,160
or respond to your voice. You ask it a question,

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,800
and usually it comes up with an answer.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,600
Yes, it's almost like talking to another human,

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,920
but of course it's not. It's just a clever piece of technology.

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,679
It's becoming more sophisticated, more advanced and complex,

11
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,960
but could they replace real human interaction altogether?

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,400
We'll discuss that more in a moment and find out if chatbots really think for themselves.

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,519
But first, I have a question for you, Rob.

14
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:57,120
The first computer program that allowed some kind of plausible conversation between humans and

15
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:02,559
machines was invented in 1966. But what was it called?

16
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,799
Was it a Alexa, b, Eliza or c, Parry?

17
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,280
Well, it's not Alexa. That's too new. So I'll guess c, Parry.

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,000
I'll reveal the answer at the end of the program.

19
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,159
Now, the old chatbots of the 1960s and 70s were quite basic,

20
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,799
but more recently, the technology is able to predict the next word

21
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,319
that is likely to be used in a sentence, and it learns words and sentence structures.

22
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:37,920
It's clever stuff. I've experienced using them when talking to my bank or when I have problems

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,799
trying to book a ticket on a website. I no longer phone a human. I speak to a virtual assistant instead.

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,759
Probably the most well-known chatbot at the moment is chatGTP.

25
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,400
It is. The claim is that it's able to answer anything you ask it.

26
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,000
This includes writing students essays. Now, this is something that was discussed on the BBC

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,960
Radio 4 program, Word of Mouth. Emily M. Bender, professor of computational linguistics at the

28
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,960
University of Washington, explained why it's dangerous to always trust what a chatbot is telling us.

29
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:21,599
We tend to react to grammatical, fluent coherence-seeming text as authoritative and reliable

30
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,439
and valuable. We need to be on guard against that because what's coming out of chatGPT is none of that.

31
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:33,120
So, Professor Bender says that well-written text that is coherent, that means it's clear,

32
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,439
carefully considered and sensible, makes us think what we are reading is reliable and authoritative.

33
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,959
So, it's respected, accurate and important sounding.

34
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:49,199
Yes, chatbots might appear to write in this way, but really, they are just predicting one word after

35
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:55,679
another based on what they have learned. We should therefore be on guard, be careful and alert

36
00:02:55,679 --> 00:03:02,479
about the accuracy of what we are being told. One concern is that chatbots, a form of artificial

37
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:08,399
intelligence, work a bit like a human brain in the way it can learn and process information.

38
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:12,879
They're able to learn from experience, something called deep learning.

39
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,719
A cognitive psychologist and computer scientist called Jeffrey Hinton recently said he feared

40
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:24,400
that chatbots could soon overtake the level of information that a human brain holds.

41
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,159
That's a bit scary, isn't it?

42
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,400
Hmm, but for now, chatbots can be useful for practical information, but sometimes we start to believe

43
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,639
they are human and we interact with them in a human-like way. This can make us believe them even more.

44
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,560
Professor Emma Bender, speaking on the BBC's Word of Mouth program, explains why we might feel like that.

45
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,599
I think what's going on there is the kinds of answers you get depend on the questions you put in

46
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,879
because it's doing likely next word, likely next word, and so if as the human interacting with

47
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,560
this machine, you start asking questions about how do you feel, you know, chatbot? And what do you

48
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,000
think of this? And what are your goals? You can provoke it to say things that sound like what a

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,759
sentient entity would say. We are really primed to imagine a mind behind language whenever we

50
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:18,240
encounter language. And so we really have to account for that when we're making decisions about these.

51
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:26,319
So although a chatbot might sound human, we really just ask it things to get a reaction. We provoke it.

52
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:33,199
And it answers only with words it's learned to use before, not because it has come up with a clever answer.

53
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,839
But it does sound like a sentient entity. Sentient describes a living thing that experiences feelings.

54
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,479
As Professor Bender says, we imagine that when something speaks, there is a mind behind it.

55
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,319
But sorry Neil, they are not your friend, they're just machines.

56
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:57,199
Yes, it's strange then that we sometimes give chatbots names, Alexa, Siri, had earlier I asked you

57
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,239
what the name was for the first ever chatbot. And I guess it was Perry, was I right?

58
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,879
You guessed wrong, I'm afraid. Perry was an early form of chatbot from 1972.

59
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:15,759
But the correct answer was Eliza. It was considered to be the first chatbot as it was called then

60
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,519
and was developed by Joseph Weisenbaum at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

61
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:27,199
Fascinating stuff. Okay, now let's recap some of the vocabulary we highlighted in this program,

62
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:33,279
starting with sophisticated, which can describe technology that is advanced and complex.

63
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,680
Something that is coherent is clear, carefully considered and sensible.

64
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,400
Athorotative means respected, accurate and important sounding.

65
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,240
When you are on guard, you must be careful and alert about something.

66
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,319
It could be the accuracy of what you see or hear, or just being aware of the dangers around you.

67
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,800
To provoke means to do something that causes a reaction from someone.

68
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,000
Sentient describes something that experiences feelings, so it's something that is living.

69
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,079
Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye. Bye for now.

70
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,079
It's me, English from BBCLearningEnglish.com.
