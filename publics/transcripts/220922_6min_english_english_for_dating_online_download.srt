00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Sam

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And I'm Roy.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Nowadays, many people use online dating apps to find love and romance.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This involves writing a dating profile.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Your description of yourself, which you hope, makes you appear attractive to other people looking for love online.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Online dating started with the internet, but the idea is not new.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In the days before the internet, people put dating adverts in newspapers.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Because they paid a price per word, people describe themselves in as few words as possible.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Using abbreviations like GSOH, which meant a good sense of humour.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Eventually, GSOH became part of everyday English.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Amazingly, the same thing is now happening in the world of online dating.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
In this programme, we'll be learning some of the newly invented words and phrases

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
being used by people who are looking for love on the internet.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Every year, thousands of romantic relationships start through online dating apps.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But as always, with information found on the internet, there's a danger that someone's dating profile

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
doesn't tell the whole truth.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That's right, Roy. So my question is this.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
According to research, what do men tend to lie about in their dating profile?

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Is it A, the hair, B, the height, or C, their age?

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Well, most people want to appear younger, so I'll say it's C, their age.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We'll find out if that's the correct answer later.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The person behind the online dating research I mentioned was Dr. Nicola Fox Hamilton.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
She describes herself as a cyber psychologist and has interviewed both men and women

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
about what they hide from potential online dating partners.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Listen, as she tells BBC Radio 4's Word of Mouth, what she discovered from her interviews.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If you're very deceptive, so if you have no friends and you never go to the pub

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
and you said in your profile that your most fun thing to do is hanging out with your friends on a Saturday night,

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
then that becomes a problem because then you've been very deceptive.

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If you occasionally do it and you made it sound a bit more like you do it all the time,

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
that's more exaggeration. A lot of people do that, where they exaggerate things about themselves

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
to make them seem more attractive, but they're walking a fine line and trying to balance between being attractive

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and not completely disappointing.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
People often exaggerate things about themselves to seem more attractive online.

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
For example, that they love hanging out or spending time with friends.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Nicola also says there's a difference between exaggerating and being deceptive,

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
deliberately lying and making someone believe things that are not true.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Nicola says deceptive data are walking a fine or thin line.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
They're finding a balance between two opposing attitudes or ideas.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Online dating has also created new vocabulary of its own.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Here's Nicola Fox Hamilton again explaining the meaning of two new words,

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
catfishing and woke fishing to BBC Radio 4's Word of Mouth.

44
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Woke fishing is a version of catfishing and catfishing is where someone creates a profile that isn't them at all,

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
so a complex false identity, usually with the purpose of looking for or pretending to get involved in love or romance.

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Woke fishing is where the person is generally who they say they are,

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
but they say that they're much more liberal in their values and political attitudes than they actually are.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Catfishing is when someone tries to be more attractive by creating a false profile

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and pretending to be someone else on social media.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What's related to this is the term woke fishing.

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Here someone asks about your political and social opinions and pretends to share them in order to get closer to you.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
They may pretend to have more liberal or progressive attitudes than they really do.

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Looking for love is never easy.

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The internet has helped thousands find romance and created some interesting new vocabulary,

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
but there are dangers and disappointments too.

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Which it's time to reveal the answer to your question, Sam.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You asked what men tend to lie about in their dating profiles. I guessed it was their age.

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You were wrong.

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,000
According to research by Dr. Fox Hamilton, men tend to lie about their height and women about their weight.

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay, let's recap the new vocabulary we've learnt in this programme about the language of online romance,

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
starting with dating profile, a brief written description of yourself which you hope will attract a partner.

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Being deceptive means lying so people believe something that is not true.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hanging out is an informal way to say spending time with someone, usually friends.

64
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The phrase walking a fine line means finding a balance between two opposing ideas or attitudes or between two opposing sides

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
so as not to annoy either side.

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And finally, we learnt two newly invented expressions.

67
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Catfishing means trying to appear more attractive by pretending to be someone else on social media.

68
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And woke fishing is when someone pretends to share the same liberal opinions as the person they are attracted to.

69
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Once again, our six minutes are a good luck if you are looking for love online.

70
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And remember, there's probably someone out there interested in the real you.

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Bye for now.
