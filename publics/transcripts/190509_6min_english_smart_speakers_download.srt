3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,399
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Dan and I'm Rob.

4
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,199
So Dan, what's a- oh, sorry.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh it's my wife.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,000
Hang on.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,000
You didn't answer.

8
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,960
Well, don't take this personally, Dan, but I'm not exactly crazy about someone

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,719
eavesdropping on my phone call.

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,719
If you eavesdrop on something, you secretly listen to someone's conversation.

11
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,000
Something's a private, you know.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,560
Oh, of course, I totally understand.

13
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,359
One quick question for you, though.

14
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,960
Do you have a smart speaker, you know, like Google Assistant,

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,679
Amazon's Alexa, or Apple's Siri?

16
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,039
Ah sure, yes, I've got one.

17
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,079
It's great.

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,159
I can ask it all sorts of questions.

19
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:59,039
It tells me about the news and whether it plays music, when I want, it does all sorts.

20
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,079
You just give it a voice command and it does what you want.

21
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,679
So it can hear you, can it?

22
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:04,640
Of course.

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,599
How else can you give it a voice command all the time?

24
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:08,879
Well, I assume so.

25
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,039
So how do you know it's not eavesdropping on you?

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,560
Well, I, uh, oh, I see.

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,920
I hadn't thought of that.

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,560
Well, that's our topic for this 6 Minute English.

29
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,959
How safe is your smart speaker?

30
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,759
However, before that, here is our quiz question.

31
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,879
By what percentage the number of smart speakers used in US households increased

32
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,079
from December 2017 to December 2018?

33
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:38,079
Is it a around 40%, b around 60% or c around 80%.

34
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,920
Oh, well, I know they are very popular even in my household.

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,879
So I'm going to go for c around 80%.

36
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:47,920
Well, we'll find out if you're right later in the program.

37
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,640
So smart speakers and privacy.

38
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,400
Florian Schalb is an assistant professor at the University of Michigan School of Information.

39
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,439
Here he is speaking on the BBC World Service Program,

40
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,680
the wife factor about smart speakers.

41
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,359
What does he say people are introducing into their homes?

42
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,759
You're basically introducing listening bug in your home in your most intimate space.

43
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,400
While the companies say they're only actively listened to what's going on in your home

44
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,479
when they hear the keyword, the microphone is still on the whole time in order to be able to

45
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:25,119
detect that keyword. We don't know to what extent companies are cooperating with the government

46
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:30,319
or to what extent the government might try to circumvent companies' security mechanisms

47
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,039
in order to then be able to listen to what you're doing.

48
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,359
So what did he say people are introducing, Rob?

49
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:40,879
He basically said we're introducing a listening bug.

50
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:46,079
Now a bug is a small electronic device used for secretly listening to conversations,

51
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,839
much like a spy would use.

52
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,439
Yes, and he mentioned it was in our most intimate space.

53
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,319
Intimate means private and personal.

54
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,879
Well I can't think of anywhere more intimate than my home. Indeed.

55
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,759
He also said that the smart speakers' microphone is on the whole time,

56
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,640
even though the companies insist that they're only actively listening when the keyword is said.

57
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,280
Yes, he suggested that we can't know how far a company might be cooperating with a government

58
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,080
to eavesdrop on people or whether a government might be circumventing a smart speaker's

59
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,120
security and listening in any way without the company or owner's permission.

60
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,120
Circumvent means cleverly bypass or go round.

61
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,199
So if all this eavesdropping is possible, why are smart speakers so popular?

62
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,199
Good question. And here's Florian Schalber again with an answer.

63
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,159
He conducted a study on people's attitudes to privacy when it came to smart speakers.

64
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,400
How do people feel about having a smart speaker that could eavesdrop on them?

65
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,639
What we often saw as people just being resigned to this is the tradeoff they have to make

66
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,479
if they want to enjoy the convenience that a smart speaker provides to them.

67
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,280
He said that people are resigned to the privacy tradeoff.

68
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,479
If you're resigned to something, you accept something unpleasant that can't be changed.

69
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,039
Yes, and a tradeoff is a compromise.

70
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,560
You accept something bad to also receive something good.

71
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,839
So people accept that a smart speaker gives them advantages, even though there could be

72
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:23,839
downsides. Yes. In the grand scheme of things, the data that these devices here is probably not

73
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,319
that significant considering all the data companies have about us already anyway.

74
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,159
So can I have the answer to the quiz then? Of course.

75
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:38,000
Earlier I asked by what percentage the number of smart speakers used in US households

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,240
increased from December 2017 to December 2018. Was it A, around 40%, B, around 60%, or C,

77
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,920
around 80%. What did you say, Rob? I said C, around 80%. And you are right.

78
00:04:51,920 --> 00:05:01,439
C, the answer is around 80%. From 66 million in December 2017 to 118 million in December 2018,

79
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:07,920
and around 10 million people in the UK now use one too. I guess they're not worried about eavesdrops.

80
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Nice slide into the vocabulary there, Dan. If someone eavesdrops on you, it means they secretly

81
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,759
listen to your conversation. They could be eavesdropping on you through a bug, which is a small

82
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,600
electronic device used to secretly listen to conversations. Yes, they may have bugged your most

83
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,839
intimate or private and personal spaces. Next we had circumvent. If you circumvent something,

84
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,399
such as security, you cleverly bypass it or go around it. Then we had resigned. If you are

85
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:44,560
resigned to something, it means you accept something unpleasant that can't be changed. And lastly,

86
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,719
we had trade-off. A trade-off is a compromise. You get something good, but you also get something

87
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,879
bad. Right, like six minutes English, a great discussion and vocabulary, but the trade-off is

88
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:03,040
it only lasts six minutes, which is just about now actually time to go. So until next time,

89
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:09,120
find us all over the place online and on social media. Just search for BBC Learning English.

90
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,399
Bye for now. Goodbye.
