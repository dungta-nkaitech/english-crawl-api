00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:15,839
Hello, this is 6-minute English with me, Neil.

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:16,879
And me Sam.

7
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:18,800
Today, we're talking rubbish.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,920
Oh, it's a bit harsh. I thought it was going to be interesting.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,640
I mean our topic is about rubbish, not that we are rubbish.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,160
I see. Okay, do go on.

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,159
Thank you. So the amount of waste we produce around the world is huge and it's a growing problem.

12
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,679
But there are some things that we can do like recycling.

13
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,399
Where I live, I can recycle a lot and I'm always very careful to separate,

14
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,400
to split my rubbish into paper, metal, food, plastic and so on.

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,439
But is that enough, even if we all do it?

16
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, look a little more at this topic shortly, but first, as always, a question.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,760
Which country recycles the highest percentage of its waste?

18
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,640
Is it A, Sweden, B, Germany or C, New Zealand?

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,839
What do you think, Sam?

20
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:06,399
Well, I'm not sure, but I think it could be Germany,

21
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,560
so I'm going to go without Germany.

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,280
Okay, well, we'll see if you're right a little later on.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,319
The BBC Radio Programme Business Daily recently tackled this topic.

24
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,759
They spoke to Alexander Lemiel, an expert in this area.

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,359
Does he think recycling is the answer?

26
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,959
Let's hear what he said.

27
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:30,079
We're cycling is not the answer to waste from an efficient point of view,

28
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:36,319
because we are not able to get all the waste separated properly

29
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,359
and therefore treat it in the background.

30
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,039
The main objective of our model is to hide waste.

31
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:47,839
So we don't see as urban citizens or rural citizens.

32
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:52,159
We don't see the waste. It is out of sight and therefore out of mind.

33
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,799
What's his view of recycling?

34
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,439
I was a bit surprised because he said recycling wasn't the answer.

35
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,239
One reason is that it's not always possible to separate waste you can recycle

36
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,479
from waste you can't recycle and that makes treating it very difficult.

37
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,800
Treating means handling it and using different processes, so it can be used again.

38
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,199
And the result is a lot of waste, including waste that could be recycled,

39
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,560
but which is just hidden.

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,079
And as long as we don't see it, we don't think about it.

41
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,480
And he uses a good phrase to describe this,

42
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,440
out of sight, out of mind.

43
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,680
And that's true, at least for me.

44
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,720
My rubbish and recycling is collected and I don't really think about what happens to it after that.

45
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,280
Is as much of it recycled as I think or is it buried, burned or even sent to other countries?

46
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,200
It's not in front of my house, so I don't really think about it.

47
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,360
Out of sight, out of mind.

48
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,240
Let's listen again.

49
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:56,080
recycling is not the answer to waste from an efficient point of view,

50
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,960
because we are not able to get all the waste separated properly and therefore

51
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,800
treated in the background.

52
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,040
The main objective of our model is to hide waste.

53
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,200
So we don't see as urban citizens or rural citizens, we don't see the waste.

54
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,080
It is out of sight and therefore out of mind.

55
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,240
One possible solution to this problem is to develop what is called a circular economy.

56
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,720
Here's the presenter of business daily, Manuel Saragossa, explaining what that means.

57
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,480
The idea then at the core of a circular economic and business model is that a product,

58
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,600
like say a washing machine or even a broom, can always be returned to the manufacturer

59
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,520
to be reused or repaired before then sold on again.

60
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,760
The point is the manufacturer retains responsibility for the life cycle

61
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,840
of the product it produces, rather than the consumer assuming that responsibility when he or she buys it.

62
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400
So it seems like a simple idea, though maybe very difficult to do.

63
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,480
Yes, the idea is that the company that makes a product, the manufacturer, is responsible for the

64
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,080
product, not the person who bought it, the consumer.

65
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,760
So if the product breaks or reaches the end of its useful life, its life cycle,

66
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:19,360
then the manufacturer has to take it back and fix refurbish or have it recycled.

67
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,680
I guess this would make manufacturers try to make their products last longer.

68
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,680
Certainly word, let's listen again.

69
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,599
The idea then at the core of a circular economic and business model is that a product,

70
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:36,719
like say a washing machine or even a broom, can always be returned to the manufacturer

71
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:40,639
to be reused or repaired before then sold on again.

72
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:46,719
The point is the manufacturer retains responsibility for the life cycle of the product it produces,

73
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,959
rather than the consumer assuming that responsibility when he or she buys it.

74
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:56,000
That's just about all we have time for in this program before we recycle the voc-

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,199
Oh, very good, Neil.

76
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,439
Before we, thank you, Sam.

77
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:04,399
Before we recycle the vocabulary, we need to get the answer to today's question.

78
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,599
Which country recycles the highest percentage of its waste?

79
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,760
Is it A, Sweden, B, Germany or C, New Zealand?

80
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,720
Sam, what did you say?

81
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,400
And I said I think it's Germany.

82
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,640
Well, I would like to offer you congratulations.

83
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,000
Yay, fine.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Because Germany is the correct answer.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,800
Yay.

86
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,720
Now let's go over the vocabulary.

87
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,280
Of course.

88
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,960
So two separate means to divide or split different things.

89
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,360
For example, separate your plastic from your paper for recycling.

90
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,520
Treating is the word for dealing with, for example, recycled waste.

91
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,399
The phrase, out of sight, out of mind,

92
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,159
means ignoring something or a situation you can't see.

93
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:45,759
A manufacturer is the person or company that makes something

94
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,879
and the consumer is the person who buys that thing.

95
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,079
And the length of time you can expect a product to work for is known as its life cycle.

96
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,719
Well, the life cycle of this program is six minutes,

97
00:05:56,719 --> 00:06:00,240
and as we are there or thereabouts, it's time for us to head off.

98
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,199
Thanks for your company, and I hope you can join us again soon.

99
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,959
Until then, there's plenty more to enjoy from BBC Learning English online

100
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,039

Bye for now.

102
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,560
Bye.

103
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,519
Bye.
