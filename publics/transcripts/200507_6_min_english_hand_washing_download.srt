From BBC Learning English

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,519
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:21,359
And I'm Georgina. I've got a puzzle for you, Neil. Ready?

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:22,160
Sure.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,320
OK, it's a riddle. I'm as light as a feather, but no one can hold me for very long.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,440
What am I?

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,320
Hmm. As light as a feather, but no one can hold you.

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,880
No idea. What are you?

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,240
Your breath.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,320
Ah, yes, I see.

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,320
OK, then. I've got one for you.

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,960
I'm so big, I'm everywhere, but so small you can't see me.

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,240
What am I?

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,040
You're everywhere, but I can't see you.

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,480
Hmm.

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,240
Tricky. I give up.

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,960
Well, the answer is germs.

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:05,680
And with the outbreak of coronavirus, people around the world have rediscovered the importance of fighting germs to stop the spread of disease.

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,240
In this programme, we'll be discussing the importance of hand washing in the prevention of germs and viruses.

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:21,599
And we'll start off by meeting the first person to realise that keeping hands clean can really help prevent diseases being passed on.

24
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,879
Ah, do you mean the 19th century Hungarian doctor Ignat's civil vice?

25
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:33,599
He was known as the Savior of Mothers for keeping maternity wards germ-free and he had a very interesting life.

26
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:36,000
But do you know what happened to him in the end?

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,599
That's my quiz question.

28
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,399
Was it A, he won the Nobel Prize?

29
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:44,079
B, he ended up in a hospital for mentally ill people,

30
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,479
or C, he started the first company to produce hands-hope.

31
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,280
Dr Semovise sounds like a scientific hero, so I'll say A, he won the Nobel Prize.

32
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,920
Okay, we'll find out later if you were right.

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,560
But what's for sure is that Ignat's Semovise was a hero to vowel Curtis,

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,640
a director at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

35
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,840
Here she is talking to BBC Radio 4's science stories.

36
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,960
Semovise is kind of my patron saint.

37
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:18,000
Handwashing has been my life for the last 30 years working on trying to improve hygiene,

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,520
mostly in developing countries.

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,520
And he was really the first to identify the importance of keeping hands clean in the prevention

40
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,280
of transmission of infection.

41
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,719
And since the beginning of my career working in public health,

42
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,600
I've been trying to understand how diseases get spread and what the best way of preventing it is.

43
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:41,760
And handwashing jumped out as being the most important means of preventing infections,

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,200
particularly in developing countries.

45
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,879
Vals' work is all about improving hygiene,

46
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,479
practices for maintaining health and preventing disease,

47
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,319
especially through cleanliness.

48
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,120
And she was clearly influenced by the work of Dr Semovise because she calls him her patron saint,

49
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,919
a kind of guide and protector, believed to give special help or inspiration.

50
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,479
But Dr Semovise is also a good example of science communication.

51
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,759
Getting the message out so people understand the importance of hygiene is difficult.

52
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,479
And wash your hands, jumped out or made a strong impact as a simple message to communicate.

53
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,079
Here's Vals again.

54
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:29,599
It wasn't until we wrote a paper in 2003 that showed the evidence that handwashing could save

55
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,799
a million lives that actually people started to take it seriously and handwashing became a big

56
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,719
important issue internationally.

57
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:42,560
So for me the lesson from Semovises don't scream and shout and accuse people of doing things wrongly,

58
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,439
but patiently get the data out there and tell your story in a positive way.

59
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:54,319
The idea that handwashing is an essential part of hygiene is supported by scientific evidence.

60
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,640
The facts and information used to show that a belief is true.

61
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,439
In this case Vals' belief that handwashing could help save a million lives.

62
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:09,120
So handwashing has become an important global issue or topic of discussion,

63
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,599
especially in places without access to clean sanitation and toilets.

64
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,680
Vals also mentions that if you want people to listen to your message,

65
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,600
it's better to present the evidence in a positive scientific way instead of screaming and shouting,

66
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,160
speaking in a forceful or even angry way to convince people you're right.

67
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,519
Right, people don't listen if you scream and shout at them.

68
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,280
They just think you're strange.

69
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,079
Which brings me back to today's quiz question.

70
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:39,759
Remember I asked you what happened to Dr. Semovise in the end?

71
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,959
And I said, eh, he won the Nobel Prize.

72
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:48,159
Well, I'm afraid the answer was B, he actually ended up in a hospital for mentally ill people.

73
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:51,439
Today we've been talking about handwashing,

74
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,120
one of the single best ways to improve personal hygiene,

75
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,519
the prevention of disease by keeping clean.

76
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,000
Recently handwashing has become a top global issue,

77
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,680
a subject or topic people are thinking and talking about.

78
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,079
Scientific evidence, the facts and information used to prove ideas true or valid,

79
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:17,600
shows that handwashing jumped out or was easily noticed as one of the most important

80
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,000
methods to stop the spread of infection.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,199
The work of 19th century scientist Ignat Semovise was so inspiring that even today some doctors

82
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:30,399
consider him the patron saint of hygiene.

83
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,479
An expression referring to a protecting or guiding saint

84
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,680
believed to give special help or inspiration.

85
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,399
But communicating the message of wash your hands to people around the world is hard,

86
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:47,360
especially if you just scream and shout or try to convince someone by talking to them in a

87
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,439
forceful or argumentative way.

88
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,919
Okay, Neil, the scientific evidence has convinced me.

89
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,360
I promise to make sure I regularly wash my hands.

90
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,360
That's all from us today, but do join us again soon for more Topical Discussion and Vocabulary

91
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,480
here at BBC Learning English is 6 Minute English.

92
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,759
Stay safe and remember to wash your hands. Bye for now.

93
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:10,879
Bye.
