2
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,919
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:17,519
And I'm Beth. In our lifetime, one in five people will be affected by cancer,

4
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:22,800
a disease where cells grow uncontrollably and cause tumors in the body.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,120
Tumors can be benign, meaning not cancerous or malignant, meaning cancerous,

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:37,039
and in 2022, there were an estimated 9.7 million deaths from malignant cancer's worldwide.

7
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,200
But in this programme, we'll be focusing on some good news instead.

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,880
Vaccines are medicine which protects the human body by making it immune from a certain disease.

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,880
Now there's been a sudden and important discovery, a breakthrough,

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,719
in the development of a new vaccine called mRNA.

11
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,640
So could a vaccine for cancer soon become a reality?

12
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,239
That's what we'll be finding out as well as learning some useful new words and phrases.

13
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,159
And remember, if you like listening to 6 Minute English and want to read along at the same time,

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,200
Now I have a question for you, Beth. We've mentioned some of the most recent vaccines,

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,599
but which disease did the first successful vaccine treat?

18
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:29,919
Was it A, flu, B, polio or C, smallpox?

19
00:01:29,919 --> 00:01:32,159
Oh, I'm going to say polio.

20
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,759
Okay, well, we'll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme.

21
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,679
You might wonder why the body's immune system doesn't fight cancer automatically.

22
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:46,399
The reason is that cancer has clever ways of hiding from unnatural defenses,

23
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,639
as Dr Meredith McKean, Director of Research at Tennessee Oncology,

24
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:53,919
explained to BBC World Service programme, the inquiry.

25
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,760
There's been a number of studies that have demonstrated

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,799
the different techniques that the cancer has developed to be able to put up

27
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,439
signals or proteins essentially on the surface of the cancer cells

28
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,080
to tell the immune system, go away, there's nothing here to look at.

29
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:19,120
And so it's actually been hijacking these receptors to essentially tell the immune system to kind

30
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,960
of take the brakes off and be more aggressive in fighting cancer

31
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,200
that's really allowed a breakthrough with immune therapy over the past decade.

32
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,840
Dr McKean says that a number of studies have demonstrated how cancer spreads.

33
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,200
She uses the phrase a number of to mean several,

34
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,439
but it also makes her statement more convincing, because of course,

35
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:44,080
several studies are better than just one.

36
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,360
Cancer cells switch off the immune system by pretending to be healthy cells.

37
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,240
It's like they're saying nothing to see here,

38
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,520
an informal phrase which can be used to encourage people to move or look away from something,

39
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,560
either in a playful way or to cover something up.

40
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,560
For example, a police officer at a crime scene might say nothing to see here to move people on.

41
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,640
So in other words, cancer hijacks healthy cells.

42
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:16,639
It takes control of something which doesn't belong to it and uses it for its own advantage.

43
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,359
So how would a vaccine change things?

44
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:24,159
Well, existing treatments like chemotherapy aggressively target the cancer,

45
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,159
but also attack healthy tissue, creating unpleasant side effects.

46
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,279
New breakthrough vaccines, on the other hand,

47
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:35,839
retrain the immune system to recognise cancer cells and eliminate those,

48
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:40,319
and only those, naturally, even in patients with the disease already.

49
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:45,759
Here's Professor Eduardo Sanchez of the Anderson Cancer Center in Texas,

50
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:48,879
explaining more to BBC World Services, the inquiry.

51
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:53,199
Basically, the cancer cells are telling the immune system,

52
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,639
don't attack me, don't eat me, right?

53
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:03,599
The immune system has forgotten how to go about recognising those cancer cells,

54
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,039
becoming blind to recognise those aberrations that cancer cells generate,

55
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:16,079
and what we want to do with vaccines is to re-edulcate the immune system.

56
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,839
In cancer patients, the immune system is blind to cancerous growths.

57
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,000
It completely fails to notice them or be aware of their danger.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,879
So the vaccine re-educates the immune system or teaches it to behave in a different way.

59
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:37,039
To recap, some cancer treatments work by unblocking our blocked natural defences,

60
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,160
whereas vaccines retrain the immune system to find an attack cancer cells naturally.

61
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:48,080
Because these two approaches are quite different, they can be used together and individually.

62
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,680
So to answer my original question, Neil, a vaccine for cancer might not be too far away.

63
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,160
But how about your question? Isn't it time you revealed the answer?

64
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,160
I asked which disease was first successfully treated by a vaccine.

65
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,640
And I said, polio, was I right?

66
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,120
You were wrong, I'm afraid, the correct option was C, which is smallpox.

67
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,959
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme,

68
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,599
starting with breakthrough, a sudden, dramatic and important discovery.

69
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:23,919
A number of something means several, or many, and can add credibility to what you say.

70
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,800
The phrase nothing to see here is used to discourage people from paying attention

71
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,319
or looking too closely at something or to move them away.

72
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:38,079
If you hijack something, you use something that doesn't belong to you for your own benefits.

73
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,959
Being blind to something means failing to notice it or recognise it as a threat.

74
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:50,319
And finally, to re-educate means to teach somebody to think or behave in a new or different way.

75
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,600
Once again, our six minutes are up, but if you're hungry for more, head over to our website,

78
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,160
Good luck and we'll see you again soon.

79
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,800
Bye for now.

80
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,439
Goodbye.
