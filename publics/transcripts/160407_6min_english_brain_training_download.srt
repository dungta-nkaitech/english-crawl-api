5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,519
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Sophie.

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,719
Watashiwa Niru.

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:17,760
What did you say?

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,519
Watashiwa Niru.

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,559
I'm Nihil.

10
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:22,320
It's Japanese, Sophie.

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,000
Very good, Nihil.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,960
So your Japanese language lessons are going well then.

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,000
They are indeed.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,640
And did you know Sophie that scientists believe

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,000
learning a second language can boost brain power?

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,560
By linguism, or speaking two languages,

17
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,120
equally well, is a form of brain training.

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,359
Brain training is where you're learning ways

19
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,079
to increase your memory or intelligence.

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,519
That's great, Nihil.

21
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:48,640
But you're not exactly by lingual, are you?

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,719
Ah, not yet, no.

23
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,240
Well, brain training is the subject of today's show.

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,000
And ways to train your brain

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,079
might be doing a crossword puzzle,

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,440
playing chess, or studying a new language.

27
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,280
Now, I have a question for you, Nihil.

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,680
Ooh, I hope my brain is up to the challenge.

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,719
I'm sure it is.

30
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:10,320
Can you tell me how many neurons or nerve cells

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,719
are there in the typical human brain?

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,000
Is it A, 8.6 billion, B, 86 billion,

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,879
or C, 860 billion?

34
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:24,399
I'm going to say A, 8.6 billion.

35
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:26,560
Well, we'll find out later on in the show

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,959
whether you got the answer right or not.

37
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,159
But now, let's listen to neuropsychologists

38
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,000
Dr. Catherine Love Day.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,399
Talking about why being bilingual

40
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:38,319
may protect your brain from damage

41
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,599
if you have a stroke.

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,280
I think the theory behind why

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,719
bilingualism might be a protective factor is that

44
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:47,840
involves a lot of switching,

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,280
there's a lot of attentional changes,

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,159
there's a lot of switching,

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,719
and that seems to exercise the sort of executive parts

48
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,920
of our brain.

49
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,680
Those parts of the brain are then kind of stronger

50
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,079
and fitter when it comes to resisting

51
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,159
some kind of damage from a stroke.

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,760
A stroke is a serious illness that occurs

53
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,200
when blood flow to an area of the brain is cut off.

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,080
And executive functions are the mental skills

55
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,439
involved in doing things like problem solving and planning.

56
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,639
So, when a bilingual speaker switches

57
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:19,599
or changes from one language to another,

58
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,199
this exercises the executive parts of their brain,

59
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,519
making it stronger and fitter.

60
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:27,519
And because the brain is stronger,

61
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:30,559
it's able to resist or prevent

62
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:32,559
damage caused by a stroke.

63
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:34,959
But many of us aren't bilingual, are we?

64
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,560
So our brains aren't going to be protected against strokes.

65
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,839
Don't worry, Neil.

66
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:43,039
There are other things you can do to exercise your brain.

67
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,479
If you're right-handed,

68
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,759
doing tasks like brushing your teeth with your left hand

69
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,759
will stimulate your brain.

70
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,560
Or getting dressed in the dark with your eyes shut,

71
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,359
or simply memorising a list of words.

72
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:57,519
For example, your shopping list.

73
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,239
Doing things with the wrong hand sounds hard,

74
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,479
but the shopping list thing sounds easier.

75
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,439
Okay, let's see.

76
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,439
Pizza.

77
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,039
Donuts.

78
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,039
Crisps.

79
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,879
Bottle of Coke.

80
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,159
Chocolate cake.

81
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,799
That's not a very healthy list, Neil.

82
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,039
A good diet is also important in keeping your brain fit and healthy.

83
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,479
Err, maybe I should cut down on the chocolate cake, then.

84
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,159
Actually, that's one thing you could leave on the list.

85
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,800
According to research,

86
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,280
chocolate may enhance or improve cognitive performance.

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,359
And that is your ability to acquire and utilise knowledge.

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,079
Now, let's listen to Dr. Love Day

89
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,800
talking about building up our cognitive reserve.

90
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,480
This is the idea of building up extra abilities

91
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,240
to help protect the brain against declining memory or thinking.

92
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,840
Continually, just stimulating the brain,

93
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,680
things like learning a language,

94
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,880
learning music,

95
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,720
just educating yourself,

96
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,600
seems to continue to build up that cognitive reserve.

97
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,800
So even if people take up languages or take up other things later in life,

98
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,560
it will give them a degree of protection.

99
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,599
Stimulate means to make something become more active.

100
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,079
Hmm, not sure I'm continually stimulating my brain.

101
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,120
What do you think, Sophie?

102
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,319
With all our stimulating discussions, Neil,

103
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,120
I'm sure we're both building up our cognitive reserve.

104
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,759
And there are your Japanese lessons, too.

105
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,160
Well, so I am doing well as far as my cognitive reserve goes.

106
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,399
Sophie, you've put my mind at rest.

107
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,079
And if you put someone's mind at rest, you stop them worrying.

108
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,800
Well, don't get too relaxed, Neil.

109
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,599
Your brain needs constant stimulation, remember?

110
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:46,240
Ah, I think I might just lie down after the show with a box of chocolates in today's crossword.

111
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,639
Or maybe I'll memorize another shopping list this time in Japanese.

112
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,519
Okay.

113
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,680
I think it's time to hear the answer to today's quiz question.

114
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,919
I asked how many neurons are there in a typical human brain?

115
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,799
Is it A, 8.6 billion, B, 86 billion,

116
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,079
or C, 860 billion?

117
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,720
And I said A, 8.6 billion.

118
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,960
I thought you were feeling clever today, Neil.

119
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,840
I'm afraid that's the wrong answer.

120
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,480
It's B, 86 billion.

121
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,680
But do you know how scientists calculated that number?

122
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,519
Um, did they have a guess?

123
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,319
Sophie.

124
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,759
No, not exactly.

125
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,759
Apparently, the easiest way is to count how many neurons that are in one part of the brain,

126
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,879
and then multiply that for the rest of the brain's volume.

127
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:35,680
Wow.

128
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,360
That's a lot of brain cells.

129
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,920
Okay, can we hear the words we learned today?

130
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:50,719
They are bilingualism, brain training, neurons, stroke, executive functions, switches,

131
00:05:51,839 --> 00:06:00,719
resist, enhance, cognitive reserve, stimulate, put someone's mind at rest.

132
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,600
Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

133
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,000
Don't forget to join us again soon.

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,960
Bye bye now.

135
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,920
Sayonara.

136
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,800
Ciao.

137
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,680
Hasta luego.
