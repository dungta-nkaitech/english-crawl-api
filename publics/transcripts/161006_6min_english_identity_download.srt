00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,200
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Alice.

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,879
And I'm Neil, so Alice, what do you see when you look at me?

4
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:25,839
Oh well, um, male. Caucasian, early 40s, short, urban hair,

5
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:27,839
bushye eyebrows, thin lips.

6
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,399
Ah, okay. So that's how you see me.

7
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,719
It sounds like a police report, I'm not sure I like your observation about thin lips.

8
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,320
Caucasian means white, skinned and European, by the way.

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,760
Mmm, and today, this show is about identity, who or what a person is.

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,600
And the way people see us forms part of our sense of identity,

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,600
while another part comes from our ethnic or racial identity.

12
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,560
So my question for you today, Neil, is what percentage of the UK population

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,679
describe themselves as ethnically mixed?

14
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,880
Is it a 0.9%?

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,040
B 5.9% or C 9%?

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,240
Okay, I think that it's a 0.9%.

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,640
Hmm, well, we'll find out if you got the answer right or wrong later on in the show.

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,359
Now, Neil, you are, of course, many more things than my physical description of you.

19
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,640
I'm glad to hear that.

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,000
And it's true that until you actually hear somebody speak,

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,079
there are lots of things you can't know about them.

22
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,280
For example, which country they're from, what language they speak.

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,280
Hmm, yes. So, looking at me, what would you say, Neil?

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,159
I would say, Alas, that you're a typical English rose.

25
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,840
Oh, thanks, Neil.

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,560
And English rose describes an attractive girl with a pale, delicate complexion,

27
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,840
or skin colour.

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,200
But you can't actually tell where a person is from, by the way, they look.

29
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,799
Yes, I suppose you're right.

30
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,760
I have a friend who also looks very English like you,

31
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,520
but she's a real ethnic mix.

32
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,920
Her dad's German and her mum's Brazilian.

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,600
Well, let's hear from New York City Actress and Playwright Sarah Jones

34
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,079
talking about her complicated ethnicity.

35
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,439
My family, on my dad's side, my grandparents are from the south.

36
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,199
There's some Caribbean in there, Black Americans from the south and the Caribbean.

37
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,120
And then on my mother's side, there are people from the Caribbean,

38
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,280
from Ireland, but, you know, Irish American, German American.

39
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,719
People would ask me if I was adopted when they saw my mother's white skin.

40
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,640
She's actually mixed, but she's white from a distance.

41
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,000
And I'm Black from a distance.

42
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,920
Sarah Jones there. Well, Sarah has family from all over the world.

43
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,560
I suppose the United States and New York City, especially, is a real melting pot.

44
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,520
That's right. And melting pot describes a society made from people of different countries

45
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,719
who live together and create a new shared culture.

46
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,920
And people think Sarah is adopted or raised by parents who aren't biologically hers,

47
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,080
because she looks so different to her mum.

48
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,439
But I expect Sarah sees herself as American. New York is where she was born and raised.

49
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:06,080
That's right, but her grandparents weren't.

50
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,480
Do you think you'd change when you go and live in another country with people different to you?

51
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,879
Yes, I do. My name is a Turkish, but they've lived in England for 45 years,

52
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,359
so they've integrated into our culture.

53
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:21,120
They enjoy English things like our TV soap operas,

54
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,000
cooking turkey at Christmas and drinking tea with milk.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,039
And to integrate means to join a group of people and often involves changing your habits and

56
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:36,560
customs. Yes, okay. So, Neil, to what extent does the way other people see us actually change us?

57
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's listen to Julian Bajini, a writer and philosopher here in the UK, and find out what he thinks.

58
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:49,280
It seems very evident that our sense of self isn't something that comes entirely from within.

59
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,960
And of course, we're affected by the way other people see us.

60
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,800
And that's one of the most formative things in creating our sense of identity.

61
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,199
I mean, I think it's kind of a two-way process that's ongoing.

62
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,719
In our sense of who we are, is always a response in part to how other people see us.

63
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:15,680
So, Julian Bajini believes the way other people see us is formative in creating our sense of identity or who we are.

64
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,279
And formative means important for the development of something.

65
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:25,519
Hmm, so if enough people see you as an English rose, you might start to see yourself as an English rose,

66
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,680
even if you aren't ethnically English.

67
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,199
I'm not so sure. The friend I talked about earlier, she comes across as much more Brazilian than English

68
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:36,879
in the way she behaves. She doesn't have the famous English reserve,

69
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,120
but you never know it by looking at her.

70
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,399
And reserve means hiding what you're thinking or feeling.

71
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,439
I think I'm guilty of English reserve. How about you, Neil?

72
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,480
No, I think I wear my heart on my sleeve, Alice, which means I make my feelings clear.

73
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,759
Okay, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question.

74
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,399
Oh, good. Fair enough. I asked you what percentage of the UK population

75
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:03,359
described themselves as ethnically mixed. Is it A0.9%

76
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:07,919
B5.9% or C9%

77
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,359
And I said A0.9%

78
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:14,639
Yes, and you were on the money today, Neil. Well done.

79
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,279
Where are you?

80
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,279
According to a survey conducted by the BBC in 2011,

81
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,759
when asked about their own ethnic origins,

82
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,839
0.9% of the UK population said they were mixed race.

83
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,679
Although it's thought that the real figure is 2% or more.

84
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:32,560
Now, could you remind us of the words we heard today, Neil?

85
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:41,199
Sure, they are Caucasian, identity, ethnic, English rose,

86
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:48,719
complexion, melting pot, adopted, integrate,

87
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:54,639
formative, reserve, wear your heart on your sleeve.

88
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,039
And that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.
