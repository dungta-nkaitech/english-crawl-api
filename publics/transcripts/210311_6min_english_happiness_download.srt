00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,440
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,039
And I'm Georgina.

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,800
That's a big smile on your face, Georgina. You seem happy today.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,679
I am Neil. After all, what's the point in seeing the glass half empty?

8
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:31,600
Ah, so you're someone who tries to see the glass half full.

9
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,640
You generally look at things in a positive way.

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,640
I hope so. It may seem strange to be discussing happiness in the middle of a global pandemic,

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,399
but right now, feeling happy is more important than ever.

12
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,799
Well, then, it's lucky that happiness is the subject of this programme, Georgina.

13
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,159
And while many things seem to be out of our control just now,

14
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:55,600
there are small things we can do to feel better about life.

15
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,960
To feel less stressed and maybe even a little happier.

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,920
You're talking like a dain now, Georgina.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,480
Denmark and, in fact, all the Nordic countries are often listed as among the happiest places in the world.

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,640
You know what we make me happy, Neil?

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,359
Asking me a really good quiz question.

20
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:18,640
Okay, well, did you know that every year the UN publishes its global happiness survey,

21
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,200
revealing the happiest countries in the world?

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,120
It's based on factors like income, life expectancy and health.

23
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:32,000
The Nordic countries often come in the top 10, but which country was rated the happiest in 2020?

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,239
Was it A, Iceland, B, Denmark or C, Finland?

25
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:42,239
Well, Neil, Denmark is famous for bacon, and nothing makes me happier than a bacon sandwich.

26
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,639
So I'll say B, Denmark.

27
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:48,079
I like your thinking, Georgina. We'll find out the answer later,

28
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,119
but you're certainly right to say that Denmark is considered one of the happiest countries in the world.

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,359
Malena Rydal, author of the best-selling book, Happy as a Dane, believes that aspects of Danish culture

30
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:02,400
can help us improve our chances of happiness.

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,319
Here she is explaining what happiness means for her to BBC World Service programme, the conversation.

32
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,920
See if you can hear what she thinks.

33
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,000
Well, I think we should be seeking alignment, and I think we should practice gratitude,

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,879
and I think we should be more conscious about how we relate to things that happen to us,

35
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,799
and how much we compare ourselves to others.

36
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,919
I do think that what we need to focus on is the quality of our relationships.

37
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,280
Did you hear Malena use the word alignment?

38
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,079
She thinks there should be harmony between my true sense of who I am,

39
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:38,479
what I think and how I relate to others.

40
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,359
We should be in alignment, or in the correct relation to those things.

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,000
Malena also thinks happiness comes from gratitude, feeling grateful and expressing thanks to other people.

42
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,759
She recommends finding three things, no matter how small to be grateful for every day.

43
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:01,039
Like getting a good night's sleep, drinking a hot coffee, and having this chat with you, Georgina.

44
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:03,919
Thanks, Neil, that's put a smile on my face.

45
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,960
It may sound strange, but doing this every day can really boost your happiness levels.

46
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,120
Malena also warns against seeking happiness in external things, as you can hear in this chat with

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,360
BBC World Services, the conversation.

48
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,320
If you seek happiness and you mistake it for pleasure, you will be running around like a little hamster

49
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,880
in your wheel, because it's never enough.

50
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,120
Because you will be very quickly the victim of the head and neck threat meal.

51
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,160
And the head only threat meal is, you know, you want something.

52
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,080
You think if you're more beautiful, if you get more power, if you get more money,

53
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,840
and fame, and then you'll finally be happy.

54
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,800
And then you get it and you get like a small satisfaction.

55
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,640
According to Malena, chasing external pleasures like money and fame will leave you feeling

56
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,560
like a hamster on a wheel, like someone who's always busy, but never accomplishes anything useful

57
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,400
or finishes what they start.

58
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,400
She also says it's easy to become a victim of the head onic treadmill.

59
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,760
This is the idea that humans adapt to whatever level of happiness they achieve.

60
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,480
As we make more money, meet the perfect boyfriend, or whatever we desire, our expectations also

61
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,159
increase. So we never find the happiness we hoped we would.

62
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,079
Money can't buy happiness, as my grandma used to say.

63
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,159
Right. In fact, it's probably the quality of our relationships, not external objects,

64
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:33,920
that gives satisfaction. The pleasure we feel when we achieve something we wanted to do.

65
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,759
Lots of useful tips there, Georgina, for feeling as happy as a dain.

66
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,199
A dain you say, Neil? So I got the correct answer?

67
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,199
In my quiz question, I asked Georgina which Nordic country was rated happiest in the UN's 2020

68
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:53,680
global survey? I guessed B, Denmark. But in fact, Georgina, it was C, Finland.

69
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,639
I guess their bacon sandwiches are even better.

70
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,399
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary and start seeing the glass half full, looking at things in a

71
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:08,800
positive way. Happiness might be all about alignment, being in the correct relation to things.

72
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,840
All gratitude, being grateful and giving thanks.

73
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,720
Feeling like a hamster on a wheel means you're always busy doing things, but without

74
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,520
getting satisfaction. The pleasant feeling of achieving something you really wanted to.

75
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,199
Finally, the reason happiness often escapes us may involve the hedonic treadmill,

76
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:33,040
the human tendency to return to the same level of happiness after something very good or very

77
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,920
bad has happened. That's all for this programme. We hope it's lifted your spirits and given you some

78
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,680
useful vocabulary as well. Remember to join us again soon for more interesting topics here at
