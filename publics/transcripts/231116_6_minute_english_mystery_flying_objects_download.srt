00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:11,200
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,200
I'm Neil.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,200
And I'm Beth.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,359
Now you might know them as aliens, UFOs, little green men or even UAPs.

6
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,240
UAP stands for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena.

7
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:32,399
And it's the word scientists now used to describe mysterious things not from this world.

8
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,359
So, Beth, how would you feel if you looked up and saw strange objects glowing and twisting

9
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:39,759
through the sky?

10
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:40,759
Wow.

11
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:43,039
Well, I might stare for a bit.

12
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,079
I don't know if I'd believe what I was seeing.

13
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,439
And I guess I'd be a bit scared.

14
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:54,280
Well, that situation is exactly what Navy pilots caught on their fighter jet cameras

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,880
on a training flight in 2004.

16
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:03,439
They recorded mysterious, oval objects flying at 24,000 metres.

17
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:09,599
The footage is known as the Tick-Tack videos and they have had millions of views on YouTube.

18
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:15,400
Now these videos are being reviewed by US Congress to try to understand what these objects

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
were.

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,280
Were they flying sources?

21
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,799
The disc-shaped craft flown by aliens?

22
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:24,759
Before, is there a more rational explanation?

23
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:29,519
In this programme, we'll be discussing whether we are alone in the universe.

24
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,280
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

25
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,679
But first I have a question for you, Beth.

26
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:42,519
Thousands of UFO sightings are recorded every year, but which country has had the highest

27
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:48,719
number of reported sightings since records began, according to the National UFO Reporting

28
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,039
Centre?

29
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,560
Is it A, the USA, B, Canada or C, China?

30
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,719
Hmm, I think it must be the USA.

31
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,280
Okay, Beth, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

32
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,640
Now while astronomers are scientists who study questions concerning things outside of

33
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,480
Earth, they often avoid investigating supposed aliens.

34
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,840
Adam Frank, professor of astrophysics at the University of Rochester, explains why the

35
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:25,240
footage in the Tic-Tac videos can't give any definitive answers of alien life to BBC

36
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,680
World Service programme, the inquiry.

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,520
I don't think the pilots are lying.

38
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,120
You know, I think the pilots are being honest and have a lot of integrity about what they

39
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,159
say they're seeing.

40
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,719
They're not saying they're aliens.

41
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,599
They're saying they behaved in ways that no jet could behave.

42
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:45,599
But you know, again, personal testimony, you can't do any science with that.

43
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,759
So what may happen now is we're going to begin to get us some scientific study of this

44
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:52,519
and we'll try and get a better handle on it.

45
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:58,719
Adam says the pilots have integrity and now meaning to have honesty and moral principles.

46
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:03,199
However, what they saw is based on personal testimony.

47
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:09,519
A personal testimony is a story or statement of evidence supported only by a person and

48
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,400
what they saw, rather than any external evidence or hard facts.

49
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,760
To find out more about exactly what the pilots saw, scientific studies are being carried

50
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,480
out to try and get a better handle on the situation.

51
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,879
If you get a handle on something, you understand it and are then able to deal with it.

52
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,840
Taking a more scientific approach to what the pilots saw, the Tic-Tac videos were examined

53
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,960
by a panel put together by NASA.

54
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:43,159
Here's Adam again discussing the findings on BBC World Service programme, the inquiry.

55
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:49,879
At the NASA panel, one of the scientists showed a simple analysis of the video that shows

56
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:54,719
the object traveling seemingly at high speed over the ocean.

57
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,240
And what the NASA scientist showed was that with a simple analysis, you could show that

58
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,680
that was moving at 40 miles an hour.

59
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,479
So certainly nothing very extra terrestrial about that.

60
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,240
The scientists found that although it looks like the object was traveling very fast, it

61
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:16,600
was only moving at 40 miles an hour, which Adam says is not very extra terrestrial.

62
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:23,480
Extra terrestrial means from outside earth and is another word often used to describe aliens.

63
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:29,400
So it seems that for now, scientists will need to find much more proof to know exactly

64
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,280
whether we're alone in the universe or not.

65
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,560
OK, Beth, I think it's time I revealed the answer to my question.

66
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,280
I asked you which country has had the highest number of reported sightings since records

67
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,600
began according to the National UFO Reporting Centre.

68
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,399
And I guessed the USA.

69
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,600
Which was.

70
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,439
The correct answer.

71
00:04:51,439 --> 00:05:00,040
There have been over 100,000 reported sightings and encounters with UFOs in the USA since 1947.

72
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,720
OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this programme, starting with UAP,

73
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:12,400
an acronym that stands for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena and is another word meaning

74
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,240
Alien or UFO.

75
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,200
A flying saucer is a disc-shaped craft supposedly flown by aliens.

76
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Integrity means being honest in what you say and having moral principles.

77
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,000
A personal testimony is a story or statement of evidence supported by a person and what

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,440
they saw rather than external evidence or hard facts.

79
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:40,480
If you get a handle on something, you understand it and are able to deal with it.

80
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:46,319
And finally, extra-terrestrial means from outside Earth and is another word often used to describe

81
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,319
aliens.

82
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,560
Once again, our six minutes are up.
