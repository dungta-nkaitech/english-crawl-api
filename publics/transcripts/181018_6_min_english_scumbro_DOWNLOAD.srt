From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,559
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Catherine.

6
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:17,640
And hello, I'm Rob.

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,160
Now Rob, do you ever buy things at a charity shop?

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,280
Yes, I do. They are a great place to pick up a bargain.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,960
And I also donate items to charity shops too.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,839
And a charity shop, by the way, is a shop where people

11
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,039
take their unwanted items and then the shop sells them

12
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:36,359
and makes money and the money goes to charity.

13
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:40,160
Exactly, that's good to hear Rob because donating,

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,480
that's giving money or goods to an organisation,

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,640
helps charities raise money.

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,799
And you might be interested to know that dressing up

17
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:50,920
in second-hand clothes is back in fashion.

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,200
Well, sort of.

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,799
And that's what we're discussing today.

20
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:58,599
Is looking like you're dressing in charity shop clothes

21
00:00:58,599 --> 00:01:00,519
a new fashion statement?

22
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,399
It should be interesting, but first Catherine,

23
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,879
aren't you going to set me a question to answer?

24
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,799
And not a second-hand one, please.

25
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:09,959
It's a brand new question today, Rob.

26
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,879
For you and the listeners at home,

27
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:16,599
do you know when the first official charity shop opened its doors

28
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,120
in the UK?

29
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:24,599
Was it in A1928, B1948 or C1948?

30
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,599
I'll go for 1948.

31
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:31,920
OK, and we'll find out the answer later.

32
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,920
But now back to our discussion about charity shops and fashion.

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,000
And there's a new look-in-town

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,879
which some people are calling Scumbro.

35
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:44,799
Scumbro combines the word scummy,

36
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,920
which means dirty and messy,

37
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,759
with the word bro,

38
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:53,319
which is an informal way of referring to a boy or a man.

39
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:56,359
So Scumbro is a fashion for men,

40
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:58,399
but women can't adopt it too.

41
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,119
It's a bit of insulting name,

42
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,119
and here's the odd thing about this new fashion style.

43
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,079
Being Scumbro is about buying expensive designer brands

44
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,120
that look like they're from a charity shop, very odd.

45
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,680
Well, it's something Amber Graffland knows about.

46
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,840
She's the fashion and beauty director

47
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,959
for the Daily Mirror newspaper,

48
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:21,039
and she's been telling BBC Radio 4's

49
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,759
you and yours programme all about it.

50
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,199
So how did this trend start?

51
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:29,759
Well, I think the name came from a vanity fair article,

52
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,439
and I think Justin Bieber,

53
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,000
the likes of Jonah Hill, to thank for this look.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,439
Pete Davidson, who's actually the fiance of Ariana Grande,

55
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,879
he's definitely one of the founding fathers of Scumbro.

56
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,919
And I think like most of these trends,

57
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,599
they're started by celebrities,

58
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:47,359
and then they, I mean, look, it's been picked up by everybody

59
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:48,519
by the sounds of them.

60
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Okay, so the fashion magazine vanity fair invented the name,

61
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,160
but the trend has spread because celebrities

62
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,920
have been dressing in this style.

63
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,879
Yes, and Amber mentioned a number of celebrities

64
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,760
who are the founding fathers of the trend.

65
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,160
That's a term used to describe people

66
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,280
who start an idea or an organisation.

67
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,280
Yes, the trend has been picked up or copied by people

68
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,920
who you might describe as fashion victims,

69
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,000
people who have to follow the latest fashion trends.

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,439
Well, Rob, I'm no fashion victim,

71
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,479
but I say maybe one day I might want to look Scumbro,

72
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:25,560
or maybe Scumsis.

73
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,960
So how exactly should I dress?

74
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,639
Okay, well, let's hear from Amber Graffland again.

75
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,159
How does she describe the characteristics of this fashion trend?

76
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:38,680
It's all about Rayne's oversized clothes that are overpriced,

77
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,840
and I think it's not just about looking like you've rummaged

78
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,639
in a teenager's dressing up box.

79
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,479
These are very, very expensive items.

80
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,319
You mentioned the label's Prada Fasachi,

81
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,599
Gucci Supreme.

82
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,239
While it's basically about looking simultaneously

83
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:52,840
like you've made no effort,

84
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,879
but the underlying thing is that you do need to see

85
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,599
that the effort has gone in there.

86
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,919
Well, this fashion trend does involve a lot of effort.

87
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,079
It's not just about looking messy,

88
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:05,039
like you've rummaged in a teenager's dressing up box.

89
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:07,400
rummaging is when you search for something that's mixed up

90
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,919
with lots of other things.

91
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,560
No, don't be rummaging.

92
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,680
The trick seems to be to look like you've not made any effort,

93
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,560
but at the same time, you're showing that you have made an effort,

94
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,160
and that's the meaning of the word simultaneously,

95
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,280
doing one thing at the same time as another thing.

96
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,680
And I guess by showing you've made an effort,

97
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,280
you wear designer labels, showing you've paid lots of money.

98
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,079
The issue here is clothes from charity shops

99
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,920
are supposed to be cheap.

100
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,800
Some people even buy these clothes

101
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,920
because it's all they can afford.

102
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,319
But the irony here is some people are choosing

103
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:46,040
to pay lots and lots of money

104
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,079
to look like they're wearing second-hand clothes.

105
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:53,279
And the charity shops aren't making any money from it.

106
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,920
Well, if you're a fashion victim,

107
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,000
it's something you have to do.

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,120
And there's one thing I have to do now,

109
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,519
and that's give you the answer to today's quiz question.

110
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,959
So I asked you earlier,

111
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:08,839
when the first official charity shop opened its doors in the UK.

112
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,279
And I said, 1948.

113
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:13,799
And you are correct this week, Rob Weldon.

114
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:17,319
The very first shop run by the charity Oxfam

115
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:20,759
opened its doors in Oxford in 1948

116
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,879
as a direct result of an appeal launched

117
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:26,159
to help post-war Greece.

118
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,559
Very interesting.

119
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:29,199
Right, well, let's remind ourselves

120
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,719
of some of today's vocabulary,

121
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:33,079
starting with the word donating,

122
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,799
which means giving goods or money

123
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:37,039
to an organisation or charity.

124
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,479
Then we mentioned Founding Fathers,

125
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,040
a term used to describe people who start an idea

126
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,879
or an organisation.

127
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,960
We also mentioned that Catherine was no fashion victim,

128
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,920
a person who has to follow the latest fashion trends.

129
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,160
Rummaging was a word that described searching for something

130
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,800
that's mixed up with lots of other things.

131
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,080
And then we had simultaneously,

132
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,960
which means doing one thing at the same time

133
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,680
as doing something else.

134
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,720
Well, you can simultaneously listen to this programme

135
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,879
and look at our website, if you like.

136
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,000
The web address is bbclearningenglish.com.

137
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,839
But that's all we have time for now.

138
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,360
Join us again next time.

139
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,759
Goodbye. Bye-bye.
