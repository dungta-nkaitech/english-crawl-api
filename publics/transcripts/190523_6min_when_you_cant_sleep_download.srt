5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,480
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,439
And I'm Rob.

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:16,480
He looked tired, Rob.

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,800
Well, I didn't sleep well last night.

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,879
I was tossing and turning all night,

10
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:22,480
but I couldn't get to sleep.

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,920
Well, that's a coincidence as our topic today is in Somnia.

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,920
The condition some people suffer from when they find it difficult to get to sleep

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,120
when they go to bed.

14
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,440
Thankfully, I don't really have in Somnia,

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,880
but every now and again, I find it difficult to get to sleep.

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,079
Well, keep listening and we might have some advice to help with that.

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,520
But first a question.

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,280
What is the record for the longest a human has gone without sleep?

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,359
Is it A about seven days, B about nine days,

20
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:51,600
or C about eleven days?

21
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,120
What do you think, Rob?

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,719
All of those seem impossible,

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,160
so I've got to go with a shortest about seven days.

24
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,319
Well, if you can stay awake long enough,

25
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:02,079
I'll let you know at the end of the program.

26
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,920
Dr. Michael Granner is an expert in all things to do with sleep.

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,159
He was interviewed recently on the BBC Radio Program Business Daily.

28
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,519
He was asked what his best tip was to help you get to sleep

29
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,039
if you are finding it difficult.

30
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:16,799
What was his suggestion?

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,599
And it sounds counterintuitive,

32
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,199
but trust me, I've got decades of data behind this statement.

33
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:25,199
If you cannot sleep, get out of bed.

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,159
So, Rob, how does he suggest you help yourself to get to sleep?

35
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,439
Oh, well, actually, he says that the best thing to do is to get out of bed.

36
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,680
That sounds exactly the opposite of what you should do, doesn't it?

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,439
Well, he does say that his advice is counterintuitive,

38
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,520
which means exactly that, that it is the opposite of what you might expect.

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,520
And he says that this advice is backed up by decades of research.

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,879
A decade is a period of ten years, and when we say decades,

41
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:58,479
it's a general term for many years, at least 20.

42
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,879
Let's hear that advice again from Dr. Granner.

43
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:03,039
And it sounds counterintuitive,

44
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:06,640
but trust me, I've got decades of data behind this statement.

45
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,560
If you cannot sleep, get out of bed.

46
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,560
So, why is getting out of bed good advice?

47
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,439
Here's the explanation from Dr. Granner.

48
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,840
When you're in bed and you're not asleep and you do that over and over and over again,

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,719
for extended periods of time, the ability of the bed to put you to sleep starts getting diluted.

50
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,400
Not only that, it starts getting replaced by thinking and tossing and turning and

51
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,840
worrying and doing all these things. When you're not asleep, you get out of bed.

52
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,520
This is probably one of the most effective ways to prevent chronic insomnia.

53
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,240
It's also one of the really effective ways to treat it.

54
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,159
It won't work 100% of the time, but it will actually work more than most people think.

55
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,439
We normally sleep in beds.

56
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:55,759
Beds are designed to make it easy to sleep, but if we can't sleep, that makes the bed's impact weaker.

57
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,400
As Dr. Granner says, it dilutes the power of the bed to help us sleep.

58
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,280
When you dilute something, you make it weaker.

59
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,240
For example, you can dilute the strength of a strong fruit juice by adding water to it.

60
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:14,479
So, if we stay in bed tossing and turning, which is the expression we use to describe moving around in the bed,

61
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,519
trying to get to sleep, we begin to think of the bed as a place where we don't sleep,

62
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,079
rather than as a place where we do sleep.

63
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,159
So, get out of bed to break the connection.

64
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,799
This, he says, is a positive way to approach chronic insomnia.

65
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,759
Chronic is an adjective that is used to describe conditions that are long-lasting.

66
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,120
So, we're not talking here about occasionally not being able to get to sleep,

67
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,839
but a condition where it happens every night.

68
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:41,679
Let's hear Dr. Granner again.

69
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,280
When you're in bed and you're not asleep and you do that over and over and over again,

70
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,159
for extended periods of time, the ability of the bed to put you to sleep starts getting diluted.

71
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,159
Not only that, it starts getting replaced by thinking and tossing and turning and worrying

72
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,120
and doing all these things.

73
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,280
When you're not asleep, you get out of bed.

74
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,960
This is probably one of the most effective ways to prevent chronic insomnia.

75
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,680
It's also one of the really effective ways to treat it.

76
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,600
It won't work 100% of the time.

77
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,599
But it will actually work more than most people think.

78
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,519
Time to review today's vocabulary, but first, let's have the answer to the quiz question.

79
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,680
What is the record for the longest a human has gone without sleep?

80
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,920
Is it A about seven days?

81
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,600
B about nine days?

82
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,360
C about eleven days?

83
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,040
What did you think, Rob?

84
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,519
I thought it must be about seven days.

85
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,240
Well, I'm afraid you're not right.

86
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,480
The answer, rather amazingly, is actually just over eleven days.

87
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:44,560
Extra bonus points for anyone who knew that that was done in 1964 by someone called Randy Gardner.

88
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,680
That's extraordinary.

89
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,840
It's difficult to imagine even going a couple of days without sleep, but eleven,

90
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,680
I wonder how long he slept for after that?

91
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,600
14 hours and 40 minutes.

92
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,120
You've got all the answers, haven't you?

93
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,680
Well, when I can't sleep, I get up and read trivia.

94
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,480
And now it's time for the vocabulary.

95
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,720
Today, our topic has been insomnia.

96
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,000
This is the word for the condition of not being able to sleep,

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,480
and something that people do when they are trying to sleep is toss and turn in bed.

98
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,879
The opposite of what seems logical or obvious is counterintuitive.

99
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,120
It goes against what you might expect, so if you can't sleep, get out of bed.

100
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,879
Our next word is diluted.

101
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,959
This is from the verb to dilute, which means to make something less strong.

102
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,600
And finally, there was the adjective chronic.

103
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,040
This is an expression for a medical condition that is long-lasting.

104
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,400
So someone who has chronic insomnia regularly has difficulty getting enough sleep.

105
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,120
It's not just something that happens now and again.

106
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,319
Well, we hope that six minute English isn't a cure for insomnia,

107
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,480
but I do find listening to podcasts and spoken radio helps me get to sleep.

108
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,040
Well, before we all drop off to sleep from the comforting tone of your voice, Rob,

109
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,480
it's time for us to say goodbye.

110
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,759
