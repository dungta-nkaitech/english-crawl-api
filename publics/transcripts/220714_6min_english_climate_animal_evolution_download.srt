00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,559
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Rob.

5
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:19,760
And I'm Sam.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,440
Now, when we think about famous figures in the history of science,

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,240
the name of Charles Darwin often comes up.

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,119
Darwin is most famous for his theory of evolution,

9
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,599
the idea that animals change and adapt in response to their environment.

10
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,560
In the 1830s, he visited the Galapagos, a string of islands in the Pacific Ocean,

11
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,439
famous because of the unique animals living there.

12
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:51,039
It was while in the Galapagos, observing small birds called finches,

13
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,399
that Darwin started forming his theory of evolution.

14
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,799
But today, the animals of the Galapagos face the same pressures as animals across the world

15
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,679
because of the effects of man-made climate change.

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:12,799
Warming sea waters and more frequent extreme weather events are affecting animals as much as humans.

17
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,239
So in this programme, we'll be asking, can animals evolve to deal with climate change?

18
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,920
But first, I have a question for you, Sam.

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,480
And it's about Charles Darwin's trip to the Galapagos.

20
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,280
In 1831, Darwin set sail around the world, collecting samples of flora and fauna,

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,640
the plants and animals of the places he visited.

22
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,359
But what was the name of the ship he sailed in?

23
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,640
Was it A, HMS Beagle, B, HMS Victory, or C, SS Great Britain?

24
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,320
Maybe it was B, HMS Victory.

25
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:49,680
Are you sure?

26
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,480
No.

27
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,600
Well, I'll reveal the correct answer later in the programme.

28
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,280
Now, it may have been the Galapagos Finches that started Charles Darwin thinking

29
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,240
about how animals adapt to their environment.

30
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,640
But as naturalist Kiyoko Gotanda explained to BBC World Service Programme the Climate Question,

31
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,319
Darwin's first impression of the small birds wasn't very good.

32
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,719
When Darwin got to the Galapagos Islands, he actually wasn't that interested in the finches.

33
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,000
They were kind of a drab colour and they didn't have a very interesting song.

34
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,919
He sampled, though, for the finches from different islands.

35
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,800
And so when he got back to England and he was looking at all the variation in beak shape and size

36
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,919
and body size and shape and he was recalling how certain finches were found on certain islands,

37
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,759
but not on other islands.

38
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,360
In contrast to more colourful birds like Galapagos parrots,

39
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,040
the finches Darwin observed would drab dull and boring looking with little colour.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,280
Instead, what Darwin noticed were variations in the finches beak, the hard pointed part of a bird's

41
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,080
mouth. Finches born with a beak that could help them get more food were more likely to survive

42
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,440
and have babies. Over time, as the birds passed on their successful genes,

43
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,079
they adapted to fit in with their environment, what we know as evolution.

44
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,599
So if animals can evolve to survive their environment, can they also evolve to cope with the

45
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:28,079
impact humans are having on the climate? Well, there's already some evidence to show they can.

46
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:34,960
Studies on birds in the Brazilian Amazon and Red Deer on the Isle of Rum in Scotland show warmer

47
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:41,360
temperatures have caused animals to evolve smaller bodies. It's easier to keep cool when you're small.

48
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,760
American conservationist Thor Hanson records and measures and noly lizards in the Caribbean.

49
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,280
He wants to see how the effects of man-made climate change, in this case hurricanes,

50
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,120
is affecting the lizards. Listen to what Thor found out as he speaks with presenters of BBC World

51
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,759
Services, the climate question. But what you can see is that large two-pads and strong front

52
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,400
legs give some lizards a tighter grip. When they do start to let go and their body starts

53
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,840
flapping in the air like a flag, smaller back legs reduce the drag and allow them to cling on

54
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,160
and survive the hurricane. So the survivors were those lizards with those characteristics

55
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,280
and they passed those traits along to their offspring.

56
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,880
Thor's lizards develop stronger front legs and smaller back legs, allowing them to cling on,

57
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,879
hold on to something tightly when hurricanes pass through. It's this trait, a genetically

58
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:44,960
determined characteristic that allows the lizards to survive and is passed on to their babies.

59
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,120
Thor checked other areas of the Caribbean where hurricanes were frequent and found the same

60
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:58,000
traits in lizards there. Proof of evolution in action. But whereas we often think of evolution

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,079
happening over hundreds, even thousands of years, the changes in the Caribbean lizards happened

62
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:10,319
in around 40 years, something that would have surprised Charles Darwin. Richard reminds me of your

63
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:17,439
question, Rob. Ah yes, I asked you the name of the ship. Darwin sailed around the world in.

64
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,600
Darwin ship was called the HMS Beagle and appropriately enough, it was named after an animal,

65
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,399
a beagle is a type of dog. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from this program about evolution,

66
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:36,079
the way living things adapt to their environment and pass these adaptations onto their children.

67
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,839
Flora and Fauna is another way of saying the plants and animals are the place.

68
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:50,319
Drab means dull and colourless in appearance. A bird's beak is the hard pointed part of its mouth.

69
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:58,399
To cling on means to hold on very tightly. And finally, a trait is a genetically determined

70
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:05,439
characteristic. Once again, our six minutes are up. Join us again soon for more interesting topics
