00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,439
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:16,960
Hello, I'm Catherine.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,960
And if I say to you, Catherine, Fortnite, what do you think of?

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,400
Well, that's easy, Neil. A Fortnite is a period of two weeks.

8
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:33,039
Well, Fortnite, spelt F-O-R-T-N-I-G-H-T, is indeed a period of two weeks.

9
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:40,959
But Fortnite, spelt F-O-R-T-N-I-T-E, is an online computer game that has become

10
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:44,480
incredibly popular in a very short period of time.

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,399
As well as popular, it's also very competitive.

12
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,840
And you're soon going to be able to make big money playing it,

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,920
and you can even hire people to be your Fortnite coach.

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,640
Well, before we hear a little more about this topic, it's time for our quiz.

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,480
These days, we play computer games on our phones.

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,480
We can hold them in our hands.

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:11,680
In 1950, Bertie the Brain was the name of one of the very first computer games.

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,760
It played a simple game of knots and crosses, also called Tic-Tac-Toe.

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,640
But how tall was this computer?

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,560
Was it A, 1 meter tall?

21
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:23,600
B, about 4 meters tall?

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,480
Or C, about 10 meters tall?

23
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,600
Well, if it was a 1950s, computers were huge.

24
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,240
So I'm going to go for 10 meters.

25
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,520
Okay, well, we'll find out if you're right at the end of the program.

26
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,079
Esports or computer games competitions are now a thing.

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,439
In some markets, they are huge and they are even discussing including them in the Olympic games.

28
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,879
Kyle Jackson is a 13 year old gamer who's been asked to join a team.

29
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,679
How long does he say he's been playing video games?

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,039
Play video games all my life, basically.

31
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:02,719
I started playing competitively when I was around 9 or 10.

32
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,120
I got into Halo, Call of Duty, games like that.

33
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:13,919
And I just, I realised that I could probably go to a pro level if I keep playing at the level I am.

34
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,639
He said that he's been playing computer games all his life.

35
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,599
Now that might be a little exaggeration,

36
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,879
but he's probably been playing them ever since he can remember.

37
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,959
When he was 9 or 10, he started playing competitively,

38
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,959
which means he started playing in competitions against other people.

39
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,560
He talks about a number of games that he got into.

40
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,919
This is a good expression.

41
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,199
If you're into something, you are very interested in it.

42
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,719
And to get into something,

43
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,719
describes the process of becoming interested in that thing.

44
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,280
In Kyle's case, it was computer games,

45
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,759
and he got so good that he's thinking about playing at a professional level.

46
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,759
Doing something as a professional means that it's more than a hobby or pastime.

47
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,000
It's something someone pays you to do because you're really good at it.

48
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:10,879
George Yao is a former gaming champion who is now director of media of team secret.

49
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,759
Team secret are like a regular sports team.

50
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:18,240
They have a group of players who play matches and competitions against other teams,

51
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,639
except these are not regular sports.

52
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,000
These are e-sports and they are big business.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,960
Here's George Yao.

54
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,919
It's becoming a multi-billion dollar industry.

55
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,519
Just games, production of games, publishing of games, and the esports scene.

56
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,439
So it's not just one thing now.

57
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,039
It's a whole industry.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,599
So George Yao says that online gaming is becoming a multi-billion dollar industry.

59
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,560
We usually think of industry as factories and manufacturing,

60
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,519
but it can also apply to other areas as well

61
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,399
that involve a lot of different elements that come together to make a business.

62
00:03:56,399 --> 00:04:00,959
Different elements that he mentions as part of this industry are creating games,

63
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,919
publishing games, and the esports scene.

64
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,039
The word scene here refers to the world of esports,

65
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,679
the events, the competitions, and the players,

66
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:12,159
and many people want to be part of that scene.

67
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:15,679
Right now, let's get the answer to our quiz question

68
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:19,039
about the size of that 1950s computer game.

69
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:24,159
Was it A, one meter tall, B, four meters tall, or C, 10 meters tall?

70
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:25,199
What did you say, Catherine?

71
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,719
I went for 10 meters, Neil.

72
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:29,759
Well, unfortunately, it was four meters.

73
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,279
Still quite big, though. Imagine you couldn't get one of those in your pocket.

74
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,039
Rather not.

75
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:37,679
But I would like to review today's vocabulary.

76
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:42,559
We started off with the word for a period of two weeks, a fortnight.

77
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:44,319
But with a different spelling,

78
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,919
fortnight is also a very popular video game.

79
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,399
Multi-player video game competitions,

80
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,159
which people pay to go and watch are known as esports.

81
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:57,759
Playing against other people is playing competitively.

82
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,039
Do you like to play multi-player video games, Catherine?

83
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,160
I've never really got into them, even though I've tried one or two.

84
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,960
And that was one of our other expressions to get into something,

85
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,520
to become really interested in something.

86
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,600
Same here. I enjoy playing a little bit,

87
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,520
but I could never be a professional.

88
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,520
I couldn't get paid to do it as a job.

89
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,879
Of course not. You're already a professional, broadcaster, Neil.

90
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,720
An area of business that's made up of different parts

91
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
can be described as an industry.

92
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,600
The video game industry is a multi-billion dollar business.

93
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,160
And we also talk about, for example,

94
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,360
the fashion industry and the movie industry.

95
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,840
And finally, there was the word scene.

96
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,320
This noun is used to describe the world of a particular activity.

97
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,520
So the esport scene, for example, is the world of esports.

98
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,360
The games, the teams, the competition, the audiences,

99
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,000
it's all part of this scene.

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,360
Well, that's all from the six-minute English scene today.
