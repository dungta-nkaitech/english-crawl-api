Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,039
And I'm Sam. Tell me, Sam, do you think Neil Armstrong really landed on the moon in 1969?

4
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,679
I mean, that must be fake news. And who shot John F Kennedy? Surely the CIA were involved,

5
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,320
unless it was the giant lizards controlling the government?

6
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:40,879
Oh dear, it looks like reading online conspiracies has sent Neil down the rabbit hole.

7
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:48,320
An expression used to describe a situation which seems interesting and uncomplicated at first,

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,120
but ends up becoming strange, confusing, and hard to escape from.

9
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:59,039
Luckily, in this programme, we'll be hearing some advice on how to talk to people who've become

10
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,599
convinced by online conspiracies. It seems that during times of crisis, as people feel uncertain

11
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,000
and fearful, they actively look for information to feel more secure.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,319
Nowadays, this information is often found online. And while there are reliable facts out there,

13
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,039
there's also a lot of misinformation.

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,480
Somebody who's the target of many conspiracy theories is Microsoft's Bill Gates.

15
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:31,680
And our BBC fact checkers have been busy debunking or exposing some of the more bizarre accusations

16
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,880
made against him. But what strange behaviour has Bill Gates been accused of recently?

17
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,960
That's my quiz question for today. Is it A being a member of the Chinese Communist Party?

18
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:50,639
B being an alien lizard? Or C being involved in the assassination of John F Kennedy?

19
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:55,919
They all sound pretty silly to me, but I guess B being an alien lizard.

20
00:01:56,559 --> 00:02:00,319
Okay, Sam, if you say so, we'll find out the answer later.

21
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,079
Now, I'm not the only one who's been doing some internet research.

22
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,599
Ever since the outbreak of the Covid pandemic, there's been an avalanche of online conspiracies

23
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,359
linking Bill Gates to the coronavirus. Here's Mariana Spring, presenter of BBC World Service

24
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:17,519
Programme Trending, to tell us more.

25
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:23,840
The Microsoft founder is a rich and powerful person and he's funded research into vaccines.

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,120
That's why he's become a target. Some of the claims are bonkers. That he wants to use the virus as

27
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,479
a pretext to microchip everyone in the world. Others say a vaccine would actually kill people

28
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:39,439
rather than save their lives. These ideas are without any evidence. We should treat them with

29
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:46,479
the disdain they deserve. Some conspiracies claim that Bill Gates wants to implant microchips in

30
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:53,199
people and that he's using the coronavirus as a pretext, a pretend reason for doing something

31
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:59,439
that is used to hide the real reason. Claims like these are described as bonkers

32
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,479
an informal way to say silly, stupid or crazy and should therefore be treated with

33
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,479
disdain, disliking something because you feel it does not deserve your attention or respect.

34
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:16,719
But while you might not believe such bonkers theories yourself, it's not hard to see how people

35
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:21,679
looking for answers can get sucked down online rabbit holes.

36
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,199
So how would you deal with someone spreading baseless conspiracies about Covid vaccines or Bill Gates?

37
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,959
The BBC's trending programs spoke to Dr. Yovon Biford,

38
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,719
senior psychology lecturer with the Open University about it.

39
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:44,399
He thinks it's important to separate the conspiracy from the theorist. The former, the belief,

40
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:49,839
we have to dismiss. But the latter, the person, is more complex.

41
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,919
Here's BBC Trending's presenter, Mariana Spring, again to sum up Dr. Biford's advice.

42
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,799
How do you talk to someone who's at risk of being sucked into the rabbit hole?

43
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,639
First, establish a basis of understanding. Approach them on their own terms and avoid sweeping

44
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:12,239
dismissals or saying, you're wrong. Try not to judge and try to get to the bottom of the often

45
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,639
legitimate concern at the heart of the conspiracy. Present them with facts and research. Try to do this

46
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,000
neutrally. You can't force anyone to change their mind, but you can make sure they have valid

47
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:30,879
information. While some conspiracies may be harmless, others are more dangerous.

48
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,639
People thinking that vaccines will kill them might worsen the coronavirus situation worldwide,

49
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,120
so we need to get to the bottom of these claims. Discover the real, but sometimes hidden reason,

50
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,120
why something happens. A good way to engage people in discussion is to avoid sweeping claims or

51
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,160
statements, speaking or writing about things in a way that is too general and does not carefully

52
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:01,120
consider all the relevant facts. And by doing so calmly and neutrally, you might persuade them to

53
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,920
reconsider, the funny business Bill Gates is supposedly involved with. Ah, yes, you mean our quiz

54
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,879
question. I asked you what Bill Gates has recently been accused of by conspiracy theorists.

55
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,000
And I said B being an alien lizard, but thinking about it now, that seems pretty unlikely.

56
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,639
In fact, the answer was A being a member of the Chinese Communist Party.

57
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:30,639
Okay, so today we've been hearing advice on how to deal with online conspiracy theories.

58
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:38,319
Some of which are totally bonkers, silly, stupid and crazy, or involve a complicated pretext.

59
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,079
Pretend reason used to hide someone's true motivation.

60
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,759
These can be treated with disdain, dislike because they are unworthy of our attention or respect.

61
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,879
But with so many conspiracies online, it's easy to get lost down the rabbit hole, intrigued by

62
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,399
a situation which seems interesting, but ends up confusing and hard to escape from.

63
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:06,079
It's important to get to the bottom of these theories, discover the real, but hidden reason behind them.

64
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:12,800
And to present people with facts, avoiding sweeping or overgeneralized statements.

65
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,759
That's all for this programme. Goodbye for now. Bye bye.
