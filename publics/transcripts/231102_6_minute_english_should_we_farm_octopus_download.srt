2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,400
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,320
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,199
Beth, what do you think about when I say the word octopus?

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,199
Well, I know they're intelligent.

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,000
They can change colour to hide in their surroundings.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And of course, they have eight arms,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
but I have to admit, I also think about how they taste.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Delicious.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah, I think that too.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
As do plenty of other people.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Octopus is most commonly eaten in South Korea, Spain, Portugal and Japan,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
where they can't get enough of that umami flavour.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Umami is one of the five basic tastes and is a savoury flavour.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Until recently, octopus has only been caught in the wild.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But now, a Spanish multinational company has announced it will be ready to sell farmed octopus soon,

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
which campaigners have described as ethically and ecologically unjustified.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This is because octopuses are sentient.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
An adjective describing a thing that experiences feelings like pleasure and pain.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Humans and many other animals like pigs, monkeys and birds are also sentient.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So, is it okay to farm octopus when they have been shown to experience feelings?

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
In this programme, we'll be discussing whether farming octopus can ever be ethical.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But first, I have a question for you, Beth.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Octopuses are known for their ability to problem solve.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And when kept in tanks, have been known to escape.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But where did Inky the octopus go when he broke out of his tank at the New Zealand National Aquarium in 2016?

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Was it A, down a drain into the Pacific Ocean?

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
B, to the tank of a female octopus or C to the Aquarium Carp Hark.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hmm, I'll guess he went to the tank of a female octopus.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay, Beth, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
In many countries, it's not easy to find octopus in shops.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But if plans for farmed octopus go ahead, you're much more likely to see it in the supermarket.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Claire Marshall, who's been reporting on the octopus farm story since 2019,

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
explains why octopuses have not been farmed before, as she told BBC World Service programme The Food Chain.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
They've got an incredibly complex life cycle, and it's scientists have been sort of working feverishly to try to close that life cycle,

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
particularly in Mexico and Japan and obviously in Spain.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
They need life, food, the larvae, and also octopuses are incredibly solitary,

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and it just makes it really hard to manage to basically keep them in captivity at a commercial scale.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Octopuses are difficult to farm because they have a complex life cycle.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The series of changes an animal goes through, starting with birth and ending with death.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Unlike traditional farmed animals like chickens and pigs who are social animals and can be kept together,

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
octopuses are solitary, meaning they like to live alone.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This makes keeping them in captivity very difficult because of space.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If an animal lives in captivity, it's kept somewhere and not allowed to leave,

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
even if it wants to, like in a zoo.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But it's not only space that is a problem when it comes to farming octopuses,

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
it's their capacity to feel emotions as well.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Scientific researcher Dr Heather Browning has been studying the sentience of octopuses

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
for a British Government Commissioned report.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
She shared the report findings with Ruth Alexander, presenter of BBC Radio Full Program, The Food Chain.

52
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Sorry, we wanted to look at whether they had specific kinds of nerve connections,

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
or they had specific kinds of brains, and whether they were capable of performing certain kinds of trade-off behaviors,

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
or pain-related behaviors, learning behaviors, that we thought would correlate with the probability of sentience.

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And what we found for octopuses in particular is they seemed to me many of the criteria that we laid out.

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The scientists found that octopuses do experience feelings,

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
because they show typical characteristics of sentient creatures, such as trade-off behavior.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Trade-off means giving up one thing in return for another,

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
such as giving up shelter for food.

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
So it looks like the debate about whether it's okay to farm and eat octopuses will continue.

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Okay, Beth, I think it's time I revealed the answer to my question.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I asked you where Inky the Octopus went when he escaped his tank at the New Zealand National Aquarium.

63
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
And I said it was to the tank of a female octopus.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Well, that was the wrong answer I'm afraid.

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
In fact, Inky the Octopus was trying to reach the tank of a female,

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
but he found a drain instead, which led straight to the Pacific Ocean.

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this program, starting with Umami.

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The flavor octopus has, which can be described as savory, and is one of the five basic tastes.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If something is sentient, it experiences feelings, such as joy and pain.

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Life cycle is the series of changes something goes through from birth to death.

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If something is solitary, it likes to live alone.

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
In captivity means an animal is kept somewhere and is not allowed to leave.

73
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And finally, trade-off means to exchange one thing for another.

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Once again, our six minutes are up.

Join us again soon for more useful vocabulary here at six minutes English.

76
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Goodbye for now.

77
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Goodbye.
