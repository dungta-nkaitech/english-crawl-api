Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Sam and I'm Georgina.

3
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,879
Something that affects almost every woman at some point in her life is the menopause.

4
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,879
The menopause is a natural part of aging that happens as a woman's hormones decline and she

5
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:36,879
stops having monthly periods and being able to get pregnant naturally. With the menopause comes

6
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:43,920
physical signs. These vary from person to person and often include hot flushes, mood swings and

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,320
night sweats. But besides these, there may be other changes too and living through it can be isolating

8
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,480
both personally and professionally. In many societies the menopause is still taboo,

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,000
not talked about in public for social or religious reasons or because people are uncomfortable

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,439
discussing it. But recently high-profile women like former first lady Michelle Obama have started

11
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,039
speaking up. In this programme we'll be hearing from two other women trying to make the menopause

12
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,200
more visible in society. And of course we'll be learning some related vocabulary as well,

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,280
but first let me ask you my quiz question Georgina. As we mentioned the menopause is part of the

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:35,840
natural aging process and usually occurs between the ages of 45 and 55. But what is the average age

15
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:48,000
for a woman to reach the menopause in Britain? Is it A 49, B 51 or C 53? I'll jump in the middle and say 51

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,120
years old. Okay Georgina we'll find out the answer later in the programme. Since the menopause is a

17
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:01,520
normal and natural part of life it's surprising how little it's talked about. Dr Niggat Arif is a

18
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:07,759
British Pakistani family doctor specialising in women's health. According to her the silence

19
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:14,000
around the subject is because menopause is about getting old, something no one wants to be reminded of.

20
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,840
Here is Dr Arif explaining more to BBC World Service programme the conversation.

21
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,159
Historically particularly when it comes to women the older you are you're surplus to excess now.

22
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:31,280
That's it you've done your dues you've had your children your use isn't needed anymore in society.

23
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,960
But actually women are not like that at all women are far more the coming productive in the

24
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,719
career and workspace and they are the caregivers. Sometimes they are actually the financial

25
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:49,599
providers in their home setting as well. In many cultures the traditional role of women is to have

26
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:56,400
children. Dr Arif says that after doing this women may be considered to have done or paid their dues

27
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,760
an expression meaning to do everything you are expected to do or to have done your duty.

28
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,319
After raising children women are sometimes thought to be surplus to excess something which is

29
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:15,680
more than needed or in other words surplus to requirements a phrase meaning no longer required.

30
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,159
Of course this isn't true for all women everywhere but it is surprising how unequal men and

31
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:28,319
women's experience of getting older can be. Barbara Hannah Grofferman is an American writer who

32
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:35,120
publishes a regular newsletter the Menopause cheat sheet which focuses on healthy aging.

33
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,800
Here she is speaking with BBC World Service programme the conversation.

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,280
One of the biggest complications I think is ageism so if women are entering that age range 45

35
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,479
and over they are already possibly feeling the effects of ageism pointing in their direction.

36
00:03:54,479 --> 00:04:01,439
And then when they add on this layer of having these physical symptoms that can impact

37
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,800
how they are functioning at work or even at home it is a double whammy.

38
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,840
For Barbara Hannah Grofferman one of the biggest barriers women face is ageism the unfair

39
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,959
treatment of older people because of their age. Just as racism and sexism discriminate against

40
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,199
people because of their race or gender ageism values older people less than the young.

41
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:33,920
As you mentioned before the Menopause brings physical signs such as hot flashes or night sweats.

42
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:40,720
These signs are known as symptoms things wrong with your body or mind that are signs of some illness

43
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,080
or bodily process. So Menopause or women suffer physical symptoms as well as possibly

44
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:55,120
dealing with discrimination based on their age. Barbara Hannah Grofferman calls this a double whammy

45
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,040
and in formal way to describe a situation where two unpleasant things happen at the same time.

46
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:08,160
The Menopause can be a difficult time in a woman's life but with age comes wisdom and experience

47
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,000
and in more and more societies around the world that Menopause is being talked about more openly.

48
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,920
Speaking of which what was the answer to your question, Sam?

49
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,160
In my quiz question I asked about the average age for British women to reach Menopause.

50
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:33,360
I said it was C51. Which was the correct answer, although for some women Menopause can start as

51
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:40,319
early as in their 40s. Okay let's recap the vocabulary from this program starting with taboo,

52
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:47,439
something which is forbidden for social or religious reasons. To pay your dues means to do your

53
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:54,720
duty. surplus to requirements means to be no longer needed. Ageism is the unfair treatment of

54
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:02,080
older people because of their age. Symptom is a sign of illness. And finally a double whammy is a

55
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:07,839
situation where two unpleasant things happen at once. That's all from us but we hope to see you

56
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,199
again soon. Bye for now. Goodbye!
