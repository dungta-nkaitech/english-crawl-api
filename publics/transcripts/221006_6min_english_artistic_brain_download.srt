6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish.com

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And I'm Sam.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Would you say your artistic Sam? Can you draw or paint? Do you dance or play music?

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I play the piano a bit. Yes, I'd say I'm quite artistic. How about you, Neil?

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Well, if you count playing football as artistic then yes, but basically no, I can't paint.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We've been wondering why artistic ability comes more naturally to some people than others.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So in this programme we'll be asking, are artist brains different?

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We'll hear two expert opinions and as usual we'll learn some useful new vocabulary as well.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So what do you think, Neil? Are artist brains different from other people's?

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm not sure, Sam, but it's true that many artists behave differently, often in very strange ways.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
For example, did you know that Michelangelo worked so hard he never took a bath,

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
or that guitar legend Jimmy Hendrix once set fire to his guitar on stage?

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We'll hear more about the artist's brain soon, but first I have a question for you.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
As you said, artistic ability comes naturally to some people, including the famous composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Mozart was considered a child prodigy, a young child with very great musical talent.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So how old was Mozart when he composed his first piece of music?

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Was he A, 5 years old, B, 10 years old, or C, 15 years old?

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I guess he was A, 5 years old.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay, Sam, I'll reveal the answer later in the program.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
If artist brains are different, it could mean they see the world in unusual ways.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Dr. Rebecca Chamberlain is a researcher in the neuroscience of art.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
She investigates how artists see the objects they are drawing by measuring saccades.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The rapid movements are eyes make as they jump from one thing to another.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Here she shares her findings with BBC World Service Programme Crowd Science.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Artists seem to be processing the visual world in a different way than on artists, particularly when they're drawing.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The artists actually take a more global approach to looking, so they make bigger saccades, bigger eye movements, and shorter fixations on the image.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So it's almost like they're getting much more of a kind of just level view of the thing that they're looking at.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Rebecca's experiments seem to confirm that artists' brains work differently because of their processing of the visual world.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The way their brains make sense of information.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Interestingly, processing also means the act of developing pictures from photographic film.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
When they draw, artists make bigger, quicker eye movements, so they're able to see the whole picture.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Something also known as the gist, the overall general impression of something without focusing on the details.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
If you get the gist of what someone is saying, you understand the overall meaning of what they say, but not the details.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The second expert to answer our question about the artistic brain is Mike, a BBC World Service listener from Malawi.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Mike is a self-taught painter who creates large, colourful pictures in his studio.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:44,000
According to him, artistic ability isn't something you're born with. It can be learned as he explained to BBC World Services Crowdscience.

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I had this other student. He was like really at the zero. Like he could not grow at all.

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So I gave him some tips and in a month he was like really good. He was like really surprised, blown away. He never expected.

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So there are some things that are trained about. It's like a bike.

42
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:13,000
In my case, I learned how to do those things without anyone telling me. You know, like if you are drawing the face, a human face, the distance between your eyes is the same as one of your eyes.

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Mike gives tips to his students, helpful pieces of advice about how to do something, in this case, to paint.

44
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
After getting Mike's tips, one of his students really improved and started painting much better.

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Mike was blown away, an informal way to say very impressed or surprised.

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Like learning to write a bike, Mike thinks that painting is trainable. A word from American English meaning that it can be taught or trained.

47
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
For him, this is proof that artist brains are not so different after all.

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So there we have it, two different opinions, but no final answer to our question. Still, some scientists think there may be a third possibility.

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Everyone's brain works by focusing on some areas and ignoring others, making a kind of jigsaw puzzle with missing pieces.

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Maybe all of us, you, me, Mozart and Jimmy Hendrix, are just filling in the missing pieces our own way.

51
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Speaking of Mozart, Neil, it's time to reveal the answer to your question.

52
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Right, I asked how old child prodigy Mozart was when he first composed music.

53
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And I said he was five years old, so was I right?

54
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Your answer was correct. Mozart was five when he first wrote music and by the age of six, he had performed in front of the Emperor of Austria twice.

55
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Now there's an artistic brain.

56
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay, Neil, let's recap the vocabulary from this program, starting with child prodigy, a young child like Mozart with a great talent in something.

57
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Processing describes how your brain makes sense of the information it receives.

58
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The gist of something is a general understanding of it without the details.

59
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Tips are useful pieces of advice about how to do something better.

60
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
If you are blown away, you are very impressed or surprised by something.

61
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And finally, trainable means able to be trained or taught in American English.

62
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Once again, our six minutes are up. It's goodbye for now.

63
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Goodbye.
