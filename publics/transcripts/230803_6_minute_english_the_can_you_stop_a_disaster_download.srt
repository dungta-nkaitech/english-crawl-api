6-Mute English from the BBC

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,679
Hello, this is 6-Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Beth.

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,320
And I'm Neil. Now, depending on how you look at it,

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,719
Roy Sullivan was either the luckiest or the unluckiest man alive.

5
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:27,440
Working as a US park ranger, Roy was struck by lightning on seven different occasions

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,400
and survived them all.

7
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:34,320
But Roy isn't the only victim of an unpredictable natural event,

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,159
sometimes called an act of God.

9
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:43,159
In the last decade, an estimated half a million people have died globally in natural disasters,

10
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:47,359
such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes and cyclones.

11
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:54,200
In 2023, at least 60,000 people died after earthquakes in Turkey and Syria,

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,439
and things are predicted to get worse in the future due to climate change

13
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:00,759
and increasing populations.

14
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:04,560
So can anything be done to stop natural disasters?

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,959
Or like Roy Sullivan, should we accept that some things are beyond our control?

16
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:12,239
In this programme, we'll be finding out,

17
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,640
and as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary too.

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,840
Throughout history, floods, when there's too much water and droughts,

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,479
when there isn't enough, have caused most human deaths,

20
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,280
but with climate change, new dangers are emerging.

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,239
But do you know Neil, which natural disaster is most responsible for human deaths now?

22
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:40,359
I'm not sure, but you do hear a lot about terrible earthquakes in the news, don't you?

23
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,680
Yeah, probably earthquakes.

24
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,000
Now, in her job as professor of hazard and risk at Durham University,

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,319
Lucy Easthope attends conferences to advise on planning for natural emergencies.

26
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:58,319
But according to Lucy, describing disasters as natural is a mistake,

27
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,639
as she told BBC Radio 4 programme Inside Science.

28
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:06,119
Probably the worst thing you can do at a disaster conference

29
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,319
is describe it as natural disaster,

30
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,799
because that's the hopelessness right there.

31
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:15,759
The natural implies a sense of fatalism and a sense of, let's give up now,

32
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,799
whereas in fact, these events, there's huge elements that we have in our grasp

33
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,560
to both prevent, and more importantly, perhaps, prevent additional harm.

34
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,520
Professor Easthope thinks calling disasters natural is fatalistic.

35
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,000
It involves the belief that people are powerless to change events.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,400
Although no one can prevent an earthquake,

37
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,480
there are ways people can reduce the damage done,

38
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,680
what Professor Easthope calls additional harm.

39
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,280
Often, this additional harm, things like the spread of diseases

40
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,520
or destroyed roads and buildings are worse than the disaster itself.

41
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,719
Fortunately, ways to limit the damage are within our grasp.

42
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:03,360
If something is within your grasp, it's very likely that you will achieve it.

43
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,240
It may be impossible to stop disasters from happening,

44
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,400
but there are ways to limit the number of deaths.

45
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,840
An earthquake in the middle of the ocean is less of a disaster than in a populated city,

46
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,080
so one technological solution involves computers mapping geological movements

47
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,640
to identify places at risk.

48
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,080
But low-tech solutions can be just as effective.

49
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,400
Bangladesh has seen a hundred-fold decrease in cyclone deaths

50
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,719
since the introduction of its new monitoring and alert system.

51
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:40,039
Elon Kalman, Professor of Disasters and Health at UCL,

52
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:45,400
has been involved in the project and told BBC Radio 4's Inside Science

53
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:47,120
how it worked.

54
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,319
What Bangladesh has done is realized we cannot have a hundred thousand people dying in a cyclone each time.

55
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:58,240
So in addition to having people on bicycles with megaphones going out and saying,

56
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,960
look, a cyclone is coming, please get to shelter.

57
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:06,599
People in the danger zones have grown up accepting that their shelters will be safe,

58
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,840
knowing where the evacuation routes are,

59
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,759
but most importantly, that they can return afterwards to their homes and to their livelihoods

60
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,079
because they've built the infrastructure and they've built their jobs

61
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,560
in order to avoid being destroyed by the cyclone.

62
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,120
One low-tech solution involves people on bicycles shouting warnings

63
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,000
about approaching cyclones into a megaphone,

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,920
a handheld cone-shaped device that makes your voice louder when you speak into it.

65
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,759
Once people know the danger, they can start the evacuation,

66
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,199
moving people from a dangerous place to somewhere safe.

67
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:47,120
The Bangladeshes have built shelters which protect everyone, children, the old and sick,

68
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,079
even animals, so that when the cyclone is over,

69
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,839
they can safely return to their livelihoods, their job and other activities

70
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,279
which give them the things they need to live.

71
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,279
Well, it's great to see people working together to survive cyclones.

72
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,680
Earlier, we were talking about other natural disasters.

73
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,319
We were and I asked you which disaster you thought caused most deaths

74
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,879
and you said you thought maybe earthquakes, which was the right answer,

75
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,800
which is why these new ideas to save lives are so hopeful.

76
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,399
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt from this programme on natural disasters.

77
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:30,240
Unpredictable events or catastrophes which cannot be controlled by humans

78
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,000
and which are sometimes called acts of God.

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,439
Fatalism is the belief that people are powerless to change the way things happen.

80
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,240
If something is within your grasp, it's likely to be accomplished.

81
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,439
A megaphone is a handheld cone-shaped device

82
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,759
that makes your voice louder when you speak into it so that people can hear you from far away.

83
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,199
Evacuation means moving people from a dangerous place to somewhere safe.

84
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,720
And finally, livelihood is your job or the work that gives you money to buy the things you need to live.

85
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,839
Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye, everyone. Bye.
