Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Neil.

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,080
And I'm Georgina.

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,440
Covid-19 has changed everyday life for people in countries around the world.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,960
But coronavirus wasn't the first pandemic to cause mass sickness and disrupt daily life.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,480
Between 2002 and 2004, an outbreak of the disease known as SARS,

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,160
or severe acute respiratory syndrome, caused hundreds of deaths in southern China

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,640
before spreading to other parts of the world.

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,200
The virus that caused SARS survived by mutating,

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,359
changing as it reproduced itself in the bodies of infected people.

11
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,159
And this caused the virus to create strains, slight variations of the original.

12
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:03,439
Covid-19, the disease caused by the strain of the original SARS virus we are experiencing now,

13
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,359
has been called SARS-2.

14
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,840
In this programme, we'll be looking at the origins of Covid-19,

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,239
and hearing new evidence about the scale of the threat we face from the disease.

16
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,679
And of course, we'll be learning some new vocabulary as well.

17
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:20,159
But first, it's time for our quiz question.

18
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,679
We know that white blood cells make up part of the immune system our body needs to fight

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,920
infectious diseases like Covid-19, but how many white blood cells per microleiter does the

20
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:40,240
average adult human need? Is it A, 7000, B, 17000, or C, 70000?

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,320
Hmm, in that case, I'd say more is better, so C, 70,000.

22
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,200
Okay, we'll find out the answer at the end of the programme.

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,280
Now, Georgina, you mentioned that the disease spreading across the world today

24
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,560
wasn't the first Covid-19 type disease.

25
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,280
That's right. In fact, a recent research project in China has identified over 700 different types

26
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,520
of coronavirus carried by bats. Some of these virus strains are thought to have already crossed

27
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,400
over to humans. Dr Peter Dasack of New York's Eco Health Alliance

28
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,680
thinks that new strains of the virus have the potential to cause future pandemics.

29
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,120
He spent years in the Chinese countryside looking for the coronavirus that could jump from

30
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,879
bats to humans. Here he is talking to the BBC World Service Programme Science in Action.

31
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,680
It would have been great to have found the precursor to SARS-2, but what it would have been

32
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,280
even better is to have found it before SARS-2 emerged and raise the red flag on it and stop the

33
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,120
outbreak. But we didn't do that. What we were looking for were at the time, our hypothesis was that

34
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,920
SARS-1, the original SARS virus, which we all thought had disappeared, was still out there in bats

35
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,280
and that was what we were looking for. So we found a lot of SARS-1 related viruses.

36
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,240
Covid-19 may have been contained if scientists had known more about the disease as precursor.

37
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,120
That's a situation which existed before something and led to the development of that thing.

38
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,759
Here, the precursor of Covid-19 was the original SARS-1.

39
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,560
Any new cases of the virus would have been a red flag for another outbreak,

40
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,879
a symbol of danger that some action needs to be taken. Dr. Dasack believed that some form of SARS

41
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,280
remained in bats and based his investigations on this hypothesis, an idea which is suggested as a

42
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,799
possible explanation of something but which has not yet been proved correct. Another scientist

43
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,359
working to prevent new epidemics is the pathologist Professor Mary Falks.

44
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,840
The original SARS was treated as a respiratory disease which attacked the lungs.

45
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,240
But when working with infected patients, Professor Falks noticed that Covid-19 was damaging the

46
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:01,920
brain, blood and other organs as well. Clinicians have recognized that a lot of patients that have

47
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,960
Covid are exhibiting confusion, not necessarily aware of their environment appropriately,

48
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,200
some are having seizures. So there are some central nervous system abnormalities and as you know,

49
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,960
a lot of patients are exhibiting loss of sense of smell and that is a direct connection to the

50
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:27,519
brain as well. In some infected patients, coronavirus attacks the central nervous system,

51
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:32,480
the body's main system of nerve control consisting of the brain and spinal cord.

52
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,960
When severe, this can cause seizures, sudden violent attacks of an illness,

53
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:42,560
often affecting the heart or brain. It seems that Covid-19 type diseases are not going to

54
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,919
disappear anytime soon. Reminding us of the importance of the scientific research we've heard

55
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,759
about today. And the importance of boosting your immunity, which reminds me of today's quiz question.

56
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:01,279
You asked me how many white blood cells per microelita the human body has. I said C-70,000.

57
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,000
Well, if that was true, you've definitely boosted your immunity, Georgina,

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,919
because the correct answer is C, just 7,000. Today we've been discussing the strains or slight

59
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:19,599
variations of the virus, which causes Covid-19. Covid-19 has a previous disease called SARS as

60
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:25,839
its precursor, a situation which existed before something and caused the development of that thing.

61
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,959
Researchers used the idea that the virus had passed to humans from bats as their hypothesis.

62
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:38,159
Possible explanation for something which has not yet been proved true. By identifying new virus

63
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:45,199
strains, doctors hope unexplained cases can act as a red flag, a warning sign of danger to prevent

64
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,879
further outbreaks. Knowing about new strains is increasingly important as we find out more about

65
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:56,719
how coronavirus attacks the body's central nervous system, the brain and spinal cord,

66
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,160
which in some patients can cause seizures. Sudden violent attacks of an illness,

67
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,600
especially affecting the heart or brain. So try to stay safe, wash your hands and remember to

68
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,240
join us again soon. Bye for now. Bye!
