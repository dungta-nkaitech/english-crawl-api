5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,599
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,559
And I'm Rob.

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,640
Now Rob, we've talked before on this program about our love of coffee.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,600
Oh yes indeed, I couldn't function without it.

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,879
But have you ever thought about the environmental consequences of all those disposable coffee cups?

10
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,320
Oh yes indeed, I always carry a reusable cup with me,

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,159
so I don't have to throw one away.

12
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,439
So if a disposable cup is one you throw away,

13
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,879
a reusable one is one that you can use again and again.

14
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,840
Yes, there's a big problem with disposable cups,

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,320
in that many of them can't be recycled.

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,079
So there's a lot of waste for something we only use for a short time.

17
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,560
What are the big coffee shop chains doing about this problem?

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,239
We'll find out a little bit more shortly, but first a quiz for you.

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,440
Which country drinks the most coffee per capita?

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,280
So not the total amount of coffee, but the average per person.

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,680
Is it a, Japan, B, Kenya or C, Finland?

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,799
What do you think Rob?

23
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,920
Oh, tricky.

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,480
Now I don't think the Japanese are big coffee drinkers,

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,879
and I know they produce a lot of coffee in Kenya.

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,520
I'm surprised the USA isn't on the list,

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,719
but I'm going to go for Finland just because.

28
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,359
Well, we'll see if you're right later in the program.

29
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,200
On a recent BBC,

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,719
you and yours radio program,

31
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:30,959
they discuss the topic of coffee cups.

32
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,359
Some of the big chains are now charging customers more for a disposable cup

33
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:38,159
and giving discounts if people bring their own reusable.

34
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,159
However, not all of the shops actually collect old cups

35
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,400
and sort them for recycling in the shop itself.

36
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:47,039
Here's Jasra Bardier from Starbucks.

37
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,519
Is the store only interested in facilities inside their shops?

38
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,039
It is something that we are in the process of rolling out,

39
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,039
and it will be in all of our stores.

40
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,239
It's also not just our stores in which these cups end up.

41
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,879
So we're doing a lot of work outside of our store environment

42
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,239
to ensure that paper cups can be recycled on the go.

43
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,879
We're working with our environmental charity partner Hubbub

44
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,000
to increase recycling infrastructure outside of our stores,

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,359
because that too is where a lot of our cups will end up.

46
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,680
So are they just working in their stores at improving recycling?

47
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,560
Well, no.

48
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,120
Well, no. After all, most people take their coffee out of the stores,

49
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,800
so they're working on the recycling infrastructure outside as well.

50
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,000
This will be things like bins and collection points,

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,400
which are clearly marked for coffee cups.

52
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,000
And what about enabling recycling cups in store?

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Well, she said that was something they are rolling out to all stores.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,280
Rolling out here means introducing over a period of time,

55
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,240
so it's starting to happen, but it's not finished yet.

56
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,520
Let's listen again.

57
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,520
It is something that we are in the process of rolling out,

58
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,520
and it will be in all of our stores.

59
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,800
It's also not just our stores in which these cups end up.

60
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,680
So we're doing a lot of work outside of our store environment

61
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,439
to ensure that paper cups can be recycled on the go.

62
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:07,920
We're working with our environmental charity partner Hubbub

63
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,039
to increase recycling infrastructure outside of our stores,

64
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:13,680
because that too is where a lot of our cups will end up.

65
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:17,599
Not everyone, however, believes that the coffee chains

66
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,920
are doing everything that they can.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,199
This is Mary Kray, a member of the British Parliament.

68
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:26,799
She compares the situation to that of the plastic bag charge.

69
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:31,839
This was a law brought in to force shops to charge customers for plastic bags,

70
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:33,519
which previously had been free.

71
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,759
If you think you're having to pay extra for something,

72
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,599
as we saw with the plastic bags,

73
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,479
we think a similar psychological measure is needed,

74
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,439
a nudge measure, to encourage people to remember

75
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,479
to bring their reusable cup with them.

76
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,959
And of course, this is something that the coffee shops have been fighting tooth and nail.

77
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,239
She thinks that we consumers need a nudge to help us remember our reusable cups.

78
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,280
Yes, we need a nudge, which is a little push, a reason.

79
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,799
In this case, she is thinking of a law to make them charge more.

80
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:07,839
But she says the coffee chains really don't want this.

81
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:10,639
They are, she says, fighting it tooth and nail.

82
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:12,399
If you fight something tooth and nail,

83
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:15,359
you're against it completely and try to stop it.

84
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:17,519
Let's hear MP Mary Kray again.

85
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,279
If you think you're having to pay extra for something,

86
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,120
as we saw with the plastic bags,

87
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,000
we think a similar psychological measure is needed,

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,959
a nudge measure, to encourage people to remember

89
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,000
to bring their reusable cup with them.

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,399
And of course, this is something that the coffee shops have been fighting tooth and nail.

91
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:42,399
Time to review our vocabulary, but first let's have the answer to the quiz question.

92
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,680
Which country drinks the most coffee per capita?

93
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,840
Is it A, Japan?

94
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,480
B, Kenya or C, Finland?

95
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,840
What do you think, Rob?

96
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,240
I took a bit of a guess at Finland.

97
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,519
Well, congratulations, your guess was correct.

98
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:02,399
The fins on average get through an amazing 12 kilograms of coffee a year each.

99
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,040
Now onto the vocabulary.

100
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,600
We had a couple of related but opposite words.

101
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,960
Something disposable is designed to be used once or a few times and then thrown away.

102
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,560
And a reusable is designed to be used again and again.

103
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,479
We then had rolling out, which in a business sense is the process of gradually introducing something new.

104
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,199
This could be a new system, new product, new technology,

105
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,039
or even a new way of doing things.

106
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,319
New ideas often need new infrastructure.

107
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,000
This is usually physical structures that are needed to make something work.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,799
For example, rail infrastructure includes things like tracks, stations and signals.

109
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:42,079
A nudge is a small push to encourage us to do something.

110
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,519
You don't need a nudge to carry a reusable coffee cup, do you?

111
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,959
Oh no, I'm all for it.

112
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:51,120
In fact, I'd fight tooth and nail to keep hold of my reusable,

113
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,800
which is quite a coincidence, as that was our last expression today.

114
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,839
To fight tooth and nail means to make a strong effort to try to stop something or achieve something.

115
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:00,799
Well, that's all from us.

116
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:02,799
We look forward to your company next time.

117
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:06,399
Until then, you can find us in all the usual places on social media,

118
