00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,640
Hello, I'm Catherine. Welcome to 6 Minute English,

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,480
where we engage in some lively debate and discuss six stimulating items of vocabulary.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,440
And let's start. Here's your cup of coffee, Rob.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,320
Ah, thanks, but what took you so long, Catherine?

9
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,240
Oh, sorry, Rob. I bumped into someone I knew in the cafe and we stopped for a chat.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,840
Okay, well, that fits well with today's show where we're talking about cafes or coffee houses.

11
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:42,719
Did you know, Catherine, that coffee houses were originally a meeting place for

12
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,200
lively debate and intellectual discussion?

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,960
Really? I did know that, Rob. And a debate, by the way,

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,000
means a discussion that a lot of people take part in.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,120
So how long ago was this debating society?

16
00:00:55,599 --> 00:00:59,839
Well, the first coffee house was set up in Oxford in 1650,

17
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:04,159
but they quickly became popular and soon they were all over London too.

18
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,239
You paid a penny to get in and this included access to newspapers and stimulating conversation.

19
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:15,120
If something is stimulating, it encourages ideas and enthusiasm.

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,359
And I expect the coffee held with that a bit, did it?

21
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,519
No, it certainly helps me first thing in the morning.

22
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,920
Which brings me on to today's question, Rob.

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,400
How many cups of coffee do we consume in coffee shops or stores in the UK every year?

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,480
Consume, by the way, is another word for eat or drink?

25
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:43,359
So is the answer A, 2.3 million, B, 23 million, or C, 23 billion?

26
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,159
Well, I don't really know, but it's got to be a lot.

27
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,640
So I'm going to go for C, 23 billion.

28
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,040
That sounds like a lot of coffee, but I buy several cups a week and I expect you to do,

29
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,680
Catherine. I do indeed. But I have to say, while I was getting our coffees earlier,

30
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,920
there was nobody else in the cafe talking except me and my friend.

31
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,680
Everybody else was sitting on their own, tapping away on their laptops.

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's listen now to Douglas Fraser, BBC Scotland's Business and Economy Editor,

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,680
describing the vibe or atmosphere in a typical 21st century cafe.

34
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:23,439
Ten or so in the morning, the cafe has five people at tables with their backs to the wall,

35
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:27,039
each staring into a screen, plugged in, years plugged.

36
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,959
The flow of bites through these coffee shops, free Wi-Fi, is transporting these customers

37
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,719
to diverse destinations far from the person beside them.

38
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,799
Collaborative working, research grant application, a potential blockbuster novel,

39
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:47,039
and inevitably someone distracted by kitten pictures on social media.

40
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,439
So the spirit of those 17th century coffee houses had disappeared then, no more lively debate

41
00:02:53,439 --> 00:03:00,560
and intellectual discussion. It seems so, Rob. As Douglas Fraser says, many people sit alone,

42
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,239
plugged into their laptops, and they're all doing different things, working, writing, messing

43
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,759
about on social media. And I think the cafe owners should turn off the free Wi-Fi and force

44
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,959
these cafe squatters to move on. I don't think people should be allowed to sit all day

45
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,799
using the internet, hogging tables, and not talking to anybody, especially when some of them don't

46
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:28,799
even buy coffee. That's a bit extreme, Rob. Cafe owners need customers, and they encourage people

47
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:35,759
to stay by having comfy sofas and newspapers to read and the free Wi-Fi. A squatter, by the way,

48
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:41,199
is someone who lives in an empty building without paying rent. And if you hog something,

49
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,039
you use most or all of it in a selfish way. I suppose you're right, Catherine.

50
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:52,560
Now, how about telling us the answer to today's question then? Okay, so I asked how many cups of

51
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:59,919
coffee do we consume in cafes or stores in the UK every year? Is it a 2.3 million,

52
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:06,879
b 23 million, or c 23 billion? Well, I could sit in a cafe using their free Wi-Fi to research

53
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,719
the answer, but I had a guess, and I said 23 billion. Well, you didn't need that free Wi-Fi,

54
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:21,680
Rob, because you were absolutely right. 23 billion coffees per year works out on average at 45 cups

55
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,439
per adult in the UK. Okay, I think it's time we look back at the words we learned today. Our

56
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:33,839
first word is debate, a discussion that a lot of people take part in. For example, I took part in

57
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:41,279
a number of stimulating debates at school. Number two, if something is stimulating, it encourages

58
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:47,599
new ideas and enthusiasm. For example, it's hard to have a stimulating conversation with someone

59
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:52,879
who's looking at their phone all the time. That's very true. Let me just slide my phone in my pocket.

60
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:02,159
Our next word is consume another word for eating or drinking, but it can also mean to use. For example,

61
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:10,160
my car consumes a lot of petrol. Or how do I calculate my car's fuel consumption? So consumption

62
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:18,640
there is the noun. Number four is vibe, which means the mood or atmosphere in a place. For example,

63
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:25,600
Oxford is a city, but it has a small town vibe. Well, I'm getting bad vibes from our next word,

64
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,360
which is squatter. That's someone who lives in an empty building without paying rent. The building

65
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,000
is called a squat. So, for example, I lived in a squat for two years. Really? You squatted in a

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,280
squat, Rob. No, no, no, it was just an example. I am not a squatter. Oh, so you've never squatted.

67
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,879
No, I haven't. Now look, we're wasting time here. We need to move on to our final word hog. If you

68
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:55,360
hog something, you use all or most of it in a selfish way. For example, Rob, you've hogged the

69
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,000
only comfy chair. That's so selfish. I admit it, Catherine. I'm a chair hog. That's the noun.

70
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,120
Okay, well, before we head off for another cup of coffee, please remember to check out our

71
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,080
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages. Bye. Bye bye.
