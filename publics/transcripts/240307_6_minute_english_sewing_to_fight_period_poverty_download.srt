Hello, this is 6-Mute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Georgi and I'm Beth.

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,839
Mentionation is an issue that's not often talked about, yet every month it affects

4
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:26,879
billions of women around the world. Mentionation or periods are a natural process that typically

5
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:32,719
happen once a month, when women and girls bleed from their vagina for a few days as part of

6
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:39,840
the reproductive cycle. When this happens, women need special products like sanitary pads or tampons

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,560
to manage the flow of blood and go about their day-to-day life. Unfortunately, over 500 million

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,920
people around the world either don't have access to these products or can't afford to buy them,

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,960
and this is called period poverty. Period poverty has serious consequences. For example,

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,719
girls on their periods not going to school affects their education, and women who can't work during

11
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:11,040
their period have less income. What's more, it can cause health problems because without sanitary

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,120
products it's easy to get infections. In this programme we'll be learning about one project

13
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,439
fighting period poverty affecting thousands of women refugees, and of course we'll be learning

14
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:30,719
some useful new vocabulary as well. But first Georgi, I have a question for you. Periods affect girls

15
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:39,840
and women of reproductive age. That's roughly half the female population or 26% of the global population,

16
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:51,520
but how many people is that? Is it a 2.1 billion people, b 2.3 billion people, or c 2.5 billion people?

17
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:58,320
I guess it's about 2.1 billion people. Okay Georgi, I will reveal the answer at the end of the programme.

18
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,719
Ella Lambert was a student at Bristol University when she started the Pacha Mama project in 2020

19
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,479
during the first Covid lockdown. She'd heard about period poverty and decided to put her lockdown

20
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:19,840
time to good use by making sanitary pads. Pieces of soft material used to absorb menstrual blood.

21
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,039
Here's Ella explaining how her project got started to BBC World Service programme people fixing

22
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,919
the world. So I borrowed a sewing machine from a friend, I learned how to sew on YouTube,

23
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,719
and then I just started making pads. And even now to this day I can't sew anything else, only pads.

24
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:45,279
Ella started making reusable sanitary pads, which aren't a new thing. They're made from

25
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:50,799
absorbent fabrics such as fleece and cotton sheets, which means that they can be used over and

26
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:57,279
over again after they're washed, unlike disposable pads. Ella spent lockdown learning how to sew,

27
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,120
how to join pieces of material by hand using a needle and thread or with a sewing machine.

28
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,039
In fact, Ella was so focused on sewing sanitary pads she didn't make anything else.

29
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,800
And to this day, pads are the only thing she knows how to sew. Ella uses the phrase to this day,

30
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:25,360
to say up to and including the present moment. Sanitary pads aren't easy to make. The outer layer

31
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,520
has to be soft because it touches the skin, but they also need to be absorbent, able to soak up

32
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:38,960
liquids like blood and hold them. What's more, Ella designed her pads to be washed and used again,

33
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:45,920
unlike most sanitary pads bought in shops, which are disposable, designed to be thrown away after

34
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:53,200
they've been used. Ella's network of volunteers sewing reusable sanitary pads grew. And to date,

35
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:59,280
the Pachamama project has donated tens of thousands of period products to refugees, fleeing

36
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:07,119
conflict in Syria, Turkey and Lebanon, as well as women here in the UK. Plus, the project is helping

37
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:14,719
in other ways too. Despite affecting so many people and being necessary for life itself, many

38
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:22,879
cultures consider menstruation unclean or shameful, not a topic of polite conversation, but

39
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:28,959
Ella thinks her project is giving refugees the confidence to talk about periods. As she told

40
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:36,879
BBC World Services, people fixing the world. I have seen such major change in such a short period

41
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:41,279
of time. Like the women originally who were distributing the pads were barely even speak about

42
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,920
it and we had it behind a curtain. And now they're chatted away about the pads with their male

43
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:52,000
colleagues, anyone that comes into the shop. Before, most women refugees would barely talk about

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,639
menstruation. They would only just scarcely talk about it. But now they're happily chatting away,

45
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,720
passing the time talking to other women and even to male colleagues. I think it's time I reveal

46
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:13,120
the answer to my question. As a number, how many women make up the 26% of the world's population

47
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:21,680
who menstruates? I said it was 2.1 billion people, which was the correct answer. Okay, let's recap the

48
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,000
vocabulary we've learned in this programme, starting with the verb to sew, to join material together

49
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,040
using a needle and thread, either by hand or with a sewing machine. The phrase to this day means up to

50
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:41,759
and including the present moment. The adjective absorbent means able to soak up and hold liquid,

51
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:49,039
and the adjective disposable means designed to be thrown away after use. If you barely do something,

52
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:55,599
you only just do it by the smallest amount. And finally, to chat away means to pass the time

53
00:05:55,599 --> 00:06:01,759
by talking a lot with someone. Once again, our six minutes are up. We hope you'll join us again

54
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,199
next time here at six minute English. Bye for now. Bye!
