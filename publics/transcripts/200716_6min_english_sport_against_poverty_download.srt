00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,480
Hello, this is 6MIT English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,600
And I'm Sam.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,320
We all know that sport is great for our health,

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,280
and if you're talented, it can make you rich.

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,879
Many great champions have found a way out of poverty

10
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,960
through their sporting ability.

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,440
Think of someone like footballer Maradona.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,640
But in today's programme, we're not looking at the superstars.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,480
Instead, we'll discuss how sport can change the lives of young people

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,520
from some of the poorest toughest backgrounds on earth.

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,880
And of course, we'll be learning some vocabulary on the way.

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,040
Many projects around the world use sports to change children's lives,

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,640
improving mental health, challenging stereotypes and giving hope.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,760
Among them is the Ebony Club in Brixton,

19
00:00:55,839 --> 00:01:00,799
which uses sport to help young people in London's most disadvantaged communities.

20
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,839
But which sport, that's my quiz question.

21
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:07,840
Is it a, golf, b, tennis or sea horse riding?

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, I can't imagine there's enough space for golf and horse riding in the city,

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,560
so I'll say b, tennis.

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,879
Okay, we'll find out the answer later.

25
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,680
Just now, we were talking about London,

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,159
but sporting projects like the Ebony Club are happening all over the world.

27
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,479
In Cape Town, South Africa, British surfer Tim Conneber,

28
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,439
noticed how kids from poor townships hardly ever went to the beach.

29
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,959
So he started giving them free surfing lessons.

30
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,840
Tim founded the Waves for Changes project,

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,239
and now hundreds of kids go along each week to get surfing therapy.

32
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,560
Not only is surfing giving them a buzz,

33
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,959
it's helping to improve their life chances.

34
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:52,479
Here he is, talking to the BBC World Service programme,

35
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,160
People Fixing the World.

36
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,840
Surfing also is quite difficult, so you're learning a very challenging skill,

37
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,359
which takes a lot of confidence.

38
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,240
Are these very small successes that children have when they go into the water?

39
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,159
It lists a really big emotional response.

40
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,240
So if you come from a background of trauma, quite often you'll have a negative self-image.

41
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,719
And being able to try something new, achieve something new,

42
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:16,800
be recognised by a coach or a mentor is very, very good for your confidence as well.

43
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,960
Most of the surfers have experienced trauma,

44
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,280
emotional pain and shock caused by very distressing experiences.

45
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,400
This has given them a negative self-image,

46
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,439
the way a person feels about themselves,

47
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,560
their ability, personality and value.

48
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,640
Surfing helps kids improve their self-image because it's challenging,

49
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,240
difficult in a way that tests your ability and determination.

50
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,000
So challenging, in fact, that the children have a mentor,

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,360
a trusted adviser who gives help and support

52
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,560
to a younger or less experienced person.

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,760
Tim believes that the concentration needed to surf makes the children's other problems disappear,

54
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,440
at least for a short time.

55
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,560
And the results so far have been optimistic

56
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,320
with a significant reduction in violent behaviour reported

57
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,560
among Cape Town's young surfers.

58
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,880
Surfing is quite well known in South Africa,

59
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,080
but what happens when you take a completely unknown sport

60
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,480
into one of the least developed countries on Earth?

61
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,679
In 2007, Australian Oliver Perkovich was travelling in Afghanistan

62
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:23,199
with his skateboard.

63
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,359
The children there were fascinated,

64
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:28,159
so he started showing them how to skate.

65
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,679
The idea grew, and a few years later he founded the organisation Skater Stan,

66
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:37,679
giving free skateboard lessons to children aged 5 to 17,

67
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:39,839
with a focus on those with disabilities

68
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:42,879
from low income backgrounds and especially girls.

69
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,159
His Skater Stan volunteer Jessica Faulkner,

70
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,960
explaining how skateboarding reinforces positive educational messages

71
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,680
which Afghan kids don't always get at home.

72
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,199
There's a few things that the skateboarding does as a kind of function.

73
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,680
It is really quite challenging, it's not an easy sport for anyone, whether you're young or old.

74
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,560
And that means that it also teaches quite a lot of life skills.

75
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,919
You have to fall off a skateboard quite a lot of times before you get better,

76
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,959
and it really helps children with things like goal setting and resilience and determination.

77
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,879
Also, and really importantly, we do believe that children should have fun.

78
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,839
Like surfing, skateboarding is challenging and difficult.

79
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:29,120
It requires effort, and Jessica believes this teaches children important life skills.

80
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,480
The basic skills needed to solve problems commonly encountered in everyday life.

81
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,919
One important life skill is goal setting,

82
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,319
deciding what things you want to achieve, and how you plan to achieve them.

83
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,520
Along with other skills like determination and resilience,

84
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,560
this helps kids improve their outlook on life.

85
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,960
And to experience one of the most important things, having fun.

86
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,160
Which reminds me about the kids at the Ebony Club and my quiz question.

87
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,759
Remember that I asked you which sport the club uses to support disadvantaged children in London?

88
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,680
Yeah, and I said B, tennis.

89
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,680
But in fact, it's sea horse riding, a sport normally associated with the elite.

90
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,879
In this episode, we've been discussing how sport can help improve the life chances of young people

91
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:23,360
from tough backgrounds, many of whom have suffered trauma, severe emotional pain and distress.

92
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,040
Such pain damages a child's self-image, how they see and value themselves in the world.

93
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,480
This can be improved by taking part in sports, like surfing, skating and horse riding,

94
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,400
which are challenging, demanding and testing of your abilities.

95
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,840
Often kids are supported by a mentor, a trusted, more experienced friend who can offer help and advice.

96
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,120
And with this support, they learn life skills.

97
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,400
Basic skills everyone needs to cope with everyday problems.

98
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,200
One important skill is goal setting, deciding what you want to accomplish and planning how to do it.

99
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,319
And of course, sometimes the most important goal is just to have fun.

100
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,959
That's all we have time for. Join us again soon as we discuss more topical issues.

101
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,240
Bye for now. Bye.
