00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,800
Hello, this is 6-Middit English from BBC Learning English.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,599
I'm Beth.

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,599
And I'm Neil.

5
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,800
I have a confession to make Neil.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,000
I love the hot weather.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,400
It's a chance to get outside, maybe get a suntan.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,600
But sometimes it gets too hot, even for me.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,879
Yes, depending where in the world you live, you've probably noticed that it's getting

10
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:32,280
hotter year after year.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,079
2023 is the hottest year on record, with heat waves in many countries around the world,

12
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,379
even Britain.

13
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:43,679
When it gets too hot, the human body knows how to cool down.

14
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:49,560
It sweats, passing salty water, cold sweat, through the skin to lose heat.

15
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,200
But unlike the body, houses don't know how to keep cool.

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,719
And in hot parts of the world where air conditioning is unavailable or unaffordable,

17
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:01,320
this is a real problem.

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,120
In this programme, we'll be hearing about an innovative new idea for keeping houses

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,760
cool in one of the hottest countries on earth, India.

20
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,120
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

21
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,319
But before we hear more about this sweaty subject, I have a question for you, Neil.

22
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:27,920
Living in cities where summer temperatures regularly exceed 45 degrees Celsius, Indians

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,799
have been finding clever ways to keep their houses cool for over 5,000 years.

24
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,719
One of them is called Jali.

25
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,920
But what exactly is it?

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,079
Is Jali a tall house designed to reduce sunlight?

27
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:50,120
B, a honeycomb pattern used in windows, or C, a system for spraying cool water?

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,280
Well, I guess Jali is B, a honeycomb window pattern.

29
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,480
Okay, Neil.

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,480
We'll find out the answer later in the programme.

31
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:10,080
In May 2022, the temperature in Uttar Pradesh, the largest state in North India, reached 49.2 degrees Celsius.

32
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,080
Rochne DeVaca is a consultant for the Mahila Housing Trust, an NGO helping poor Indian women

33
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,879
to heat-proof their houses.

34
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:23,879
These women often work from home while their husbands are out in the heat,

35
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,879
working on construction sites.

36
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,879
Here, Rochne describes a typical house to BBC World Service programme People Fixing the World.

37
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,280
They live in a small one-bedroom house with no windows, no natural ventilation.

38
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:46,079
They don't necessarily have illegal electric connections, and even if they do, they don't have electricity 24 hours a day.

39
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:49,079
There are power cuts, especially in the summer months.

40
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:52,879
Many of them have tin roofs, which of course will really heat up.

41
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,680
Health gets affected because their health is affected.

42
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,879
Their livelihood gets affected because they're daily wage earners.

43
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,879
If you don't work, you don't earn.

44
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,879
Many of the houses have no window, so there's no ventilation.

45
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,879
The movement of fresh air around a space.

46
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:11,879
Air conditioning needs electricity, which most families can't afford,

47
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,680
and even those who can experience frequent power cuts.

48
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,879
Periods when the supply of electricity is stopped.

49
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,879
In this heat, sickness is common.

50
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:26,879
Often, the men can't work, which is a problem because they are the daily wage earners.

51
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,879
Someone who earns money on a day-to-day basis,

52
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,879
meaning that they will receive no money if they cannot work.

53
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:40,879
Families spend most of the day outside in the street, and at night, it's still too hot to sleep, even on the roof.

54
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:47,879
But fortunately, Rochne has been working on a clever, cool roof solution, white paint.

55
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:54,879
Painting reflective, anti-solar, white paint on the roof can reduce room temperatures by up to four degrees.

56
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,879
It may not sound like much, but it makes a big difference,

57
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,879
and allows families to work, cook, and even sleep inside.

58
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,879
His Rochne again, talking with the BBC World Service programme People Fixing the World.

59
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,879
This has honestly been the most successful of the technologies that we've adopted.

60
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:18,879
We started off by doing it in the city of Amdapur, but we've done it across other cities.

61
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,879
We've done it in Bangalore, we've done it in Jodhpur.

62
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:24,879
In fact, in Jodhpur, we've done it in an entire slum.

63
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:31,879
Mahila housing trust gets external funding and uses it to subsidise the cost of the paint,

64
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:36,879
meaning communities only end up paying 15-20% of the actual price.

65
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:42,879
Rochne's housing trust has been painting houses in cities all over India.

66
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,879
In Jodhpur, a city on the edge of the tar desert, they painted an entire slum,

67
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,879
a poor and crowded area of a city with very bad housing conditions.

68
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,879
What's more, the trust subsidises the paint, meaning they pay part of the cost,

69
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:00,879
so even the poorest families can afford it.

70
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,879
It's a great example of Indians skillfully finding ways of adapting to the heat,

71
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:08,879
a modern version of Jali, you could say.

72
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:11,879
So, what was the answer to your question, Beth?

73
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,879
Was my idea that Jali is a honeycomb pattern used for windows correct?

74
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:19,879
It was the correct answer.

75
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:26,879
Jali is a honeycomb design with many small holes set into wooden or stone windows.

76
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,879
The small holes keep out the sunlight and cool down the air coming in.

77
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,879
Okay, it's time to recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme,

78
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:40,879
starting with sweat, passing salty water through the skin to stay cool.

79
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,879
Ventilation is the movement of fresh air.

80
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:48,879
A power cut is an interruption in the supply of electricity.

81
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,879
A daily wage earner is a worker who earns money on a day-to-day basis.

82
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:57,879
A slum is a very poor and crowded area of a city.

83
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:01,879
And finally, if you subsidise something, you pay part of its cost.

84
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:04,879
Once again, our six minutes are up.

85
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:05,879
Goodbye for now.

86
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,879
Bye.
