5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,599
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,240
I'm Dan and hello, I'm Rob.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,320
In today's program, we're going to be looking at what our brains are doing

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,400
when we're using dating apps.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,120
Now, Rob, have you ever used a dating app?

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,920
No way I would never use one.

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,720
Mmm.

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,920
So, Rob, can you explain when talking about dating apps?

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,719
What we mean by swipe left and swipe right?

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,079
Ah, yes, these are not new words, but technology has given them new meaning.

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,600
To swipe is the movement of your finger on a smartphone to change the screen you're looking at.

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,079
So, imagine turning the page in a book.

17
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,920
Well, on a phone, you swipe.

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,560
In some dating apps, they show you pictures of people you might find attractive.

19
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,560
If you do like them, you swipe right.

20
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,719
If you don't like them, you swipe left.

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,719
We will dig deeper into this topic shortly, but first a question.

22
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:10,000
In the UK, approximately how many marriages start with the couple meeting online?

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,800
Is it A, 1 in 3, B, 1 in 4, or C, 1 in 5?

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,520
What do you think?

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,920
Mmm, well, all of those seem quite high to me, so I'm going to guess in the middle, 1 in 4.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,359
Well, we'll find out if you'll write later in the program.

27
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,840
Now, Alice Gray is a science communicator and blogger.

28
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,480
Recently, she was a guest on BBC Radio 4's Women's Hour program,

29
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,359
and she was asked about what goes on in our brains when we use dating apps,

30
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,400
compared to when we meet people in real life.

31
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,079
What difference does she say there is?

32
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,960
It was very easy to think that just with these instantaneous swipe left, swipe right,

33
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:55,839
that the process in our brain of how we pick out a suitable mate would be very different,

34
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:59,039
when actually it's really similar to how we do it in person.

35
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,799
So, she says that what goes on in our brains is actually very similar.

36
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,319
Online, we make decisions very quickly about who we like.

37
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,799
These decisions are almost immediate.

38
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:13,280
She used the adjective instantaneous for this.

39
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,959
So, we make these instantaneous decisions,

40
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,079
then choose to swipe left or swipe right.

41
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,080
In real life, we do the same thing.

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,200
We know almost immediately when we see someone,

43
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,360
if we find them attractive or not.

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,880
Although, of course, in digital dating, once you've swiped left,

45
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,439
you will never see that person again, and you won't have the chance to meet.

46
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,760
In the real world, you could meet someone you don't find attractive instantaneously,

47
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,439
and then get to know them and find that you do quite like them.

48
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,920
Yes, this is true, but then possibly they won't like you,

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,399
and then you have to deal with rejection.

50
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:53,439
Rejection is when someone doesn't find you attractive,

51
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,639
and they don't want to spend time with you or get to know you.

52
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:02,479
So, what's the difference in our brains between online rejection and real life rejection?

53
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,799
Here's Alice Gray again.

54
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:12,479
We see that a lot of the patterns associated with rejection in real life and rejection on

55
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,719
dating apps are similar.

56
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,840
It's just the exposure to the rate of the amount of rejection you get on dating apps is a lot

57
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,000
higher than the ones in real life.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,759
So, in real life, you'll have time to sort of compute the rejection,

59
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,479
get over a little bit, just yourself off and get on with it,

60
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,439
whereas the rate of rejection on dating apps is so high,

61
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,039
it's often hard to cope with one coming in after another.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,679
So, she says that our brains response to real life and online rejection is quite similar,

63
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,599
but in the digital world, you can be rejected many more times.

64
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,439
In real life, you have a bit more time to recover from the rejection,

65
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:51,680
to get over it, as she says.

66
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,439
You can dust yourself off, which is a way of saying that you think positively to make yourself feel better.

67
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,400
Imagine falling over on the ground.

68
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,920
When you get up, you might be covered in dust and dirt.

69
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,719
You need to dust yourself off to make yourself ready again before you carry on.

70
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,639
In the online world, though, you don't have that time.

71
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,520
Online dating apps can lead to many rejections,

72
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,480
and psychologically, that can be difficult to manage.

73
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,040
Another way of saying difficult to manage is difficult to cope with.

74
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,920
Well, we don't want you to reject us,

75
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,439
so time now to give you the answer to that quiz question,

76
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,439
before a recap of today's vocabulary.

77
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:38,240
I asked in the UK, approximately how many marriages start with a couple meeting online?

78
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,200
Is it a, 1 in 3, b, 1 in 4, or c, 1 in 5?

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,080
So I said b, 1 in 4, 25%. Was I right?

80
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,120
Sorry, Rob. The answer is a, 1 in 3.

81
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,160
Does that surprise you?

82
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,680
Yes, it does. I didn't think it would be that high.

83
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,040
It's a sign of the time, Rob.

84
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,880
Digital world, digital dating.

85
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,120
Let's have a look at that vocabulary.

86
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,000
Okay. Well, we started with the verb to swipe.

87
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,760
The movement of our finger on a smartphone or tablet screen

88
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,480
to indicate whether we like someone or not.

89
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,000
Swipe right for like.

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,759
Swipe left if you don't like.

91
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,800
Our decisions on whether we find someone attractive or not

92
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,959
are often instantaneous.

93
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,759
This adjective means immediate at once.

94
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,399
Rejection is when you let someone know that you are not interested in them.

95
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,039
You don't want to be romantically involved with them.

96
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,399
If you are rejected, you might need some time to feel better.

97
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,079
And for this, you can use the phrasal verb get over.

98
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,359
It can take some time to get over a rejection.

99
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:40,399
Yeah, I know.

100
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,599
Now, being positive and optimistic after a rejection

101
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:46,639
can be described as dusting yourself off.

102
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,680
But having many rejections can be difficult to cope with,

103
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,919
which means it can be difficult to manage.

104
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,759
Difficult to keep positive.

105
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,240
Well, we hope you don't swipe left on this program

106
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,919
and that you'll join us again next time.

Bye-bye.
