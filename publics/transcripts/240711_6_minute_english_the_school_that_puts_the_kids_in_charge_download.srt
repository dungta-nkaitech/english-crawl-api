2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Phil.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,480
And I'm Georgie.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,359
Some people remember their school days as the best time of their lives.

5
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,719
For others, it was the worst.

6
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,000
Did you enjoy school Georgie?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,800
Most of the time, yes.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,039
But there was one thing I didn't like.

9
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:29,039
The school rules.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,920
Luckily, that's not a problem for pupils at the Bamboo School in Thailand.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,240
Because there, the children, not the teachers, make the rules.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,519
Children at the Bamboo School are responsible for every part of running the school,

13
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:47,799
from buying food for the kitchens to disciplining fellow students,

14
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:50,159
and even hiring new staff.

15
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,920
It's a school run by students for students.

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes. In this programme, we'll be hearing about the Bamboo School,

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,320
a unique school where the children call the shots.

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,960
They have the power to make the decisions.

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,719
We'll also be learning some useful new vocabulary.

20
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:13,280
And before you ask Phil, yes, the Bamboo School really is made of Bamboo.

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,680
Sounds good, Georgie.

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,120
But first, I have a question for you.

23
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:24,439
The Bamboo School is a private school for poorer children who can't afford school fees.

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,319
Bamboo school children get educated for free,

25
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,000
but have to do something in return.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,879
But what?

27
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:40,840
Is it A, teach lessons, B, plant trees, or C, learn English?

28
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,479
Hmm, I guess they have to learn English.

29
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,840
Okay, Georgie. I'll reveal the answer at the end of the programme.

30
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,039
The idea behind the Bamboo School is simple.

31
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,880
Teaching children responsibility by letting them run their own school.

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,480
The school doesn't employ cooks, gardeners, or cleaners.

33
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,240
It's all done by the pupils.

34
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,360
Twice a week, children go to the vegetable market with a school officer

35
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,400
and buy food for all 150 students.

36
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,439
The prices are then carefully checked by other students like Nuneem

37
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,319
who manages the food accounts.

38
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,840
Here's Nuneem speaking with William Kramer,

39
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,560
reporter for BBC World Service programme People Fixing the World.

40
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,640
I am interested in accounting to begin with,

41
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,680
so I get excited by it.

42
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,759
When I actually get to do it, I enjoy it a lot,

43
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,879
since we are doing the actual job.

44
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,680
With this hands-on experience,

45
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,480
we see the schools real spending and the things we purchased.

46
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,719
So you went to a local school before, just in this area.

47
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,400
What are the differences between that school and this school?

48
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,439
My old school was like this.

49
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,000
It was just classes and then home.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,360
Here I get to try so many things,

51
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,159
get real-world experience,

52
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,080
and work on my leadership skills with my friends.

53
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,240
I've never had these opportunities before,

54
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,360
and the school has been amazing.

55
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,800
Nuneem says shopping at the market is a hands-on experience.

56
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,319
She's actively involved in doing something practical

57
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,840
rather than getting someone else to do it.

58
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
She enjoys managing the food accounts

59
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,759
because it's real-world experience.

60
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,000
The phrase real-world describes how the world works in reality,

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,199
rather than someone's idea of it, which might be unrealistic.

62
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,920
Children at the bamboo school get opportunities

63
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,560
to try something new and different outside the classroom,

64
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,800
increasing the chances they'll find something they're really good at.

65
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,520
Of course, there are some adults.

66
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,560
If we school these teachers,

67
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,920
but what's special is how children are trusted

68
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,599
and respond positively to that trust.

69
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,000
Here's reporter William Kramer, again,

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,319
speaking with Myra Anubi for BBC World Service Programme,

71
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:59,640
people fixing the world.

72
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,960
So just to be clear,

73
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,159
it seems like the grown-ups are still in charge in the classrooms,

74
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:08,039
but outside it's the kids who run stuff.

75
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,439
Yeah, I think that's broadly right.

76
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,680
And I think one of the things that's interesting about this school

77
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,360
is it manages to be quite conventional in some ways

78
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,800
and really innovative,

79
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,120
it will even radical in others.

80
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,920
At the bamboo school, the grown-ups,

81
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,480
another word for adults,

82
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,920
are still in charge in the classroom.

83
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,079
But it's the kids or children who run everything.

84
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:34,960
It's a radical idea and means that besides lessons,

85
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,280
there's lots of work to be done.

86
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,160
Children do two hours of community service.

87
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,320
That's work that is done without pay

88
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,160
to help people in the community every week.

89
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,040
Anyway, I think it's time to reveal the answer to your question.

90
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,400
Yes, we just heard that kids go to the bamboo school for free,

91
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,160
but do something in return.

92
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,680
But what?

93
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,080
Georgie guessed it was learning English,

94
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,120
which was the wrong answer, I'm afraid.

95
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,240
In fact, pupils at the school have to plant trees.

96
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,199
400 of them every year.

97
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:13,960
Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this programme

98
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,280
about a school where the kids or children call the shots.

99
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,560
A phrase meaning have the power to make the important decisions.

100
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,199
Hands-on experience means being actively involved

101
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,040
in doing something practical,

102
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,960
rather than just talking about it or getting someone else to do it.

103
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,879
The phrase real world is used to describe how the world really is.

104
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,800
Rather than someone's idea of it,

105
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,800
which may be unrealistic or untipical.

106
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,000
A grown-up is an informal word for an adult,

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,079
and a kid is an informal word for a child.

108
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,680
And finally, community service is work that is done

109
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,000
without pay to help people in a community.

110
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,120
Once again, our six minutes are up,

111
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,439
but remember to join us again next time

112
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,639
for more trending topics and useful vocabulary.

113
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,399
Here at six minute English, goodbye for now.

114
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,560
Bye.
