00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,040
Hello, welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,440
This is the program where in just 6 minutes we discuss an interesting topic

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,000
and teach some related English vocabulary and joining me to do this is Rob.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:24,800
Hello Neil.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,359
Now Rob, you seem like a happy chap.

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,199
What's the point of being miserable?

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,719
Well, there are many things that could make you feel down in the dumps,

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,519
a phrase that means unhappy, but what other things that keep you feeling happy,

13
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:39,039
cheerful and chirpy, Rob?

14
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,719
Oh, many things like being healthy, having good friends,

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,599
presenting programs like this with you, Neil.

16
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:49,920
Of course, but we all have different ideas about what makes us happy,

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,200
and that can vary from country to country and culture to culture.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,120
It's what we're talking about today.

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,960
Concepts of happiness.

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,079
Now Neil, you could make us even happier if you gave us a really good question to answer.

21
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:02,719
Here it is.

22
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,159
Happiness is an emotion that actually gets measured.

23
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,760
The World Happiness Report measures subjective well-being.

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,319
How happy the people are and why.

25
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,760
But do you know, according to a United Nations Agency report in 2017,

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,000
which is the happiest country on earth?

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,480
Is it A, Norway, B, Japan or C, New Zealand?

28
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,120
Well, I think they're all very happy places,

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,560
but the outdoor life of many New Zealanders

30
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,800
must make New Zealand the happiest place.

31
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,079
OK, we'll see.

32
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,079
I'll reveal the answer later on.

33
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,439
But now back to our discussion about happiness around the world.

34
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,920
Happiness can be hard to define.

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,280
Researchers suggested that while personal feelings of pleasure

36
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,560
are the accepted definition of happiness in Western cultures,

37
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,640
East Asian cultures tend to see happiness as social harmony,

38
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,640
and in some parts of Africa and India,

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,359
it's more about shared experiences and family.

40
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,799
It's something author and journalist Helen Russell has been looking at.

41
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,680
She's even created an atlas of happiness.

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,319
Her research focused on the positive characteristics of a country's population.

43
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,439
And guess which country she found to be one of the happiest?

44
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,240
New Zealand?

45
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,920
Actually, no, it was Japan.

46
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,319
Here she is speaking on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour program.

47
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,400
What concept or belief is it that promotes happiness?

48
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:26,799
Millennials and perhaps older people are better at remembering

49
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:29,199
Wabi Sabi, this traditional Japanese concept

50
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,439
around celebrating imperfection,

51
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,000
which I think is something so helpful these days,

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,439
especially for women.

53
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:37,919
It's this idea that there is a beauty in aging.

54
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,639
It's to be celebrated rather than trying to disguise it

55
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,239
or trying to cover up the scars.

56
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,319
Instead, you gild them with Kansuki.

57
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,719
If you break a pot instead of chucking it away,

58
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,639
you mend it with gold lacquer.

59
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,719
So the scars, rather than being hidden,

60
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,159
are highlighted in pure gold.

61
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,520
We all have laughter lines.

62
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,919
And rather than being ashamed of them,

63
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,680
there's something to be celebrated.

64
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,439
So in Japan, there is a belief that people should celebrate imperfection.

65
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:06,000
Imperfection is a fault or weakness.

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,879
So rather than hiding something that's not perfect,

67
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,400
we should celebrate it.

68
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,919
Getting old, for example, is not something to be ashamed of.

69
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,560
Don't hide your wrinkles or laughter lines.

70
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,039
These are the creases you get as your skin ages

71
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,120
or even you get from smiling too much.

72
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,080
Rather than spending time being ashamed of our faults,

73
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,800
we should accept what and who we are.

74
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,960
This concept is something that Helen feels

75
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,200
is particularly being celebrated by millennials and older people.

76
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,719
Yes, and Helen compared this with a process of Kansuki

77
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,759
where the cracks or scars on broken pottery

78
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,759
are highlighted with gold lacquer.

79
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,360
This is called gilding.

80
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,759
So we should highlight our imperfections.

81
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,439
This concept is something that maybe English people should embrace more

82
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,919
because, according to Helen Russell's research,

83
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,400
they are not a very happy population.

84
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,240
Here she is speaking on the BBC's Woman's Hour programme again.

85
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,039
What word does she use to describe people like me and you?

86
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:04,240
In England, what we have is jolly,

87
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,840
which many of us now associate with this kind of jolly hockey sticks

88
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,079
or a sort of made perhaps an upperclass thing,

89
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,360
but actually it's something that really plays through a lot of British culture

90
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,199
in a way that we may not think of so much.

91
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,240
So there's this sense that in a lot of our comedy,

92
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,160
in a lot of our approach to life, you just sort of,

93
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,519
you get out there, you go for a dog walk,

94
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,360
you have a boy like a boy with egg and soldiers

95
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,800
and we do sort of get on with things.

96
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,560
It's a coping mechanism, it's not perfect,

97
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,800
but it's worked for many Brits for a while.

98
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,800
In the past, we would use the phrase jolly hockey sticks.

99
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,480
A humorous phrase used to describe upperclass schoolgirls

100
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,000
in knowing enthusiasm.

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,800
But Helen now thinks jolly describes an attitude

102
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,199
that is used as a coping mechanism.

103
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,560
That's something someone does to deal with a difficult situation.

104
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,759
We smile, do everyday things like walking the dog

105
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,360
and just get on with life.

106
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,160
But I guess she means carry on without complaining.

107
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,160
Well, here's something to make you happy, Rob.

108
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,319
The answer to the question I asked you earlier,

109
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,199
which was, according to a United Nations Agency report in 2017,

110
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,040
which is the happiest country on earth?

111
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,279
Is it A, Norway, B, Japan or C, New Zealand?

112
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,040
And I said C, New Zealand.

113
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,800
The answer is A, Norway.

114
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,519
The report has been published for the past five years

115
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,199
during which the Nordic countries have consistently dominated

116
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,079
the top spots.

117
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:23,919
OK, now it's time to remind ourselves of some of the vocabulary

118
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:24,879
we've mentioned today.

119
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:27,039
We mentioned the phrase down in the dumps,

120
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,719
which is an informal way of describing the feeling of unhappiness,

121
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:32,319
sometimes with no hope.

122
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,079
The next word was imperfection, which is a fault or weakness.

123
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:38,959
You won't find any imperfections in this program, Rob.

124
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,759
Glad to hear it. Maybe we should guild this script.

125
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,120
To guild something is to cover it in a thin layer of gold.

126
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,360
We also heard about the word jolly, which means cheerful and happy.

127
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,480
And being jolly can be used as a coping mechanism.

128
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,759
That's something someone does to deal with a difficult situation.

129
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,639
If something doesn't go well, you just smile and carry on.

130
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,680
No, well, there's no need to do that in this program.

131
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,240
Now there's just time to remind you that we have a website

Goodbye.
