00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hello, this is 6-Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil and I'm Rob.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Do you know where the food on your plate comes from?

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Many people just assume that shops will always be ready with a cheap and plentiful supply.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But recently, a lack of certain foods in the UK, a situation known as a food shortage,

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
has left supermarket shelves empty of everyday items like eggs, tomatoes and cucumbers.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Some see these food supply problems, which were caused by unusually cold weather,

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
combined with rising energy prices, as a warning not to take a reliable supply of food for granted.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Like many countries, the UK imports much of its food from abroad,

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and for years has enjoyed a stable and affordable supply.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But with changes in the world economy, inflation and the effects of climate change,

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
how much longer will this continue?

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
In this programme, we'll be finding out, and as usual, learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
A reliable food supply is essential. In fact, there's an English expression about the dangers of not having enough food for everyone.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
We are only 9 meals away, but away from what Neil?

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Is it a revolution, b, anarchy or c, famine?

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I guess the expression goes, we're only 9 meals away from revolution.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Okay, I'll reveal the answer later on.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Besides difficulties in importing food, some countries are also producing less food than they used to.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
In the UK, many farmers are selling their apple orchards to housing developers,

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
rather than struggle with increasing production costs.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Here's Adam Layland, editor of the Grocer magazine, speaking with BBC Radio 4's The Food Programme.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The forecast is for the lowest levels of production since records began.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You think about how much investment there has been in glass houses and poly tunnels since 1985,

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
in a way that's transformed UK supply quite frankly.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The fact that this is what's being forecast is extraordinary.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Adam says that British food production is at its lowest since records began,

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
a phrase used to mark the point in the past when people started writing down an account of something

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
rather than just remembering it, so that the information could be used in the future.

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Production is decreasing despite improvements in how food is grown,

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
especially the use of glass houses and poly tunnels.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
A glass house is a large greenhouse, a building with glass sides used for the commercial growing of fruit and vegetables.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
A poly tunnel is a similar structure but made using plastic instead of glass.

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
However, it's not only Brits who are worrying about the production and supply of their food.

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Changes are happening all around the world.

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
When global demand for food outgrows supply, countries start competing with each other.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
According to Oxford University's Professor Charles Godfrey, an expert on the global food system,

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
we're now living in a less connected, less collaborative world,

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
a world which he says is deglobalizing.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
De-globalization involves sourcing food nearer to home, domestically or from neighbouring countries.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
While this sounds positive, Professor Godfrey is worried that deglobalization makes it harder to supply food to parts of the world

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
which cannot produce enough for themselves.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Here, he shares his concerns with BBC Radio 4's The Food Programme.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We think that in the next 30 or 40 years, we will probably see global demand for food rising 30 to 50%.

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
And I think a question is, should the UK be stepping up to help meet that demand,

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
given that we have a very sophisticated home agriculture?

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Well, you could argue completely the opposite that we live in a country where we are very deportful for biodiversity.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Perhaps we should produce less food here and use our land more for biodiversity.

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
My view is that if we plan our land use in a cany way,

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
one can produce more food and one can increase the biodiversity in the country.

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Professor Godfrey thinks only a globalised food system can successfully feed the world population.

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Countries that can produce food should be stepping up to meet demand.

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
If you step up to a situation, you start taking responsibility for doing something to improve things.

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
We need a balance between growing food and maintaining the Earth's biodiversity,

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
the number and variety of plants and animals living on Earth.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Depending on their circumstances, countries could use their land either to grow food or to promote biodiversity.

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But Professor Godfrey thinks both are possible if we are canny, an adjective meaning clever and quick thinking.

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Feeding the world is an urgent global challenge with serious consequences, as mentioned in that English expression.

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So maybe it's time you reveal the answer to the question, Rob.

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes, I asked you to finish the saying we're only 9 miles away from.

62
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And I guessed it was 9 miles away from revolution?

63
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Which was the wrong answer, I'm afraid.

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Actually, the saying goes we're only 9 miles away from anarchy.

65
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Hmm, I really hope not, but just in case let's recap the vocabulary we've learned starting with food shortage.

66
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
A situation where not enough food is produced.

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The phrase since records began shows the point in the past when people started keeping written accounts of events rather than just remembering them.

68
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
A glass house is a large greenhouse. That's a building with glass sides used for growing food.

69
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If you step up to a situation you start taking responsibility to act to improve things.

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Earth's biodiversity is the variety of plants and animals living in a natural environment.

71
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And finally the adjective canny means clever and quick thinking.

72
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Once again our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now.

73
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Bye bye.
