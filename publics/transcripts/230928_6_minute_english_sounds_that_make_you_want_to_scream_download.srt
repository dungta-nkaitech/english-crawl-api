6 Minute English from the BBC

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,919
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

3
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:11,759
I'm Neil. And I'm Phil.

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,160
Oh, what's that awful noise, Phil?

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,199
Sorry, Neil. I was biting my nails.

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,480
I know it's a bad habit.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,480
Oh, it sounds terrible.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,440
Sorry, Neil. Actually, it's not only you who find certain sounds irritating,

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,400
unpleasant, or even unbearable.

10
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:30,719
Whether it's someone biting their nails,

11
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,119
rustling a crisp bag, or scraping a knife on a dinner plate.

12
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,679
Some everyday sounds have the power to make us angry or upset.

13
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:41,600
There's even a name for it,

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,359
misophonia, also known as sound rage.

15
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,079
And it's more common than you might think.

16
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,159
According to some estimates, one person in five is affected emotionally by the coughing,

17
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:59,039
slurping, sneezing, and snorting sounds made by the people around them.

18
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,959
In this programme, we'll be finding out more about the medical condition

19
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:08,479
misophonia, and as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

20
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,879
But first, I have a question for you, Phil.

21
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:16,159
According to a recent survey by the American Journal Medical News,

22
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,400
which of the following did their readers find the most unpleasant sound?

23
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,840
Is it a bicycle brakes squeaking?

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,519
B. Nails scraping a blackboard, or C. A baby crying?

25
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,640
I guess it was squeaky bicycle brakes.

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,159
I really hate that.

27
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, Phil. We'll find out the answer later in the programme.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,879
For people suffering from misophonia, the specific sounds which cause them to become

29
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:50,640
emotionally upset, also known as triggers, often involve food and eating.

30
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,680
Just sitting down for dinner with their family can feel like torture.

31
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,840
Alana Tanzley-Hankock is a British clinical researcher who also suffers from misophonia.

32
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,879
Here she explains some of her triggers to BBC World Service programme, the food chain.

33
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,120
It's just any kind of inescapable repetitive noise,

34
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,639
we'll potentially cause a mesophonic type response in me that fight off-light,

35
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:22,959
and yet it's that immediate uncontrollable reaction that you get to the sound,

36
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,039
that is the most hard to explain and unusual, I think, because I don't think in modern day,

37
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,159
you don't really get many instances where you get a fight of flight responses,

38
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,959
not like we're frequently chased down by wild animals, and then to fill those from

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,519
pretty innocuous everyday sounds is the thing that takes its toll.

40
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:46,560
Certain sounds trigger a fight or flight response in Alana,

41
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,879
fight or flight refers to the way the human body responds to stressful or dangerous situations,

42
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,280
either by physically running away or staying to deal with the threat.

43
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,319
Normally these would be life-threatening dangers, things like a fire or an attacking wild animal,

44
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,800
but for mesophonia sufferers even innocuous or completely harmless sounds create problems.

45
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,480
That's right, Alana, for example, gets disturbed by helicopters flying in

46
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:21,599
the sky, and the fact that other people don't seem to bother it also takes its toll,

47
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:29,359
a phrase meaning causes suffering or pain. So what does it feel like to actually experience this

48
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:36,399
kind of stress in everyday life? Here's Alana again explaining her feelings to Ruth Alexander,

49
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:40,159
presenter of BBC World Service Program, The Food Chain.

50
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,159
It's not the same feeling, but it's the same response in terms of the immediacy and

51
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,800
inability to control it, as when someone tells you that someone close to you has passed away.

52
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:58,800
That feeling of utter sudden reaction, you can't control it, and then it lingers and carries on

53
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,319
for you. That immediate emotional response. Almost like a shock to the system.

54
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,519
Yeah.

55
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:12,879
Alana describes her misophonia as an uncontrollable and sudden emotional reaction,

56
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,759
as if finding out that a loved one has passed away.

57
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:23,759
Passed away is a polite euphemistic way of saying, died. She also describes it as a shock to the

58
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,839
system, a sudden and unpleasant change. Fortunately, mesophonia sufferers have developed some tricks

59
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,599
to help. Playing background music can disguise the sound of people sipping and slurping their food,

60
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:42,000
and clearly, honestly explaining what the condition is also helps people sympathise and understand.

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,239
But of course, some sounds simply are disturbing. For example, you biting your nails, Phil.

62
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:54,239
Okay, okay, I said I was sorry. Maybe it's time to reveal the answer to your question, Neil,

63
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:59,679
before you get more upset. You asked me which sound was voted the most irritating for

64
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,120
readers of the journal medical news. Right, and you guessed it was Bicycle Brakes squeaking,

65
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:12,160
which was the wrong answer I'm afraid, Phil. In fact, nails scraping a blackboard was voted the

66
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,079
most distressing noise, and I completely agree. Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned

67
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:24,399
from this program on misophonia, starting with trigger, something that causes people to feel

68
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:31,120
emotional distress or fear. Fight or flight refers to the natural human response to a threatening

69
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:38,079
situation of either running away or staying to face the danger. The adjective innocuous means

70
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:44,959
completely harmless. If something takes its toll, it causes suffering, damage or death.

71
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:51,279
Past away is a polite way of saying died. And finally, the phrase a shock to the system

72
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:58,559
means a sudden and unpleasant change. Once again, ask six minutes to wrap. Join us again next time

73
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:04,399
for more trending topics in use of the vocabulary. Here at six minute English. Goodbye for now. Goodbye.
