Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,320
And I'm Neil.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,400
The 20th of July 1969 was a big day in history. Do you know why, Sam?

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,760
Wasn't that when Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon?

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,880
Right. But it's often forgotten that some of the most dramatic photographs taken on the Apollo

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,039
Space Mission weren't of the moon at all. They were of Earth.

9
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:42,079
It wasn't until we went to the moon that we really saw the size of Earth's oceans and

10
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,480
named ourselves the Blue Planet.

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,880
Despite most of our planet being covered by water, the ocean remains a place of unexplored

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,719
mystery, of sea monsters like Moby Dick and the Kraken.

13
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:01,119
In this programme, we'll be diving into the deep seas, seeing some of its strange sites and,

14
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,319
as usual, learning some related vocabulary too.

15
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,280
But before that, I have a question for you, Sam.

16
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,120
You were right when you said that most of the Earth is covered by water.

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,359
But do you know exactly how much of the Earth's surface is ocean?

18
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,560
Is it a 50% B 60% or C 70%?

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,439
Well, it is called the Blue Planet, so I'll say C 70%.

20
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,359
Okay, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

21
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,560
The first thing to say about the deep ocean is that the rules of life down there are very

22
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,359
different from the rules on land. Sunlight cannot reach the very bottom of the ocean,

23
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,200
a place between two and three kilometres down known as the Deep Abyss.

24
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,000
So it is totally dark and extremely cold, and the weight of water creates massive amounts of pressure.

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,359
This extreme environment is stranger than fiction, and home to things which seem to be from another planet.

26
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:03,120
Things like hydrothermal vents, volcanic hot springs which break through the ocean floor.

27
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:09,199
Oceanographer Alex Rogers joined an expedition which discovered a hydrothermal vent

28
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:15,120
in the ocean near Antarctica. He told his story to BBC World Service programme Discovery.

29
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,400
Well, the first problem is actually finding them because they cover a very small area,

30
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,920
so it is literally like trying to find a needle in a haystack.

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,800
But when you do come across them, I mean the deep ocean is food limited,

32
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,439
so life is quite thin on the ground, and then suddenly your camera just stumbles into this area

33
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:43,520
where there is just abundant life all over the sea floor and around these vents.

34
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,400
Alex says that finding these small thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean is like finding a needle

35
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,200
in a haystack, an idiom meaning almost impossible to find because the area you have to search is so large.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,759
Because there's no sunlight on the ocean floor, it's hard for plants and creatures to survive,

37
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,800
so forms of life are thin on the ground. There are only a few of them.

38
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,560
Alex cannot find anything to film with his camera until suddenly he nears the vent

39
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,759
and sees plants and animals everywhere. Here there is more than enough or abundant life.

40
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,240
To picture a hydrothermal vent, imagine an underwater volcano,

41
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:34,080
billowing clouds of what looks like smoke heat the sea water to a temperature of 386 degrees C.

42
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,240
This creates a warm environment of all kinds of weird and wonderful creatures,

43
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:44,400
including vent muscles, chew worms and blind yeti crabs, so called because of their hairy claws.

44
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,840
Some of which get cooked because the water is so hot.

45
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,400
What's amazing is that while these vents may be as old as Earth itself,

46
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:59,360
they were only discovered in the 1970s. So are there more mysteries hiding in the depotion?

47
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,400
That's the question BBC World Services Discovery asked marine biologist,

48
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,480
Kerry Howell. Here's what she said.

49
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,719
I have absolutely no doubt that there is plenty more to discover down there.

50
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,519
It's really vast. It's quite hard to get your head around how vast the deep sea is and it is

51
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,000
most of our planet. We barely scratched the surface of exploration of this unique environment.

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,759
If you think that vents were only discovered in the 70s, there's great potential for a

53
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,879
Lord else to come. We've only been exploring this environment for the last 150 years.

54
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,399
I mean, before that we didn't think there was any life down there at all.

55
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,599
So it's a very young science is deep sea biology and so there's a lot more to discover.

56
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:50,000
In terms of ocean exploration, Kerry thinks we've only scratched the surface,

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,319
found out a little bit about something, but not enough to fully understand it.

58
00:04:54,319 --> 00:05:00,079
That's because the ocean is vast, extremely big. So vast, in fact,

59
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:05,120
that it's hard to get your head around it or difficult to really understand.

60
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,879
But how vast exactly, Sam, in my question I asked how much of the earth's surface is covered by water.

61
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,160
And I said it was C, 70 percent.

62
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,160
Which was the correct answer? Well, 71 percent to be precise, but either way it's hard to get your

63
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,319
head around or difficult to fully understand. Okay, we'd better recap the other vocabulary too,

64
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,639
starting with the idiom finding a needle in a haystack, meaning that something is almost impossible

65
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,560
to find because you have to search so widely for it. If something is thin on the ground,

66
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,959
there is very little of it, but if it's abundant there's plenty or more than enough.

67
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:49,519
When you only scratch the surface, you find out a little about something, but not enough to fully

68
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:55,279
understand it. And finally, vast is another way of saying extremely large, huge or enormous.

69
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:01,039
And like the vast oceans, our time is limited to just six minutes and it's up.

70
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:07,360
So join us again soon for more amazing adventures and of course, useful vocabulary here at 6 Minute

71
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,600
English. Goodbye for now. Goodbye.
