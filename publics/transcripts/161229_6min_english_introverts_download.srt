5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,640
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,839
And I'm Alice.

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,320
So Alice, how did you spend Saturday night?

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,879
Curled up on the sofa with a good book, you?

9
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:22,400
Oh, I went out on the town.

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,839
Met some friends, had a few drinks, then went on to a party.

11
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,800
Well, that illustrates the difference between us.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,839
You're an extrovert, and I'm not.

13
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,160
And where we are on the spectrum between introvert and extrovert

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,920
is the subject of today's show.

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,719
So, would you call yourself an introvert, Alice?

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,920
No, I'm an ambivirt, which means a mixture of introvert and extrovert.

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,799
Well, whichever you are, Alice, staying in on your own on a Saturday night is pretty boring.

18
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:52,079
Not to me.

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,040
And you shouldn't be so judgmental, Neil.

20
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,560
You're reflecting the general view that people seem to have these days,

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,359
that being an introvert is somehow less valuable than being an extrovert.

22
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,079
Introverts have many valuable qualities.

23
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,240
They're reflective, that means thoughtful, and have inner resources.

24
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,159
In other words, they don't rely on other people to enjoy themselves.

25
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,320
OK, well, if you're feeling reflective at the moment,

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,159
how about answering today's quiz question?

27
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:18,879
OK.

28
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,680
Can you tell me who first used the term extrovert?

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,000
Was it A, Sigmund Freud, B, Friedrich Nietzsche, or C, Carl Jung?

30
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,280
I think the answer is C, Carl Jung.

31
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,719
Well, we'll find out if you've got the answer right or not later in the show.

32
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,319
But before we get there, let's listen to Lisa Kanzig,

33
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,159
researcher and associate dean for William Smith College, New York State,

34
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,840
telling us a bit more about what being an introvert typically means.

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,560
Introverts are people of any age who really get their energy from within themselves,

36
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,159
and who often have sort of a running dialogue and their head going on,

37
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,399
thinking before they're talking like to have a little more time to think through things,

38
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,679
before they're commenting on them or answering a question,

39
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:07,679
need some time to recharge their batteries by being by themselves,

40
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:09,439
and enjoy having a lone time.

41
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:16,079
Lisa Kanzig there, who says that introverts think about what they're going to say before they say it.

42
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,519
Hmm, do you do that, Neil?

43
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:18,319
Nope.

44
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,120
Um, you should try it sometime.

45
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,840
Now, Lisa also talks about the different ways people recharge their batteries.

46
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,360
Introverts tend to need time alone to regain their strength and energy when they're feeling

47
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,520
drained or very tired, whereas extroverts often prefer to recharge by being with other people.

48
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,680
So introverts create their energy internally from within themselves,

49
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,400
and extroverts recharge from being with other people?

50
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,520
Exactly.

51
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,439
But in some situations, for example at school or in the workplace,

52
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,560
things can be made suitable for extroverts.

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,599
Extroverts typically love being with others,

54
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,639
in a big class or an open plan office, where there's a lot going on.

55
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,560
They enjoy the external stimulation,

56
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,120
but introverts can find these big noisy environments uncomfortable.

57
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,719
I can see that, and these days people are wild about group work and brainstorming.

58
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,960
Job ads frequently ask if you are a people person, a team player and so on.

59
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,080
That's right.

60
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,840
Introverts like to work alone or in small groups,

61
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,080
and need a quiet space to perform well.

62
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,319
Let's listen now to Dr. Peter Aloker, a researcher and psychologist in Kenya.

63
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,159
He's been working with introvert teenage mothers in Bondo,

64
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,800
who are returning to school after having their babies,

65
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,680
and schools are being asked to develop new strategies to support their learning.

66
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,040
Introverts might find it easier working in groups, but with smaller groups,

67
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,120
and they work in pairs with extroverts.

68
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,080
The teachers should design a classroom for all the students to contribute.

69
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,920
Wherever teacher is teaching a question in class, let them allow for wait time

70
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,360
for students to process the information before answering the question.

71
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,400
Just for people to think through the question.

72
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,440
Thinking, pairing and sharing.

73
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,240
Those three strategies will help the introverts to speak out.

74
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,120
Dr. Peter Aloker is talking about some very clever pairing there.

75
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,319
If you put two introverts together, they might not say anything.

76
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:31,600
An extrovert is likely to talk, but won't intimidate or overpower their introvert partner

77
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,360
as much as a large group would.

78
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,040
So the idea is that with fewer people in a small group or a pair,

79
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,720
the introvert will have enough time and space to express their ideas.

80
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,920
And because their ideas have been thought through or carefully considered,

81
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,720
their contribution is likely to be worth waiting for.

82
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,400
So think, pair, share.

83
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,920
Hmm, I like that.

84
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,680
Okay, so I think it's time to share the answer to today's quiz question.

85
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,639
I asked who first used the term extrovert?

86
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,840
Was it A, Sigmund Freud, B, Friedrich Nietzsche or C, Karl Jung?

87
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,240
I said Karl Jung.

88
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,560
And you were right, Alice.

89
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,439
So thinking things through really works.

90
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,800
Introvert and extrovert are the two basic personality types,

91
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,280
according to the theories of the 20th century Swiss psychiatrist, Karl Jung.

92
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,960
According to these theories, an introvert is a person whose interest lies

93
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,560
with their own feelings and thoughts in contrast to an extrovert

94
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,159
whose interest lies with other people and the outside world.

95
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:37,359
Okay, now let's hear the words we learned today.

96
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:52,000
