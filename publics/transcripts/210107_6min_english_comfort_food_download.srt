00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,519
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,640
And I'm Rob.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,519
I see you've been tucking into the biscuits again, Rob.

7
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:23,199
Well, I have Neil.

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,440
You can't beat a bite on a biscuit for a quick and easy sweet treat.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,960
They make me feel good, as long as I don't eat too many.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,359
So these are your edible comfortors.

11
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,280
A comfortor is something that makes you feel relaxed and feel good.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,840
Put another way, it is your comfort food,

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,480
which is what we're talking about in this programme.

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,799
Yes, like biscuits, comfort food is snacks and meals we like to stuff our faces with,

15
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,640
even if it's not always good for us.

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,840
We'll be discussing what actually makes us eat the stuff.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,040
But how about a question to feast on, Rob?

18
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,960
Patrick Bertoletti from the USA holds the Guinness World Record

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,159
for eating the most cream-filled biscuits in one minute.

20
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,799
But do you know how many biscuits he had?

21
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,599
Was it A2, B7 or C15?

22
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,480
Well, based on my biscuit-eating skills, I'd say 15,

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,280
it depends if he had to swallow them as well.

24
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,200
I'm not sure about that, but I'll reveal the answer later on.

25
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,600
Now, biscuits, ice cream, crisps and pizzas are all good examples of comfort food.

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,600
They're easy to snack on and they don't require many culinary skills.

27
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,760
Colony means related to cooking.

28
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,879
Well, that makes sense, but there must be something else that is urging us to seek out this

29
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:43,760
easy food.

30
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,000
According to psychologist Shira Gabriel, it's about memories and emotional experiences.

31
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:56,000
She spoke on the Food Chain podcast on BBC World Service and said her comfort food was macaroni

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,879
and cheese, something that brings back memories.

33
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,359
At some point in my life, those were foods that were made for me or shared with me by people

34
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,800
who cared about me and loved me and took care of me.

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,199
So because those are the foods that I had in my youth, I've associated them with

36
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:18,479
sort of those feelings of being taken care of.

37
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:20,239
And those associations are strong.

38
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,959
The associations we have with food are very strong.

39
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,919
And so by eating those foods, I'm able to activate those associations and give myself a rush

40
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,039
of positive feelings and a sense of acceptance.

41
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:39,839
So like so many of us, Shira associates eating certain types of food with past experiences

42
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:40,560
from her youth.

43
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,640
Associates means makes a connection in your mind with something.

44
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,280
And these connections between food and memories are very strong.

45
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,920
I know eating biscuits reminds me of eating them after school as a treat.

46
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,640
Well, Shira explains how we get a rush, a sudden and strong emotion of positive feelings

47
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,599
when these memories are activated by eating comfort food.

48
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,280
And it's not just memories that are activated, but also the emotions we feel as well.

49
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:15,439
If we felt happy the first time we ate the food, then hopefully we'll feel happy when we eat it

50
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,159
again. It's not always that simple, Rob.

51
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,439
Tucking into food that's high in carbohydrates, sugar or salt can make us feel guilty.

52
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:28,560
But we don't realise our minds are trying to trigger or start a positive emotion.

53
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,879
And it's making us eat that food to do so.

54
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,039
The Food Chain podcast explores this in more detail.

55
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,959
But what is interesting is that comfort food isn't universal.

56
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:42,400
Some languages don't have a comparable phrase.

57
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,239
It's a good point and something food writer Jenny Linford talked about.

58
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,079
Here's her theory on why that is.

59
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,479
Talking to Italian friends, I realised that no, they don't have a phrase for comfort food.

60
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,799
I think it's sort of irrelevant.

61
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,799
My Italian friends I asked about comfort food.

62
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,879
They said, they said, you know, food is always comfort and always pleasure.

63
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,560
And it's a joyful thing.

64
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,079
So it's just really interesting that, you know, this idea of comfort food is not universal.

65
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:11,359
It's actually quite nuanced.

66
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,439
So according to Jenny's Italian friends, all food brings comfort and pleasure.

67
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,680
Talking about specific comforting food is irrelevant.

68
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,800
It's not important or has no connection with the discussion.

69
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,959
Yes, she thinks the concept of comfort food is quite nuanced,

70
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,879
depending on where you are from, so there are small but important differences.

71
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,159
Well, maybe we should take comfort from or feel less bad about.

72
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:43,920
The fact that eating any kind of food can bring us joy, warmth, happiness and comfort.

73
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,920
So if you don't mind, I think I'll munch on another biscuit.

74
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,759
Are you trying to beat the record of Patrick Bertoletti from the USA?

75
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,519
Earlier, I mentioned he holds the Guinness World Record for eating the most

76
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,519
cream-filled biscuits in one minute.

77
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,680
But how many biscuits did he eat?

78
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,800
Was it A, 2?

79
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,840
B, 7 or C, 15?

80
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,120
I thought he ate 15. Was I right?

81
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,319
No, Rob. He scoffed only 7 in one minute, so maybe you can beat him.

82
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,720
But before you do, let's recap on some of the vocabulary we've been discussing.

83
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,400
Of course. We've been talking about comfort food, food that makes us feel good,

84
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,840
and we described it as a comforter, something that makes us feel relaxed and feel good.

85
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,119
We also mentioned culinary, connected to cooking,

86
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:35,599
and associated, which means made a connection in our mind with something.

87
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:41,759
Something that is irrelevant is not important or has no connection with the discussion taking place.

88
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,159
And something that is nuanced has small but important differences.

89
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:51,439
Finally, when you take comfort in something, you don't feel so bad because of something else.

90
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:56,239
Well, Neil, we're out of time, but let's take comfort in knowing that there are lots more

91
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,920

94
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,879
Thanks for listening and goodbye.

95
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,519
Goodbye.
