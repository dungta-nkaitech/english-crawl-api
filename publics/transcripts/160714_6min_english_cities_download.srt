00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,560
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,599
And I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,440
Have you ever played Sim's City Neil, the city building computer game?

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,920
Yes, but I wasn't very good at it.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,440
I didn't build enough houses which created a lot of homeless Sims,

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,039
those characters in the game.

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,600
And then I didn't deal effectively with a flood.

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,359
Really? Well, I suppose managing a city is quite a challenge.

12
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,920
Which is the subject of today's show, cities of the future.

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,000
An important subject as so many of us now live in urban areas.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,320
I want to start with our quiz question.

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,840
What is the percentage of the world's population that will be living in cities in 2050?

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,079
We are dealing with approximates here.

17
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,079
Is it a 10%, b 50% or c 70%.

18
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,399
I think that it's a 10%.

19
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,319
Well, we'll find out if you're right or wrong later on in the show.

20
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,840
Now, you've encountered a couple of issues that might face urban planners

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,679
when designing a city Neil, housing and dealing with a flood.

22
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:13,039
Can you think of any others?

23
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:17,519
Yes, having decent cycle lanes, good transport networks are very important.

24
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,640
Yes, indeed.

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,519
And if people could get around easily on foot or by bike or by public transport,

26
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,000
roads would be less congested or overcrowded and less polluted.

27
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,959
That sounds rather utopian to me, though.

28
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,480
A utopia is an imaginary place where everything is perfect.

29
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,280
But Copenhagen is pretty utopian, Alice.

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,799
The air is clean.

31
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,159
There are bike lanes everywhere.

32
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,840
That sounds fantastic.

33
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,599
But what about somewhere like Beijing with its constant smog

34
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,599
or air pollution hanging over the city?

35
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,920
A lot of people ride bikes there, too.

36
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,359
So which city is going to be the model for the future?

37
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,560
Maybe like the future Los Angeles in the movie Blade Runner,

38
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,200
you know, glittery high rises, gigantic neon billboards flying cars.

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,439
Well, today's Los Angeles has terrible urban sprawl and traffic problems.

40
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,640
Um, urban sprawl is the way a city spreads into undeveloped land around it.

41
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,240
Often without planning permission.

42
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,920
Hmm, Dr. Janice Pellman can explain why this happens.

43
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,960
She is the founder and president of the mega cities project

44
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,680
non-profit organisation in Rio de Janeiro,

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,879
and knows a lot about urban sprawl in Brazilian cities.

46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,039
People are coming massively into the cities which have no housing

47
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,319
that's affordable to them.

48
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,519
So they can't rent and they can't buy and they end up building their own

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,799
communities and houses on unoccupied land.

50
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,479
And these communities are becoming in some places.

51
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,879
The majority, not the minority.

52
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,400
And they're off the grid.

53
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,199
So they're not often serviced by either the social services,

54
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,599
but also many of them don't have water sanitation and electricity.

55
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,839
People migrate or move from the countryside to the city to get better opportunities

56
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:03,839
but end up with nowhere to live.

57
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:07,359
So they build their own housing on unoccupied land.

58
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,239
These shantytowns pour communities where the houses are built out of cheap materials

59
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,319
like corrugated iron and plastic sheeting are often off the grid.

60
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,679
Which means they don't have an electricity or water supply

61
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,080
or access to healthcare and education.

62
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,080
And these communities are growing so the problem's getting bigger.

63
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,159
So are there any solutions, Alice?

64
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,439
Well, it's all about improving the infrastructure.

65
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,200
That's the basic facilities a town or city needs, for example,

66
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,719
communication, transport, water and electricity.

67
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,920
But this shouldn't only mean improving housing conditions,

68
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,000
but also promoting education and employment among the inhabitants

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,760
and building better communities.

70
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,479
That sounds like a real headache for the urban planners.

71
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,919
You're right there.

72
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,959
And one thing urban planners are talking about at the moment

73
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,359
is creating smart cities.

74
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:01,199
John Rossant, founder and chairman of the Nonprofit Organization,

75
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,840
New Cities Foundation, explains what it is.

76
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,519
I think, you know, generally it's accepted that cloud computing,

77
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,599
ubiquitous internet, robust 5G networks, etc.

78
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,439
will will transform our cities, whether they're in the global south

79
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,759
or the developed world.

80
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,079
And, you know, where technology is really a game changer, I think, in urbanization.

81
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,720
John Rossant there, what's ubiquitous, Alice?

82
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,560
It means available everywhere.

83
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,040
So the idea behind smart cities is to use technology

84
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,959
to collect large amounts of data about how a city is performing.

85
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,120
And that will be a game changer,

86
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,240
significantly affecting the way our cities function.

87
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,600
Hope for the future, Alice.

88
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,960
Fingers crossed.

89
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,120
Now, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question, Neil.

90
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,240
I asked, what is the percentage of the world's population

91
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,439
that will be living in cities in 2050?

92
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,400
And remember I said we're dealing with approximates here?

93
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,560
Is it a 10%, the 50% or C 70%?

94
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,560
And I said a 10%.

95
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,680
Yes, and you underestimated their Neil.

96
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,160
The right answer is actually C 70%.

97
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,360
This, according to a report by the United Nations,

98
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,360
today 54% of the world's population lives in urban areas.

99
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,560
A lot really.

100
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:26,879
Yeah.

101
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,560
Well, I know we're running out of time,

102
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,040
so let me repeat the words we learned today.

103
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,280
They were congested.

104
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,519
Utopia.

105
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,519
Smog.

106
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,079
Urban sprawl.

107
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,240
Migrate.

108
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,240
Shanty towns.

109
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,160
Off the grid.

110
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:48,400
Infrastructure.

111
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,120
Ubiquitous.

112
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,199
Game changer.

113
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,280
