Hello, this is 6Mint English from BBC Learning English. I'm Rob.

5
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,120
And I'm Sam and I'm having a boiled egg for lunch today.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,800
I'll just sprinkle some salt on top there.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,280
Oh, you've spilled some salt on the floor, Sam.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,679
Quick, throw some over your left shoulder.

9
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,519
Throw salt over my shoulder. What are you talking about, Rob?

10
00:00:33,519 --> 00:00:35,920
It's bad luck to spill salt.

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,079
Oh, dear. It looks like Rob believes in superstitions.

12
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,920
Old beliefs which are based on magic and mystery rather than science.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,280
Many superstitions are connected to food, as we'll discover in this programme.

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,960
Right, like throwing salt over your shoulder to stop bad luck.

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,840
Oh, come on, Rob. You don't really believe that, do you?

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,760
Well, lots of people do believe food superstitions,

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,520
including otherwise rational, scientific people.

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,000
For example, have you ever blown out the candles on a birthday cake made a wish

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,439
or thrown rice over the bride and groom at a wedding?

20
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,280
Yes, to both of those. Maybe I'm more superstitious than I thought.

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,359
Well, before we find out, it's time for a quiz question

22
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,400
about another famous food festival, Halloween.

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,040
Ah, that's when people carve scary faces into pumpkins to frighten away evil spirits.

24
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,760
Yes, right. The tradition of carving pumpkins, or jack-a-lantons, as they're called in the United

25
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,680
States, started out as a Celtic festival in Ireland.

26
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,960
But it was the Americans who started using pumpkins.

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,840
So what vegetable did the Irish originally use to scare away ghosts?

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,600
Was it a turnips, beabotatos or sea squash?

29
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,760
I'll say B, potatoes.

30
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,400
Okay, Sam, we'll find out the right answer later on.

31
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,200
What's for sure is that cultures from around the world have been connecting food and magic

32
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,920
for thousands of years, and over time it's created some strange beliefs.

33
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:17,200
Here's food historian Tasha Marx describing one unusual superstition to BBC World Service programme

34
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,959
The Food Chain.

35
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,959
When you have superstitions and they sort of mix with science and health and medicine

36
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,119
and one of the examples of that would be something like garlic, which we all know garlic

37
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:33,839
words off vampires, but it's also been thought to ward off the evil eye.

38
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:40,399
And if you've come across the term the evil eye, it's a sort of blanket term that sort of applies to any bad luck.

39
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,760
Tasha says that garlic is believed to ward off vampires, meaning to repel or stop someone from

40
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,640
harming you.

41
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:56,240
According to this superstition, garlic also keeps away the evil eye, bad luck or magical spells

42
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,439
with the power to cause bad things to happen.

43
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,400
Tasha describes the evil eye as a blanket term for any bad luck.

44
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,879
Just as a real blanket covers the different parts of your body,

45
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,479
a blanket term is a phrase that's used to describe many examples of related things.

46
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:21,199
But food superstitions aren't only about bad luck, they also give our lives meaning.

47
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:28,479
Johnty Radhagopalan owns a tourist agency in Hyderabad, India, where she introduces visitors

48
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,120
to some of the city's food traditions.

49
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,000
Here she's talking with BBC World Services The Food Chain about a tradition

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,639
connected with the Hindu New Year.

51
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,840
Can you spot the different tastes she mentions?

52
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,240
Some of the traditions give you a little bit of a lesson,

53
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,159
like on every New Year and not the first January, not the Gregorian calendar New Year,

54
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,000
but the Hindu calendar New Year.

55
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:00,400
We would always be given a, it's a kind of a chutney which is made of all the five days.

56
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,439
So you have sour, you have sweet, you have something bitter in it and your mom would always give it

57
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,759
using that. This is what the rest of the year is going to be. You'll have happiness, you'll have

58
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,159
challenges, you'll have a little sadness, you'll have bitterness in your life, which I think is a very

59
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,719
nice tradition, it prepares you for everything in life.

60
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,519
At Hindu New Year, mothers give their children a special chutney, a mixture of fruit,

61
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,079
spices, sugar and vinegar. Did you spot the chutney's flavours, Sam?

62
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,279
There was sour, sweet and bitter.

63
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:36,399
Mothers tell their children that the coming year, like the chutney, will have its own flavours

64
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:43,039
both good and bad. That's why Johnty says that traditions can teach you a lesson.

65
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:48,159
They show you what you should or shouldn't do in the future as a result of experience.

66
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,479
What a lovely way to end our look at food superstitions.

67
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,799
Yes, maybe we should make chutney at Halloween instead of carving pumpkins or whatever vegetable

68
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:05,840
Irish originally used. Yes, in my quiz question, I asked you what vegetable was originally used

69
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,160
instead of pumpkins to scare away ghosts. I guessed it was bee potatoes.

70
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:19,439
Which was the wrong answer. In fact, turnips were originally used, so maybe Irish ghosts are

71
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:26,400
smaller than American ones. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned about superstitions.

72
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,279
Old beliefs which are connected with magic.

73
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:36,239
Garlic is supposed to ward off or keep away dangers like the evil eye, bad luck or harmful magic.

74
00:05:36,239 --> 00:05:43,199
The evil eye is an example of a blanket term. A phrase used to describe many examples of related

75
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,279
things. One Indian superstition involves chutney, a food mixing many flavours.

76
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:55,519
These traditions can teach you a lesson, show you how to act in the future based on your past experience.

77
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,000
Right, well that's all for this programme. Good luck with your language learning.

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,120
