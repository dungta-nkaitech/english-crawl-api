From BBC Learning English

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,720
Hello, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,919
Hello, I'm Dan.

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,240
Neil, aren't you going to say the welcome to 6-Mute English bit?

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,839
Hmm, maybe.

9
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,240
How's your mood today, Dan?

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,120
Feeling happy?

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,480
Oh, yes, very happy.

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,679
I've just had lunch.

13
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:28,719
What about you?

14
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:32,479
Well, to be honest, I haven't had the chance to eat yet,

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,640
and it's making me a bit grumpy.

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,079
Why haven't you eaten?

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,359
Well, I was doing some research for today's topic,

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:42,879
which is all about feeling angry when you're hungry.

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,239
You know what I'm talking about?

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,119
Oh, yes.

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,759
We're talking about being hungry.

22
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:49,519
It's quite a new word, isn't it?

23
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:52,159
A combination of hungry and angry.

24
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:54,480
Yes, and angry is our topic.

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,920
But before we learn more about it, here's today's quiz.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,480
English has quite a few words which are made by joining two different words together,

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,840
like, hungry, for example, brunch, motel, brexit.

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,159
What do we call these words?

29
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,120
Are they a suitcase words?

30
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,359
B, portmanteaux words?

31
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,920
Or C, backpack words?

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,640
Well, I think I know this one, so I'll keep the answer to myself.

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,280
I don't want to give away any spoilers.

34
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,640
What I do want to know is if hangar is a real thing

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,000
or is it just something that's been made up by grumpy people, like you?

36
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,799
Let's hear from Sophie Medlin,

37
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,120
who is a lecturer in nutrition and diatetics at King's College London.

38
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,480
Is hangar a real thing and where does the word come from?

39
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,840
We've long recognised that hunger

40
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,319
leads to irritability in science,

41
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,599
but the wonderful world of social media has merged the two words for us

42
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:55,280
and now we know it as hangar.

43
00:01:55,839 --> 00:02:00,159
So is hangar a real thing and where does she say the word comes from?

44
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,719
According to Medlin, it is a real thing.

45
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,000
She says that science has recognised that hunger leads to irritability.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,159
Irritability is a noun which means being easily annoyed,

47
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,680
not in a good mood.

48
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,879
And she says that it was the wonderful world of social media that joined the two words together.

49
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,959
She used the verb merge, merge meaning join together.

50
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:26,719
I know social media is responsible for many things,

51
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,039
but the word hangry actually appeared in the 1990s.

52
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,479
So a little before the arrival of social media.

53
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,319
But it's certainly true that social media has made it more prominent.

54
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,039
Me right now, hashtag hangry.

55
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,039
Let's listen to that clip again.

56
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,959
We've long recognised that hunger leads to irritability in science,

57
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,319
but the wonderful world of social media has merged the two words for us

58
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,919
and now we know it as hangar.

59
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,439
So now we know that hangar is a real thing.

60
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,599
Let's learn a bit more about it.

61
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,639
Why does it happen?

62
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:03,199
Why do we get angry when we're hungry?

63
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,039
Here's Sophie Medlin again.

64
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,319
As the blood sugar stroke we increase our cortisol in adrenaline,

65
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,560
so I fight or flight hormones.

66
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,639
And those have an impact on our brain.

67
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,199
And the neuropeptide, the things that control our brain, the chemicals in our brain,

68
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,840
the ones that trigger for hunger,

69
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,920
the same ones that trigger for anger and also for rage and impulsive type behaviour.

70
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,159
So that's why you get that sort of same response.

71
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:31,439
So it's all to do with blood sugar, isn't it?

72
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,199
Yep, it seems so.

73
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,879
When we're hungry, the level of sugar in our blood is lower,

74
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,240
and this causes an increase in particular hormones.

75
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,000
Hormones are the chemicals we make in our bodies that control certain biological

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,599
and psychological functions.

77
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,960
The hormones released when we are hungry are the same as our fight or flight hormones.

78
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,959
They are the hormones the body uses to prepare us to either fight or run away from a dangerous

79
00:03:58,959 --> 00:03:59,919
situation.

80
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,319
When these hormones are increased, it can cause anger and rage.

81
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,039
Rage is another word for being very angry.

82
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,159
And when we're angry we can behave impulsively.

83
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,199
Impulsive behaviour is when we do things without thinking, without considering the consequences.

84
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,279
So when we're hungry, this same emotions can run through us.

85
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:27,120
We can be angry and make poor decisions, and that is hangar.

86
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,759
Which brings us nicely to our quiz question.

87
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,120
What do we call words like hangar that are made by joining two different words together?

88
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,199
Now you said you knew the answer, Dan.

89
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:37,759
I did.

90
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,439
What was it?

91
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,879
Portmanto words.

92
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,399
And you are absolutely correct.

93
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,560
The answer is Portmanto words.

94
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,159
Congratulations if you knew that.

95
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,040
I did.

96
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,520
All right then, smarty pants, no need to boast.

97
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,400
I can see that you're still a little bit hangry, Neil.

98
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,840
Yes, I'm hungry, and that's making me angry.

99
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,560
But I think I can hold on to get through a review of the rest of today's vocabulary.

100
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,200
Well, we also had the noun irritability, meaning getting annoyed very easily.

101
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,200
Just like...

102
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,000
Don't!

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,280
Just don't.

104
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,720
Or I might just merge my fist with your face.

105
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,120
Ouch!

106
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,560
Yes.

107
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,120
Merge.

108
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,680
Meaning, join different things together.

109
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,720
I can see your fight or flight hormones are kicking in.

110
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,240
Those chemicals in the body that prepare us for aggression or escape.

111
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,800
I haven't quite reached rage yet.

112
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,879
This was another of our words, rage, and it means a state of being very...

113
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,399
Very...

114
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,519
Angry.

115
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,759
Our last word was impulsive.

116
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,959
This is an adjective to describe when we do things without really thinking about them.

117
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,720
We just do them without any control and without thinking about the consequences.

118
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,240
Now, I'm off.

119
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,120
I'm starving.

120
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,759
I've got to eat before I do something impulsive.

121
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,120
