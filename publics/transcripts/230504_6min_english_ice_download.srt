3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam. And I'm Neil.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Have you ever made a snowman or enjoyed a cold drink on a hot summer's day?

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Slippery in winter and cooling in summer, ice is made when water gets so cold it freezes.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But there's much more to ice than skiing holidays and cold drinks.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes, in an exciting discovery, the James Webb Space Telescope recently detected the coldest

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
ice is ever in outer space. Something NASA scientists think could explain the origins of life on Earth.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
For years, scientists have debated how life started on our planet.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Billions of years ago, long before the dinosaurs, animals or even plants existed,

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
the Earth had a watery environment of oxygen-free gases and chemicals known as the primordial soup.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It had the potential for life to develop, but something was missing.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So, how did we jump from the primordial soup to the first living plants, animals and eventually humans?

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And how does ice fit into the story?

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That's what we'll be finding out in this programme. And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
First, I have a question for you, Neil. We know ice is frozen water, but do you know the chemical symbol for water?

17
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Is it A, H2O, B, H02 or C, H2O2?

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Well, I really hope I get this right. I think the answer is H2O.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay, we'll find out or check if you're right later in the programme.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Astronomer Professor Melissa McLare worked with the NASA scientists who found ice on Europa, one of Jupiter's moons.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Here she explains to BBC World Service programme Science and Action, one theory linking ice to the beginnings of life on Earth.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
There's sort of these two alternatives for how you could have had life arise on Earth.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And one is that the very basic building blocks like water and methane and CO2,

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
like those molecules were definitely brought to Earth by ice in comets.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And maybe once they were on Earth, then they reacted with either geothermal heat or some kind of lightning strike to form more complex molecules.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Earth's primordial soup lacked the building blocks of life.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,000
A phrase describing the most basic biological and chemical units needed to support living things, elements like oxygen and carbon.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Professor McLare thinks these missing elements were brought to Earth in comets, large bright balls of dirt and ice which travel around the Sun in outer space.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's possible that when comets hit Earth billions of years ago, elements in the ice were scattered and struck by lightning,

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
a bright flash of light produced by electricity moving in the atmosphere.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
This resulted in the complex molecules needed for life on Earth.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Exactly how this happened is not known, but it involves biomolecules, molecules like DNA which are found in living things.

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Ice is not a biomolecule, but when it mixes with carbon, the atoms in ice molecules change to produce complex molecules.

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And that's when interesting things start to happen.

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Here's Professor McLare again explaining more to BBC World Services, Science and Action.

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If they have a carbon atom in them, they're complex organic molecules.

37
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So things like very simple alcohols like methanol or ethanol, like what you would drink are complex organic molecules.

38
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:15,000
And these molecules could react and start sort of a reaction chain that would eventually lead to something like a biomolecule.

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Ice can react with other elements to create organic molecules, for example the alcohol methanol.

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Here the adjective organic means related to living plants and animals.

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's different from how we use the word to talk about organic food, meaning food that hasn't been grown using artificial chemicals.

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:49,000
When these organic molecules met the primordial soup, so the theory goes, it produced a chain reaction, a series of chemical reactions in which one change causes another.

43
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It was this chain reaction which created the first living cells and eventually humans.

44
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Quite impressive for a little piece of frozen water.

45
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Speaking of water Sam, what was the answer to your question about the chemical symbol for water? I said it was H2O.

46
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Which was the right answer Neil.

47
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Each molecule of water and ice contains two atoms of H, that's hydrogen, joined to one atom of oxygen.

48
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from the programme starting with primordial soup.

49
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The environment on earth before there were any plants or animals which created the conditions for life.

50
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The phrase the building blocks of life refers to the most basic biological and chemical units needed to support living plants and animals.

51
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
A comet is a large object travelling in space which orbits the sun and has a bright burning tail.

52
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Lighting is a flash of bright light produced by electricity moving in the atmosphere.

53
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The adjective organic means relating to living plants and animals.

54
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And organic food means food which has been grown without using chemicals.

55
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And finally, a chain reaction is a series of chemical reactions in which one change causes another which in turn causes another.

56
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Once again our six minutes are up, goodbye.

57
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Bye bye.
