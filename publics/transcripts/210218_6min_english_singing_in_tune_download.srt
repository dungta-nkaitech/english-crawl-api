00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,280
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,559
And I'm Georgina.

7
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:24,160
Do-ray me fast, oh la-tito.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,199
Neil, what are you doing? Please stop.

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,920
Oh, hi Georgina. I'm practising my singing.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,120
I'm going to do virtual karaoke tonight with some friends.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,800
karaoke, really Neil? I heard you singing at the Christmas party and to be honest,

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,040
I think you might be tone deaf. You know, you can't sing in tune.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,200
Me tone deaf, I'm a nightingale. Listen, do-ray me.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,359
Between you and me, I think Neil is a bit tone deaf.

15
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,640
Wait until I tell him singing is the subject of this programme.

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,000
I heard that Georgina and I'm glad this programme is about singing because I love it.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,680
What I lack in ability I make up for in enthusiasm.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,960
I'm sure your karaoke buddies would agree with you, Neil.

19
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,599
That reminds me of my quiz question, Georgina.

20
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:17,040
As you know, I love karaoke, meeting up with friends to sing the words of our favourite pop songs

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,120
over a musical backing track.

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,079
karaoke was invented in Japan and its name is a combination of different Japanese words,

23
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,280
but what words? What is the meaning of karaoke?

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,200
Is it a machine voice, b, angry cat or c, empty orchestra?

25
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,400
Well, after listening to you sing, Neil, I'm tempted to say b, angry cat,

26
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,400
but that would be mean. So I'll guess a machine voice.

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,039
Okay, Georgina, I'll take that as a compliment.

28
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:50,879
But however good or bad my singing may be, there's no doubt that the act of singing itself is a

29
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,920
very complex skill involving a huge number of processes in our bodies and brains.

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,280
So what happens physically when we sing a musical note?

31
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,159
Usually something unexpected in your case, Neil.

32
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,640
So here's Maria Peeters, presenter of BBC World Service programme,

33
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,759
Crowd Science, to explain exactly what happens when we open our mouth to sing.

34
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,759
Listen out for the different body parts Maria mentions.

35
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,799
Vocal folds, also called vocal cords, are crucial here.

36
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:25,120
There are two flaps of skin stretched across your larynx that vibrate when you sing

37
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,599
and create a sound. The pitch of that sound, how high or low it is,

38
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,000
depends on the frequency of their vibration.

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,000
So if you want to hit the right note, they need to be working properly.

40
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,560
Important body parts needed to sing include the vocal cords,

41
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,640
a pair of folds in the throat that move backwards and forwards when air from the lungs moves over

42
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,680
them. The vocal cords are stretched over the larynx, also known as the voice box.

43
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,280
It's the organ between the nose and the lungs containing the vocal folds.

44
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,520
Singing is similar to what happens when you play a guitar.

45
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:04,719
The vocal cords act like the guitar strings to produce a buzz or vibration,

46
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,759
a continuous and quick shaking movement.

47
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,479
They vibrate over the larynx, which, like the body of a guitar, amplifies the sound.

48
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,399
So why do some people kneel, find it hard to sing in tune?

49
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,079
Is it because they cannot physically reproduce sounds,

50
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:24,560
or because they hear sounds differently from the rest of us?

51
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,959
Well, according to psychology professor Peter Fordrescher, it's neither.

52
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,359
He thinks that for poor singers, the problem is generally not in the ears or voice,

53
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,040
but in their brains, specifically the connection between sound perception and muscle movement.

54
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,720
So there's no hope for you?

55
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,080
Not necessarily. His professor Fordrescher encouraging the listeners of BBC World Services

56
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,880
crowd science.

57
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:53,840
I think there's reason for you to be hopeful, and however accurate or inaccurate your singing is,

58
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,920
one recommendation I would have for you is to keep singing, because there is evidence that singing

59
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:06,319
itself, whether accurate or inaccurate, has benefits socially and also for stress responses.

60
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,799
So good reason for you to keep it up.

61
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,439
Whether you're tone deaf or pitch perfect, there's lots of evidence for the health benefits of singing.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,800
For one, singing strengthens your stress responses.

63
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:24,079
Otherwise known as fight or flight, stress responses are the human body's reaction to external

64
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,560
threats that cause an imbalance, for example, pain, infection or fear.

65
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,120
From operatic power rotties to enthusiastic karaoke fans, Professor Fordrescher thinks singers

66
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,160
should keep it up. A phrase used to encourage someone to continue doing something.

67
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,079
So Neil, maybe you should keep singing after all.

68
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,480
You've changed your tune, Georgina. Maybe you'd like to come with me to karaoke next time we're

69
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,040
allowed out.

70
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:56,079
I think some practice would be a good idea, but first let's return to the quiz question.

71
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:59,839
You asked me about the meaning of the Japanese word karaoke.

72
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:06,800
Right. Does karaoke mean a, machine voice, b, angry cat or c, empty orchestra? What did you say?

73
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,879
I said a machine voice.

74
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,759
Which was the wrong answer?

75
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,599
karaoke actually means c, empty orchestra or in other words, music that has the melody missing.

76
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:20,240
Well, that's better than an angry cat, I guess.

77
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,199
Let's recap the vocabulary starting with tone deaf. A way to describe someone who cannot sing in

78
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,960
tune or hear different sounds. Like playing a guitar string, singers use their vocal chords,

79
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,120
a pair of folds in the throat that are stretched over the larynx or voicebox,

80
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,400
another part of the throat to produce a sound vibration, a quick shaking movement.

81
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,079
No matter how good or bad a singer you are, singing is good for your stress responses.

82
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,319
The fight or flight mechanism your body uses to regain inner balance.

83
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,039
So no matter what Georgina thinks about my singing, I'm going to keep it up.

84
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,719
A phrase used to encourage someone to continue their good performance.

85
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:05,519
That's all from us. Keep singing and join us again soon at six minute English.

86
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,719
Don't forget, we also have a free app you can download from the app stores. Bye.

87
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:11,360
Goodbye.
