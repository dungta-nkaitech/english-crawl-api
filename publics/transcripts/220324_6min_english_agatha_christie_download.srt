Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,199
And I'm Neil. Have you ever played the game Cludo Neil? The idea is that the person

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:29,760
playing detective discovers who the murderer is, where the crime took place, and which weapon was used?

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,120
The last time I played Cludo, it was Professor Plum in the library with the dagger.

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:43,920
Cludo is based on a very popular type of book, The Murder Mystery. Sometimes called a Who-Dunit.

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,200
A story about a murder which doesn't reveal who the murderer is until the end.

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:56,480
The Queen of Murder Mysteries is a British writer who was born in 1890. Her books are read all over

9
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:03,119
the world and have been translated into 103 different languages. Her name is Agatha Christie.

10
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:08,959
To date over two billion copies of her crime novels have been sold worldwide,

11
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:14,719
making her the best-selling novelist of all time, and the subject of this program.

12
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,840
Perhaps her best-known story is Murder on the Orient Express, a Who-Dunit featuring her most

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,120
famous detective, Aircule Poirot, who starred in 33 of Agatha Christie's books.

14
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,280
More about that later, but as usual, I have a quiz question for you, Neil.

15
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,240
Poirot may be Agatha Christie's most famous detective, but he isn't her only one.

16
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,719
So who is Agatha Christie's other fictional detective? Is it a, Hesi Wayne Throp,

17
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,480
B, Jessica Fletcher, or C, Miss Marple?

18
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,799
I'll guess it's A, Hesi Wayne Throp.

19
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,400
Okay, Neil. I'll reveal the answer at the end of the program.

20
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,680
As mentioned, one of Agatha Christie's most famous books is Murder on the Orient Express.

21
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,280
The story takes place on a train traveling from Istanbul in Turkey to Calais in Northern France.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,280
Listen as writer and Agatha Christie's superfan Harriet Gilbert summarises the story

23
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,319
for BBC World Service Programme World Book Club.

24
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,240
Poirot is on the train heading back home to England from Syria,

25
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,360
when two unconnected events take place. In a snowstorming Croatia,

26
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,080
the train comes grinding to a halt, and in one of the sleeping births,

27
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,840
a passenger is murdered. Since it's impossible for anyone to have reached the isolated snow-traped

28
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,920
train or to have escaped from it without leaving tell-tale footsteps in the snow,

29
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,119
the killer can only be one of the dozen people sharing Poirot's coach.

30
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:48,000
Yet as he starts to investigate, it seems that each of them has an alibi for the time of the murder.

31
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,239
Impossible. Well, Poirot certainly perplexed.

32
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:58,719
During a snowstorm, the express train comes to a grinding halt.

33
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:03,839
It slows down until it stops altogether. Then someone is murdered.

34
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,159
The murderer can't have escaped without leaving tell-tale footprints in the snow.

35
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,439
When something is described as tell-tale, it reveals information which allows a secret to be uncovered.

36
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:21,120
For example, lipstick on your husband's shirt could be a tell-tale sign he's having an affair.

37
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,800
The murder victim is found in bed, stabbed with an eye.

38
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:31,039
Poirot begins to investigate, but as he questions the train passengers one by one,

39
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:37,599
it seems that everyone has an alibi proof that they were somewhere else when a crime was committed.

40
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,000
Naturally, this leaves the Belgian detective perplexed or confused,

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,639
because something is difficult to understand or solve.

42
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,039
I won't spoil the story by telling you what happens next, Neil,

43
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:56,319
but let's just say that as usual, Poirot uncovers the murderer using his incredible powers of observation.

44
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,639
In her stories, Agatha Christie describes Erkule Poirot as a very strange or eccentric man.

45
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:08,000
The author, Sophie Hannah, has written several new Poirot stories based on the characters

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,039
invented by Agatha Christie before her death in 1976. Here she is describing more of her

47
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:20,560
Kule Poirot's strange characteristics to BBC World Service programme World Book Club.

48
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,199
There's the sort of outward things his appearance, which is very striking and very unusual,

49
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,759
and his sort of, I suppose, foibles is the best thing to call him.

50
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,160
You know, he likes neatness, he likes order, he approaches things very methodically,

51
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,040
he's very proud of his luxuriant moustaches, you know, all of that.

52
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,160
Sophie calls Poirot's unusual behaviour his foibles.

53
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,000
Habits or characteristics which are considered strange or foolish,

54
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,879
but which harm no one. Yes, unlike the fictional murderers he uncovers,

55
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:01,600
Poirot's foibles do know harm, but it makes me wonder if Agatha Christie's other famous detective

56
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,680
also had unusual habits. Well, first you'll have to reveal the answer to your quiz question, Sam.

57
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,920
You asked me for the name of Agatha Christie's other famous detective,

58
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,519
and I guessed it was a, Hetty Wayne Throck. Well, I'm afraid that was the wrong answer.

59
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,199
In fact, Miss Marple was the name of Agatha Christie's second most famous character,

60
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:29,039
although Hetty Wayne Throck is a fictional detective on TV. Well, now that we've solved the murder

61
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,399
and revealed the correct answer, let's recap the vocabulary starting with Who Done It.

62
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,639
A murder story which does not tell you who the murderer is until the end.

63
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,959
In The Who Done It, Murder on the Orient Express, the train comes to a grinding halt.

64
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:51,519
It slows down until it stops altogether. A telltale sign reveals hidden information

65
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,959
so that a secret can be revealed. An alibi is proof that you were somewhere else when a crime

66
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:02,719
was committed. To be perplexed means to be confused because something is difficult to understand.

67
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:08,240
And finally, someone's foibles are their strange but harmless habits or behaviour.

68
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,359
That's all for our six minute investigation into the mysterious world of Agatha Christie.

69
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,960
Goodbye for now. Goodbye.
