Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,120
This is the programme where in just 6 minutes we discuss an interesting topic

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,199
and teach them related English vocabulary and joining me to do this is Rob.

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,000
Hello.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,800
In this programme we're discussing Shardonfreude.

10
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,359
A hold on the ill, Shardonfreude.

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,120
That's a German word.

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,679
Shardonfreude is what we call a lone word.

13
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,159
A word from one language that is used in another language without being changed.

14
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,280
So you're right, Shardonfreude is used in English.

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,439
And am I right in thinking it describes the satisfying feeling you get when something bad happens

16
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:48,480
to someone else?

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,920
You're absolutely right, Rob.

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,359
Imagine you're in a queue at the supermarket and someone pushes in.

19
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,400
But when they got to pay their credit card doesn't work.

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,159
Think of the feeling you might get just seeing their misfortune.

21
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,600
Another word for bad luck.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,640
Yes, that is a very satisfying feeling.

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
But it's quite a mean feeling too.

24
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,959
It is, but we'll be discussing why that feeling could actually be good for us.

25
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,599
But first, let's set a question for you, Rob, and our listeners at home to answer.

26
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,000
This is about false cognates, also called false friends.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,519
Words that look the same in two languages but have different meanings.

28
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,840
So in English, we have the word rat, but what does that mean in German?

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,840
Is it A a big mouse?

30
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,799
B a noise or C advice?

31
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,439
That's tricky because I don't speak German.

32
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,719
So I'll guess and say B a noise.

33
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,039
Well, I'll have the answer later on.

34
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:44,079
Now let's talk more about Shardonfreude.

35
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,679
Enjoying someone's misfortune can certainly make us feel good.

36
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:51,039
And studies have shown this feeling is quite normal,

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,400
particularly when it happens to someone we envy.

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,920
If we see a wealthy celebrity suffering on a reality TV show

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,840
or are exposed for not paying their taxes, we feel good.

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,840
We say they've had their comeuppance.

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,560
That's a good word, meaning a person's bad luck

42
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,879
that is considered to be deserved punishment for something bad that they've done.

43
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,200
Let's hear from psychologist Wilco Van Dyke from the University of Leiden,

44
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,920
who's been talking about this on the BBC Radio 4 program all in the mind.

45
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,759
What have his studies found about our enjoyment of others misfortune?

46
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:30,000
People especially feel Shardonfreude when they think the misfortune is deserved.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,039
Then the question is where does joy arise?

48
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,279
Is this actually joy experienced towards the misfortunes of others?

49
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:41,919
Or is it also at least partly joy about a just situation?

50
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:47,119
Is that this misfortune of another actually appeals to a sense of justice?

51
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,159
That's also the reason why we like the misfortunes of hypocrites.

52
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,480
Because if they fall down, that also is a deserved situation.

53
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,360
Okay, so Wilco Van Dyke's studies found we get joy when someone's misfortune is deserved.

54
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,000
There is justice. In other words, the punishment someone receives is fair.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,280
And a just situation means a fair situation.

56
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,200
It's right. So I guess he's saying we're not just being mean.

57
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:21,519
Yes, and he also mentioned the type of people whose misfortune is just and deserved are hypocrites.

58
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,439
People who claim to have certain moral beliefs but actually behave in a way that shows they are not sincere.

59
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,759
The all in the mind program also heard from another expert on the subject,

60
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,000
author and historian of emotions, Dr Tiffany Watt-Smith.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,879
She talks about how Shardonfreude is a subjective thing based on our feelings,

62
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,000
and it's not as simple as deciding what is right or wrong.

63
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,840
What word does she use that means to express sympathy to someone about someone's bad luck?

64
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:56,560
We don't really experience emotions either or things. It's not black or white.

65
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,479
I think it's perfectly reasonable that we could genuinely commiserate with someone else's

66
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,360
misfortune at the same time as a terrible slice-smile spreading across our lips because

67
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,680
it's something that we've envied about them has turned out to not work out so well or whatever.

68
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,439
We have a much deeper ability to hold contradictory emotions in mind, much more so than

69
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,360
your average moral philosopher would allow.

70
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,639
Interesting stuff. She says when something goes wrong for someone,

71
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,680
we have the ability to commiserate with them. That's the word for expressing sympathy to someone

72
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,879
about their bad luck. So overall, Tiffany Watt-Smith thinks we have a range of emotions

73
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:38,480
when we experience Shardonfreude. But these are contradictory emotions, different and opposite

74
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:44,800
emotions. Maybe Neil, we should just be nicer people. No way. I loved seeing Germany getting

75
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,879
knocked out of last year's World Cup. Not really. Talking of Germany earlier, we mentioned false

76
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:56,720
friends and I asked, in English, we have the word rat. But what does that mean in German?

77
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:05,840
Is it A, a big mouse, B, annoyed, C, advice? And Rob, you said? I said B, annoyed. And that is

78
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:11,919
the wrong answer I'm afraid. The right answer is C, advice. Well done if you knew that at home.

79
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:18,719
Now on to the vocabulary we looked at in this programme. So today we've been talking about Shardonfreude.

80
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:24,399
That describes the satisfying feeling you get when something bad happens to someone else.

81
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,359
And that's an example of a lone word, a word from one language that is used in another language

82
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:35,120
without being changed. In this case, German. We mentioned comeuppance, which describes a person's

83
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,160
misfortune that is considered to be deserved punishment for something bad that they've done.

84
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,519
Next we mentioned justice. That's the punishment someone receives that is fair for what they've done.

85
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:51,680
And the word just describes something that is fair and right. Hippocrits are people who claim to

86
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,959
have certain moral beliefs, but actually behave in a way that shows their not sincere.

87
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:02,160
And finally, commiserate is a word that means expressing sympathy to someone about their bad luck.

88
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,760
That's the verb. The noun form is commiseration.

89
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,160
Well commiserations Neil, we run out of time for this programme. See you soon. Goodbye.
