From BBC Learning English

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,080
Hello, welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Rob.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,199
And I'm Neil.

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,920
Now, Neil, can you remember the first time you've ever used the World Wide Web

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,240
or as we often call it the internet?

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,679
And what you used it for?

10
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:28,240
Oh, that's a good question. I do remember.

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,159
And...

12
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:31,839
Well, nothing really changes, does it?

13
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:33,759
Because I've looked up pictures of cats.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,519
Cats.

15
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:36,960
Very useful.

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,359
Anyway, do you think the internet has generally been positive or negative for the world?

17
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,079
Wow. Now that is a big question.

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,359
A huge question.

19
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,959
I don't know if I can answer that.

20
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:47,519
Hmm.

21
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:50,159
Well, one person who perhaps can answer it

22
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:51,840
is the man who invented it,

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,879
British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee.

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,320
We'll find out what he thinks has become of his child shortly.

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,320
But before that, a question for you all.

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,480
When did Berners-Lee first suggest the idea for what would become the World Wide Web?

27
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,079
Was it a 1985, b 1989, or c 1991?

28
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:13,680
Hmm.

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,599
Tricky, but I think it's earlier than people think,

30
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,200
so I'm going to go for 1985.

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,400
Well, that was a long time ago,

32
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,000
but we'll reveal the answer a little later in the programme.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,200
I think it's true to say that the internet has been one of,

34
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,240
if not the most important technological developments,

35
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,560
perhaps of all time. Would you agree, Neil?

36
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,719
Well, it's hard to imagine living without it.

37
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,240
Not impossible, but not nearly as convenient.

38
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,800
These days, we take the internet for granted.

39
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,880
We share our lives on social media,

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,120
and not just with friends and family.

41
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,520
And that isn't always a positive thing,

42
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,039
according to the father of the internet, Tim Berners-Lee.

43
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,759
In a recent BBC tech-tent programme,

44
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,239
he talked about his concerns with the internet,

45
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,039
and particularly the companies that control its information.

46
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,039
Companies which he calls internet giants.

47
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:07,679
What does he say he thought these companies had to do?

48
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,759
Initially, I felt the main thing that internet giant had to do was to just be neutral.

49
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,840
Just be a platform and humanity.

50
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,319
Once connected by technology, we'll do wonderful things.

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,200
And clearly, it doesn't work like that.

52
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,719
If you connect humanity via Wikipedia,

53
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,120
then they do produce in general wonderful things.

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,719
If you connect people by social networks where they have anonymity,

55
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,960
then it can bring out the very nastiest of people.

56
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,160
So, what did he say he thought these internet giants had to do?

57
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,480
He said that he thought initially that they just had to be neutral.

58
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,280
Initially, means at first, in the beginning.

59
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,879
And it also suggests that later he'd changed his mind.

60
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,639
Anyway, he said that he thought they just had to be neutral.

61
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,359
Neutral here means that they didn't need to do anything.

62
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:58,000
They didn't need to control the internet or information.

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,759
He thought it would be a tool to connect people and ideas and information,

64
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,039
and it would be wonderful.

65
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,039
But it's not all good, is it?

66
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,000
No.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,560
He does say that giving people access to sources of information is generally a good thing.

68
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,840
But that when it comes to social networks, social media,

69
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,919
people have anonymity.

70
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:16,800
Anonymity?

71
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,519
Yes.

72
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,760
It means that on the internet, people can hide their true identity or personality.

73
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,760
Some people write things that they would never say to someone in person,

74
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,920
because they think there will be no consequences.

75
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,040
Berners-Lee says anonymity can bring out the nastiest side of people.

76
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,080
People saying horrible and terrible things to each other.

77
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,160
Berners-Lee does have some suggestions for how this could be changed,

78
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,040
and it's based on the idea of likes and shares, which he calls Qdos.

79
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,320
What's his suggestion?

80
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,879
The different social networks, the different platforms,

81
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,239
are in different situations.

82
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,840
In some cases, they have acknowledged that there's an issue.

83
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,639
I think they realize that the issue could perhaps be hugely mediated by tweaking the way the thing works,

84
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:06,879
by changing the way retweets or propagated or changing the way people get Qdos.

85
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,919
Give them all Qdos for being constructive, for example.

86
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,120
So how does he think companies could address the problem?

87
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,919
Well, he says that some of the social networks have agreed

88
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,959
that there is a problem, and they know what could improve it.

89
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,599
He didn't use the word improve, though, did he?

90
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:24,240
No. He actually used the rather formal verb,

91
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,000
ameliorate, which means to improve or make something better.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,599
So how does he suggest the problem could be ameliorated?

93
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:35,519
By tweaking the way in which people give or receive Qdos.

94
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,279
Tweaking means making a small change to the way something works.

95
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,319
Much of what happens on the internet is driven by our desire to get likes and shares.

96
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,360
This is the Qdos that Berners-Lee talks about.

97
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,800
He feels that tweaking this could lead to a better experience.

98
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,879
For example, getting more Qdos for constructive or positive actions.

99
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:59,519
Interesting, but I wonder who would decide if something is constructive?

100
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,879
Well, that's another big question for another day, I guess.

101
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,240
For now, though, let's have the answer to our small question.

102
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,680
In what year did Berners-Lee present the idea for what would become the World Wide Web?

103
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:17,920
The options were A, 1985, B, 1989, or C, 1991.

104
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,400
It was, in fact, 1989.

105
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,960
Now, before we go, let's have a quick recap of today's vocabulary.

106
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,840
Initially, means at first in the beginning, and then we had neutral.

107
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,480
Hmm, in this case, it meant not controlling or not taking any action to control.

108
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,199
Then there was the noun anonymity, which is the state of having a hidden identity or personality.

109
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,039
Next, to ameliorate a situation is to make it better.

110
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,519
To tweak something is to make a small change to the way something works.

111
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,279
And then we have, of course, Qdos.

112
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:54,319
Qdos is praise and appreciation for something you've done.

113
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,599
Well, Qdos to you, Rob, for today's programme. Thank you very much.

114
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:00,159
Well, thank you, Neil, and thank you everyone for listening.

115
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,159
That's all we have time for today.

116
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:05,360
But you can find us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.

117
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,279
And of course, our website, bbclearningenglish.com.

118
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,000
Bye for now.

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,279
Thanks for joining us and goodbye.
