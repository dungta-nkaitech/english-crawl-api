00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,160
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,719
And I'm Alice. So Neil, the subject of today's show is superheroes.

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,640
Who's your favourite? Spider-Man.

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,719
He's cool and funny and he can spin webs and jump off skyscrapers.

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:27,359
Well, my favourite superhero is Ms. Marvel.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,320
I've never heard of her. And I'm a bit of an expert on comic book superheroes.

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,719
Well, a growing number of people from ethnic backgrounds are getting bored of all these

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,840
white male superheroes they can't relate to.

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,960
And their hungry for characters a little closer to home,

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,200
or relevant to their own lives.

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,359
So what's Ms. Marvel's superpower?

16
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:52,480
She's a shape shifter, which means she can change shape and become anything she wants.

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,960
But she's also just Kamala Khan, an average teenager from New Jersey

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,280
who happens to be Asian and a Muslim.

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,439
Sounds good. But I think it must be time for today's quiz question, Alice.

20
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,480
Okay, here it is.

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,640
What is the name of the new character that replaces Tony Stark as Iron Man?

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:17,760
Is it A. Miles Morales, B. Reweigh Williams, or C. Jane Foster?

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,280
I'm going to say A. Miles Morales because he sounds like a man.

24
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,920
Hmm, well, we'll find out later on in the show whether you got the answer right or not.

25
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,719
Now, I have another question.

26
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,240
What are the rules for achieving superhero status?

27
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,240
Superman is an alien.

28
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,480
Ms. Marvel has alien genes, and Spider-Man and the Hulk are both contaminated or poisoned

29
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,599
by radioactive substances that change their DNA.

30
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,599
What about Batman and Iron Man?

31
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,719
They're just ordinary guys with a lot of money who use technology to create superpowers for themselves.

32
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,840
Good point.

33
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,000
There don't seem to be any hard and fast or clear rules,

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
but these special powers, whether it's being able to fly or change shape or spin webs,

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,120
they allow the characters to do good in the world.

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,920
And that's a big theme across all comic books.

37
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,960
That's true, but times have changed in comic books these days,

38
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,960
often blur the line between right and wrong, making things unclear.

39
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,000
Superheroes don't always do the right thing and struggle with everyday problems like you and me.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,080
Let's hear more about imperfect superheroes from Jason Dippmer,

41
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,439
Professor of Political Geography at University College London.

42
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:33,759
They imbued these characters with real human problems.

43
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,920
So Peter Parker had just sort of one problem after another.

44
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,599
The Fantastic Four was a family, and they bickered and fought,

45
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,920
reading, so we're a couple, and then they got married, and that had like never happened in

46
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,359
superhero comics, so these people had lives that others could relate to.

47
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,759
So publishers like Marvel Comics imbued or filled their characters with human problems.

48
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,319
I can't imagine a character like Captain America worrying about small things or bickering with his

49
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,560
wife. And bickering means arguing about things that aren't important.

50
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,319
Well, like you said earlier, times change, Neil.

51
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,359
These days, the publishing houses want to attract a more diverse or varied readership.

52
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,080
Teenagers, women, ethnic minorities who want superheroes they can relate to,

53
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,920
facing issues from racial discrimination to bickering at home.

54
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,800
I know that women are indeed interested in superheroes because they've been appearing in movies

55
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,280
and on TV, but the world of comic books has always been a bit of a guy thing.

56
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,080
Well, it isn't. Women read them and in some places women work in them.

57
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,320
In Japan, for example, we have the manga. These are Japanese comic books for adults and children.

58
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,560
And guess what? There is a strong tradition of female illustrators there.

59
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,280
Really?

60
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,519
Yes. Let's move on now and listen to Dr. Kasey Brienza, sociologist at City University in London,

61
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:56,639
talking about manga.

62
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:04,079
One of the really interesting things about producing comics in Japan is that it's one of the few

63
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:13,840
kind of autonomous careers that women can have. And so Japan has many, many female comic book artists

64
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,319
who write both for men, women, boys and girls. And in the United States and in Britain,

65
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,439
female comic book artists are far and away a minority.

66
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,920
Dr. Kasey Brienza there. So she says female comic book artists are common in Japan,

67
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,480
but are a minority in the US and the UK.

68
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,000
It's particularly interesting that being an artist is an autonomous career,

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,560
meaning you have the freedom to make your own decisions. And apparently this is not common for

70
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,680
women in Japan.

71
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,120
And do you know who draws Miss Marvel? Is it a woman?

72
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,639
No. Miss Marvel is drawn by a man, the Canadian comic book artist Adrian Alphona.

73
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,759
But we're running out of time, so let's go to today's quiz question. I asked you,

74
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:07,279
what's the name of the new character that replaces Tony Stark as Iron Man? Is it A, Miles Morales,

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,759
B, Revy Williams or C, Jane Foster?

76
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,679
And I said Miles Morales.

77
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:21,599
And you were wrong, Neil. I'm sorry. The answer is Revy Williams. Marvel Comics has recently

78
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:27,279
diversified its characters to look more like the world we know today, including the addition of female

79
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:33,919
African American college student Revy Williams as Iron Man. Marvel has also given Thor's hammer to a

80
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:40,080
woman, introduced a black Hispanic Spider-Man called Miles Morales and created Kamala Khan,

81
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,439
a Muslim superhero otherwise known as Miss Marvel.

82
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:47,280
Very interesting. Now, let's remind ourselves of the words we learned today.

83
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:55,520
Close it to home. Shape shifter. Contaminated. Hard and fast. Blur.

84
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:03,839
Inbued. Bicker. Diverse. Manga. Autonomous.

85
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,680
And that's the end of today's Six Minute English. Don't forget to join us again soon. Bye bye.
