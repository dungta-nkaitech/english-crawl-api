00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And I'm Sam.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Calettes, collie shoots and tender stems. Can you guess what they are Sam?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Hmm, well they sound like the names of pop groups to me.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Ah yes, well, good guess. But in fact, the truth is even stranger. Their varieties of vegetable

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
being grown in the UK by a new generation of fruit and veg growers.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Forget traditional carrots, leeks and potatoes. Vegetables today are getting a modern makeover

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
thanks to breeding methods which mix two different plants to produce something completely new, known as a hybrid.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The hybrid collette, for example, is a mix between kale and a Brussels sprout.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Tender stems are a mix of traditional broccoli with the type of Chinese kale.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And collie shoots are small green stems with mini-collar flower heads shooting out the side.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
These exciting new varieties, which look very different from traditional vegetables,

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
are increasingly popular on farms, in shops and in restaurants across the UK.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
In this programme, we'll hear all about these new vegetables and the people who grow, cook and eat them.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And as usual, we'll be learning some new vocabulary as well.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Sounds good Sam, but first I have a question for you.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
One of the first hybrids on sale in the UK was named Cotton Candy, because of its sweet caramel flavour.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
But is Cotton Candy a cherry, be a strawberry or see a grape?

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Well, if it's sweet, I guess it's a strawberry.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay, well, we'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The collettes, which Sam mentioned earlier were introduced to the British market in 2010 under the name Flower Sprouts.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
They were advertised as a healthy vegetable that could be cooked or eaten raw and became extremely popular.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The inventor of the collette is Jamie Clackston, one of the UK's top seed producers in head of plant breeding firm,

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Toza Seeds.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Here's Jamie chatting with Leyla Kazim, presenter of BBC Radio 4's, the Food programme.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And so how did the idea of the Kayla even come about in the first place?

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We do quite a lot of blue sky breeding where we just try wacky stuff and see what happens.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Were you looking at a sprout and a cow and going, I can do something inside of this?

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
A whole of the Brassica family, those are all Brassica Rollerati, Brussels sprouts, kails, cauliflower and just thinking how long it takes to get the food.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Just thinking how obviously we knew they would cross-porn on it easily and produce unusual veg.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And we were just kind of thinking we need to create something that's more modern, you know, Brussels sprouts and kails are very traditional.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Through our few things into gathering and mixing potency, what comes out?

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Jamie says collettes with a result of blue sky breeding.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:19,000
This phrase comes from another expression, blue sky thinking, which means using your imagination to try to come up with completely new and original ideas.

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Some of Jamie's plants were wacky and unusual in a funny or surprising way.

38
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But this was all part of the fun of breeding and growing new vegetables.

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Jamie threw his ideas into the mixing pot.

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
A place where different ideas mingle together to create something new.

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hybrid vegetables add exciting new colours and tastes to traditional veg, such as the deep purple leaves of rainbow kale or the sweet nutty flavour of a collyshoot.

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:00,000
As a result, they have become fashionable with many British chefs, including Jack Stein, son of TV chef Rick, who runs a restaurant in the seaside town of Padstow in Cornwall.

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Here's presenter of BBC Radio 4's The Food Programme, Laila Kazim again, talking to Jack about what makes a great new vegetable.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,000
When you're looking at new varieties of veg, are there any particular traits that you're looking for that will help in the kitchen?

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I mean, obviously it's going to be down to taste really, and it's going to be down to what it looks like on the plates.

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The colour, the texture, the taste, all these things are really important.

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
But I think novelty and things like the kaleettes were great. I mean, they were originally called flower sprouts.

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Jack names two features of great hybrid veg. First, there's the texture, the way something feels when you touch it.

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:52,000
And second, novelty, the fact that something is new and unusual. Added to the surprising way many new varieties look, and of course they're great taste.

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Modern vegetables have provided a welcome new addition to traditional British cooking.

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And don't forget the unusual names too, Sam, like the cotton candy fruit I asked you about in my question.

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes, I guessed cotton candies were a new variety of strawberry, was I right?

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You were wrong, I'm afraid, Sam. In fact, cotton candy is a variety of grape, so called because they're very sweet and taste like you've been to the fairground.

54
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this program about new vegetable hybrids, plants which have been grown by mixing two different plants together.

55
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Blue sky thinking involves using your imagination to try and think up original ideas.

56
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Something which is unusual in a funny or surprising way could be described as wacky.

57
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The mixing pot is a place where different ideas or ingredients get mixed to create something new.

58
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
And texture means the way something feels when you touch it.

59
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And finally, novelty is the quality of being new or unusual.

60
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
If you've enjoyed this program, why not take the taste test by cooking some hybrid vegetables yourself?

61
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And remember to join us again soon for more trending topics and useful vocabulary here at 6 Minute English.

62
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Goodbye for now.

63
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Bye bye.

64
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Bye.
