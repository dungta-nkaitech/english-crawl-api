00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,880
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,280
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,320
Do the names Lion's Mane or Turkey Tail mean anything to you, Neil?

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,679
Lion's Mane and Turkey Tail sounds like things you might find in the zoo.

6
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:26,080
Oh, good guess.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,359
But they are actually the names of mushrooms.

8
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,920
Lion's Mane is a white, hairy mushroom found across Asia.

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,399
And Turkey Tail is a brown, fan-shaped fungus, which looks a bit like, well, a Turkey's tail.

10
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,879
But if you haven't already heard these names, you probably will soon,

11
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,480
because these mushrooms are becoming popular as medicine.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,719
Throughout history, our ancestors used mushrooms as food,

13
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,399
but also as medicine for physical problems and mental illnesses like depression.

14
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,199
In the 21st century, this medicine is being rediscovered and marketed.

15
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,679
Today, mushrooms are big business.

16
00:01:05,679 --> 00:01:13,439
In 2021, the global medicinal mushroom market was valued at $26 billion and growing.

17
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,920
But how real are the supposed health benefits of mushrooms?

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,960
In this programme, we'll be finding out, along with some useful new vocabulary.

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,439
But first, I have a question for you, Beth.

20
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:32,159
Neither plant nor animal, mushrooms are mysterious and amazing things.

21
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,599
But which of the following statements about mushrooms is actually true?

22
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,879
A. Most mushrooms are poisonous.

23
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,359
B. Some mushrooms can fly.

24
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,400
Or C. Some mushrooms glow in the dark.

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,039
Hmm, I think some mushrooms glow in the dark.

26
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:53,439
Okay, Beth, we'll find out if that's true at the end of the programme.

27
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:59,039
Scientific researcher Dr. Emily Leaming has been studying the medicinal properties of mushrooms

28
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,879
for King's College London.

29
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,280
She shared her discoveries with Sheila Dillan,

30
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,959
presenter of the BBC Radio 4 programme The Food Chain.

31
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,800
So I think these mushrooms are very much having a moment right now.

32
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,919
They're kind of labelled as sort of superbrained drugs.

33
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,680
So things are going to potentially help with lessening anxiety,

34
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,000
improving potentially depression.

35
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,439
It's very much about these mind benefits that we're seeing,

36
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,240
the labels on the claims getting better.

37
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,840
What do you think of those claims?

38
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,759
I think that at the moment they seem to be quite overblown.

39
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,840
We don't have as much evidence on humans at all. It's very limited.

40
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,879
Dr. Leaming says that right now medicinal mushrooms are having a moment.

41
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,639
If something is having a moment, it's very popular or fashionable at a particular time.

42
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,319
Mushrooms are popular due to the claims about what they can do.

43
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,959
For example, reduce depression.

44
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,679
A claim is a statement that something is true,

45
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:59,119
although it cannot be proved and others might not believe it.

46
00:02:59,119 --> 00:03:03,199
Dr. Leaming thinks some of the claims made about mushrooms are overblown,

47
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,039
exaggerated to see more significant than they really are.

48
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:09,919
The problem is that to sell something as medicine,

49
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,039
you need scientific proof of its benefits.

50
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,959
You might feel less stressed after drinking chamomile tea,

51
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,439
but that doesn't mean you can legally call chamomile a medicine,

52
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,120
even though it's been used for centuries to help people relax.

53
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,319
However, that hasn't discouraged many from experimenting, especially young people.

54
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,159
Emma Clifford works for food research organization Mintel.

55
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,479
Here she discusses young people's attitude towards mushrooms for BBC Radio 4 program, the food chain.

56
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:46,879
Lots of people absolutely want there to be scientific proof for health claims on food and drink,

57
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:54,639
because there still is a fair amount of skepticism, distrust, and general confusion around functionality.

58
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:00,159
However, I also think that for many consumers, the medicinal properties of certain ingredients

59
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,439
based on natural and holistic ancient wisdom may be just as compelling,

60
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,639
if not more so than knowledge based on modern science and clinical trials.

61
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,439
And I think many people, young people in particular,

62
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,240
they're just really intrigued to give these ingredients a go.

63
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,439
People want scientific evidence that what they are taking is good for them,

64
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,040
but many are also convinced by ancient wisdom,

65
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,120
a phrase referring to knowledge, philosophy, and beliefs that existed before the arrival of

66
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,319
Christianity in Europe. Ancient knowledge about medicinal plants has been kept alive,

67
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,840
and some trust this wisdom more than modern medicine.

68
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,280
Young people are especially prepared to give mushrooms a go.

69
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,519
If you give something a go, you try doing something to see if you like it.

70
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,639
They are intrigued about mushrooms, they find them interesting and want to know more,

71
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,959
which is not surprising given some of the amazing things mushrooms can do.

72
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,240
I think it's time to reveal the answer to your question, Neil.

73
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,280
I guess one of the amazing things some mushrooms can do is glow in the dark.

74
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,160
That was, Beth, the correct answer.

75
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,160
About 80 species of fungi are bioluminescent, meaning they really do glow in the dark.

76
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,319
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this program,

77
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:25,040
starting with having a moment, a phrase meaning to be popular or fashionable at a particular time.

78
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,280
A claim is a statement that something is true or a fact, although it cannot be proved and others

79
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,040
might not believe it. The adjective overblown means exaggerated to seem bigger or more important

80
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:44,000
than it really is. In Britain, the phrase ancient wisdom describes pagan knowledge, philosophy,

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,879
and beliefs that existed before Christianity.

82
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,360
If you give something a go, you try doing something to see if you like it.

83
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,400
And finally, when someone is intrigued by something strange or mysterious,

84
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,040
they're very interested and want to know more.

85
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:04,000
Join us next time for more new useful vocabulary here at 6 Minute English.

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,960
Goodbye for now.

87
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,600
Bye!
