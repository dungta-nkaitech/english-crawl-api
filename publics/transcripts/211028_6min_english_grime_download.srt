Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,320
And I'm Sam.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,519
In this 6 Minute English, we're talking about music.

6
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,400
What sort of music do you like listening to, Sam?

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,679
Well, I wouldn't say I have one specific type.

8
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:32,719
My taste in songs is more eclectic.

9
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,039
A word that describes taste, which includes a wide variety of styles.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,280
Well, in this programme, we're talking all about grime,

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,920
a style of music which originated in London,

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,000
specifically in the Tower Blocks of East and Southeast London.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,679
Yes, the artist's predominantly young black men

14
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,519
and often cite the decaying tower blocks they grew up in

15
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:59,359
as an inspiration for the urban style of music.

16
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,320
Well, before we continue talking about grime music,

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,319
I have a question for you, Sam.

18
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,519
Storm Z is one of the most famous grime artists.

19
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,319
But what is his real name? Is it A?

20
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,959
Michael Amari, B? Martin O'Whosu, or C?

21
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,079
Marvin Apaya.

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,519
I think I might know this one.

23
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,760
I'll say A. Michael Amari.

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,599
We can find out if you're right at the end of this programme.

25
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,719
For many people, knowing the origin of a type of music

26
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,239
helps them to understand more about the style and lyrics.

27
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,000
Here's writer Jude Jorson, talking with BBC journalist Andrew Mar,

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,120
about his experience growing up on a station

29
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,359
Southeast London on the BBC Radio 4 programme, Start the Week.

30
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,519
Yes, I live like an estate.

31
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,640
This is an annually near crystal palace.

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,400
And for me, growing up, the experience was like literally

33
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,600
you can only see the different cultures and peoples

34
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,760
that live within this estate.

35
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,240
And it was around the age of about seven or eight.

36
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,200
That's when things for me and my particular state started to get a bit more contentious

37
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,599
with the other people that are moving in.

38
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,879
Kids are coming off age, becoming more free and venturing out and around the estate.

39
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,480
And please, kind of harassing.

40
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,520
But you've got different cultures knocking into each other

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,200
and then please knock into everybody else.

42
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,520
Yeah.

43
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,800
So Jude Jorson describes his upbringing.

44
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,160
He used the word contentious, likely to cause or create an argument

45
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,920
to describe life on the estate.

46
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:43,680
Yes, and he said the kids were coming of age,

47
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,960
meaning transitioning from a child to an adult.

48
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,800
In his interview, he goes on to say how a teacher gave him the advice

49
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,360
that if he ever got stabbed, not to remove the knife as he would bleed to death.

50
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,320
He says that at the age of 14 when he was told that he felt grateful

51
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,640
and that the teacher was looking out for him.

52
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,040
But in hindsight, questions why a teenager should receive that information.

53
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:13,120
What this does is give us an insight into life and the background that led to some people,

54
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,920
like Stormzy, creating grime music.

55
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,080
He says that it started off in the bedrooms and basements of tower blocks and homes

56
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,280
in these areas of London, with many artists work being broadcast on pirate radio

57
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,840
stations.

58
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,919
That said, for some people, this type of music represents something different.

59
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,240
There are some who think the hard-hitting lyrics and strong beats glorify violence.

60
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,520
They see it as an aggressive and violent form of music.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,280
However, Jude Jorson, speaking with Andrew Mar on the BBC Radio 4 program start the week,

62
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,960
has a different interpretation of what grime music is all about.

63
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,599
I describe grime as like a soulful shell.

64
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,560
There's a necessity in literally getting all of this content out of yourself.

65
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,359
And one of the most predominant grime artists,

66
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:04,639
Wiley was basically the first person that created this sound.

67
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:10,479
It's like 140 beats per minute because that's such a raw tune.

68
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,319
But the chorus literally chants like there are lots of signs in life,

69
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,319
some that you may not realise.

70
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:22,159
And for me, I was listening to that as like an 11-12 year old and is very existential.

71
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,439
He used the word predominant, which describes the strongest or most important thing,

72
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,280
to describe the artist, Wiley.

73
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,640
That's who Jude Jorson says was the first person to create the grime sound.

74
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,400
He also used the verb chants, sings repeatedly over and over,

75
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,439
to talk about the chorus from one of Wiley's songs.

76
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,520
And he described the experience of listening to it as being existential,

77
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,439
relating to human existence.

78
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,799
Which inspires me to go and listen to some grime music after today's show.

79
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:03,919
But before we do, I ask you a question about the real name of the grime artist Stormzy.

80
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:11,120
You did and being a fan of many different music styles, I think I know this one.

81
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,279
I said, A, Michael Amari.

82
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:16,879
You really do know your music, Sam. You are right.

83
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:22,800
In fact, his full name is Michael Ebenezer Quadro Amari Urujo, Jr.

84
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,240
I think I'll have to make the next question much harder for you.

85
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,839
So before we leave today, let's recap the vocabulary, starting with eclectic.

86
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,399
A word which describes taste, which includes a wide variety of styles.

87
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,279
Contentious means creating or causing arguments.

88
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,000
We also have coming of age transitioning from child to adult.

89
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:51,680
Predominant refers to something that is the strongest or most important.

90
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,120
Chance is a verb which means sing or repeat the same thing over and over again.

91
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,719
An existential means relating to human existence.

92
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:04,959
Well, we certainly learned a lot about grime music and its origin.

93
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:10,639
There are lots more six-minute English programs to enjoy on our website at bbclearningenglish.com.

94
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,159
Thanks for listening and goodbye.
