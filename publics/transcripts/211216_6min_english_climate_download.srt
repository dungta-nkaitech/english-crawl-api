00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,359
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,039
And I'm Sam. It's hard to feel positive when you hear about climate change, don't you think, Neil?

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,080
Yes, according to the UN's COP26 conference,

7
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:31,359
we're heading for a catastrophic global temperature rise of three degrees by the end of this century.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,439
Fires are blazing from the Amazon to the Arctic, and even if we stopped burning all fossil fuels

9
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:42,879
tomorrow, it would take decades to feel the effects. It's all very depressing.

10
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,879
I agree, but there is hope that catastrophes can be avoided, thanks to some amazing ideas by some

11
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,320
very imaginative scientists. In this programme, we'll be discussing Geoengineering,

12
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,759
the name for a collection of new scientific plans to remove carbon from the atmosphere

13
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,600
and stop global warming. Also called climate repair,

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,200
Geoengineering is still in the experimental stages. Some technologies are controversial because

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,319
they interfere with natural climate systems, and others may not even be possible.

16
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:20,560
One ingenious idea to call the planet involves spraying diamond dust in the sky to deflect the

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,600
sun's rays. Amazing, but before we find out more, I have a question for you, Sam.

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,240
Spraying diamond dust in the sky sounds futuristic, but in the 1960s, there was a band who wrote a

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,400
song called Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, but which band? Was it A, the Rolling Stones, B,

20
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,800
the Beach Boys, or C, the Beatles? I think most people would say the answer is C, the Beatles.

21
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,320
Okay, we'll find out the answer later in the programme. Now throwing diamonds in the sky might

22
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:56,559
sound crazy, but it's far from the wildest idea scientists have thought up to decarbonise the planet.

23
00:01:56,559 --> 00:02:02,479
Oceans hold 16 times more carbon than the Earth's atmosphere, and could hold even more.

24
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,400
If the fish and plankton living there had more available nutrients, food that animals and plants

25
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:15,039
need to grow. But how to provide these nutrients? Believe it or not, one answer involves, you guessed it,

26
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:21,359
whale poo. David King chairs the Centre for Climate Repair at Cambridge University.

27
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:27,199
He explained how his unusual idea would work to BBC World Service programme Discovery.

28
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,719
Imagine now a pod of whales all coming up and pooing in the same area of the ocean.

29
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:41,039
This could be in an eddy current, and it could lead to something like 10,000 to 20,000 square

30
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:48,159
kilometres being covered in nutrients, including iron. And as we know from observations today,

31
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,079
within three months that region is chock-a-block with fish.

32
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,280
Whales live in groups called pods. They swim up to the ocean surface to poo, and this poo can

33
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,919
be spread in an eddy, a large current of water moving in a circular motion, like a giant whirlpool.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,079
As a result, huge areas of the ocean are covered in nutrients and become chock-a-block with fish,

35
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:19,759
an informal way to say full of fish. Another original idea being explored is rock weathering.

36
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,560
Carbon is slowly locked into rocks and mountains over thousands of years by natural

37
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,439
geological processes. This literally groundbreaking idea would speed up the process by locking

38
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,039
carbon into rocks that have been dug up through industrial mining.

39
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:42,000
Listen as Geochemist, Professor Rachel James explains her idea to BBC World Services Discovery.

40
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:50,879
For every ton of rock that's mined, only a very tiny proportion, a couple of grams of that

41
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:59,520
is actually diamond. The rest of it is effectively waste. So, mind-based material is potentially a

42
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,800
really great source of material that could be repurposed for enhanced rock weathering, and I think

43
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:11,760
that's really good because it creates a circular economy. Mining for diamonds creates tons of waste

44
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:19,280
rock, which could be used to capture carbon. Professor James wants to repurpose this rock to find a new

45
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:26,160
use for it. Not only would this lock more carbon, it also creates a circular economy, an economic

46
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,960
model which involves sharing, reusing, and recycling products for as long as possible to avoid waste

47
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,960
and to reduce levels of carbon. While these ideas might sound strange, they're all theoretically

48
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,440
possible, and looking to science for positive solutions reminds some people of the early ecological

49
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:52,000
movement which started in the 1960s, and now 50 years later is being taken seriously.

50
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,480
Speaking of the 1960s, it's time to reveal the answer to my question, Sam.

51
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:04,399
Yes, you asked me which 60s band wrote the song Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. I said confidently

52
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:10,480
see the Beatles. Which was, of course, the correct answer. John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote the song

53
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,879
in 1967, but I doubt even they could have predicted that it would inspire a scientific idea to save

54
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:23,120
the planet. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from the program, starting with nutrients,

55
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,279
food that plants and animals need to grow. Whales and other sea mammals like dolphins live in a group

56
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:36,399
called a pod. An eddy is a large current of water moving in a circular motion. Chock a block

57
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:43,279
is an informal way to say full of something. If you repurpose something, you find a new use for it,

58
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:48,639
the use other than what was originally intended. And finally, the planet's future might depend

59
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:55,199
on the circular economy, an economic system which values sharing, reusing and recycling over

60
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,559
consumption and waste. These incredible scientific innovations might mean that time is not

61
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:06,959
yes up for planet Earth, but time is up for this program. Join us again soon for more trending topics
