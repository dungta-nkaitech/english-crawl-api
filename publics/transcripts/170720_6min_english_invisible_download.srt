00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,679
Welcome to 6 Minute English, the program where we explore an interesting topic

6
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:20,400
and bring you six items of useful vocabulary.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,039
I'm Neil.

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,080
And I'm Dan.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,000
Now, Dan, have you ever wanted to become invisible?

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,199
Invisible.

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,800
Oh, impossible to see.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,079
Of course, who hasn't?

13
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:31,839
Well, how about this?

14
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,159
Most of us think we are, in fact, invisible, at least some of the time.

15
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:41,119
We'll be looking at the Invisibility Cloak Illusion in this program.

16
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:42,240
Fascinating.

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,000
And in that phrase, we heard our first three words.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,960
Invisibility, the state of being invisible.

19
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:54,560
A cloak is a long piece of material worn like a coat around the shoulders.

20
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,760
And the third word in that phrase, an illusion, is something that seems real, but isn't.

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,359
Okay, question time.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,840
Which of these stories features an Invisibility Cloak?

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,439
Is it A the Hobbit?

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,560
B Harry Potter?

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,879
Or C the Invisible Man?

26
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,719
I know they're all connected to Invisibility, but I'm going to say

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,400
A the Hobbit.

28
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,400
Okay, we'll reveal the answer later on.

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,920
Now, let's hear more about this Invisibility Cloak Illusion.

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,200
What's the theory, Neil?

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,680
Right, imagine you're sitting in a crowded train.

32
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,879
People are busy looking at phones and books, but they're also looking at each other.

33
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:35,120
They're people watching, as we call it.

34
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,640
Yes, yes, I do that.

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,000
I do it a lot, if I'm honest.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,960
So, where does the Invisibility part come in?

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,599
A team of scientists from Yale University did some experiments on this.

38
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,560
Commenting on the research here is neuroscientist Dr. Catherine Love Day

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,159
from Westminster University.

40
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,479
What did the Yale team find?

41
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,599
So this study, they asked people that they first

42
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,039
were doing an online survey and then they asked people after they sat in a canteen.

43
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:05,519
How much they were watching somebody and how much they thought those people were

44
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,959
observing them.

45
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,159
And there was always a mismatch.

46
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,560
People always thought they were more observational than the people who were watching them.

47
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,319
So, people think they observe others more than others watch them.

48
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,120
Everyone thinks they aren't observed very much.

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,159
It's almost as if they're invisible to others,

50
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,719
or wearing an invisibility cloak.

51
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:32,319
And the difference between how much they are actually being watched and think they're being watched

52
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,319
is what she calls a mismatch.

53
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,800
It's the difference between two things.

54
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,040
There are two things which don't match.

55
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,960
In other words, it's not true that people aren't watching us,

56
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,000
which is why the idea of having an invisibility cloak is just an illusion.

57
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,199
This next bit is interesting.

58
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,759
Two people were asked to wait in a room.

59
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,960
Then they were each asked to make two lists.

60
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,599
One, what they noticed about the other person,

61
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,400
and two, what they thought the other person noticed about them.

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,439
So, list one was always longer than list two.

63
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,479
Not only that, but there was also an important difference in the content of the lists.

64
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,080
Let's hear again from neuroscientist Dr. Catherine Loveday.

65
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,120
What was the difference?

66
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,759
When people are observing you, they're doing a very non-judgmental,

67
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,479
fairly empathic way, and not actually noticing the things that you're self-conscious about.

68
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:31,039
So, if, for example, you feel self-conscious about a spot on your nose or something that you're wearing,

69
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:32,479
that won't be what they're noticing.

70
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,159
It's a much less judgmental form of observation.

71
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,479
Right. So, even if we're feeling self-conscious about something,

72
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,920
that means feeling extra aware of an aspect of ourselves,

73
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,120
maybe our appearance or our clothes, we needn't be.

74
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,759
Yes, you don't need to feel self-conscious.

75
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,680
People aren't being judgmental.

76
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,319
And being judgmental means being critical.

77
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,599
That's good news.

78
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,280
So, even though all I'm thinking about is how badly I need a haircut,

79
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,640
the other person is probably noticing something completely different.

80
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,759
Back to the question about the invisibility cloak.

81
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,439
Which story is it in?

82
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,200
I said the Hobbit, and it was in fact Harry Potter.

83
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,920
Yeah.

84
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,719
Not only does the garment make you impossible to see,

85
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,600
it also protects you against magic spells.

86
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,360
Wow. I need one of those.

87
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,759
In the Hobbit, it's the ring that makes you invisible.

88
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,800
And in the invisible man, the main character uses chemicals to achieve the same effect.

89
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,439
Now, before we become invisible ourselves,

90
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,439
how about we go through today's words?

91
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,160
Marvelous.

92
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,720
First, we had invisible, which means impossible to see.

93
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,360
You could say that stars are invisible during the day.

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,360
They're only visible at night.

95
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,079
We also had cloak.

96
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,519
Who would wear a cloak?

97
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,279
Maybe a king or a monk?

98
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,479
Or maybe you knew?

99
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,879
I'm sure I could look good in a cloak.

100
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,159
That's a long piece of material worn over the shoulders.

101
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,839
What about illusion?

102
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,519
Illusions appear to be true, but they're not.

103
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,199
It can describe an idea.

104
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,599
You could say a politician has the illusion that everything he says is true.

105
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:11,039
Then we had mismatch, which can refer to the difference between two things,

106
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,439
which perhaps should be similar.

107
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,959
There's a mismatch between what Michael says and what he does.

108
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,039
Who's Michael?

109
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,240
Just an example.

110
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,759
You could also say that Michael and Simone are an unlikely couple.

111
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,279
They seem very different.

112
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,039
They're a bit of a mismatch.

113
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,039
What is it with you and Michael?

114
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,639
One, he doesn't exist, and two, I think you're being judgmental.

115
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,519
Well, I'm criticizing him, so yeah, you're right.

116
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,719
I'm being judgmental.

117
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:38,000
Perhaps I should stop.

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,279
It's just that I'm in love with Simone myself,

119
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,919
and I get all nervous and self-conscious when I see her.

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,960
You mean you become embarrassed about what she might think of you?

121
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,400
You become self-conscious.

122
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:48,879
I do.

123
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,439
Even though she doesn't exist, neither.

124
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,280
Well, only in my examples.

125
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,960
Sometimes I wish I really did have an invisibility cloak.

126
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,240
Hey, hang on, Dad.

127
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,439
Where have you gone?

128
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,960
Ha, ha, very funny.

129
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,639
I'm still perfectly visible.

130
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,319
Time to go.

131
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,040
But do visit our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube pages, and of course,

132
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,759
our website.

133
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,800
Goodbye for now.

134
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,439
Bye.
