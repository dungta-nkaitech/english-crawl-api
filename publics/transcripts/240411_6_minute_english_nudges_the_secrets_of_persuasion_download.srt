6-minute English from the BBC

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,800
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Neil

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,320
And I'm Beth

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,800
Have you ever been sent a text reminding you about a doctor's appointment

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,559
or impulsively bought something on the internet because there was only one left?

6
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,640
If any of these have happened to you, then you've been nudged

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,039
A Nudge is a subtle way of altering human behaviour

8
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,960
It's a powerful way for governments, advertisers and social media companies to encourage

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,439
or nudge people into making choices that benefit themselves and society as a whole

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,040
Imagine the government want people to eat better

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,280
It might encourage supermarkets to put healthy snacks in easy to reach shelves

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,600
near the checkout and hide the chocolate bars out of sight on the top shelf

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,719
Shoppers are being nudged to eat better

14
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,200
Well, that's the idea anyway

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:08,000
But often nudging is used less to benefit society and more to make money for big business

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,120
And it happens more often than people realise

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,000
So in this programme, we'll be asking whether the idea behind nudging

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,879
to influence human behaviour for good is still true today

19
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,040
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well

20
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,680
But first I have a question for you, Beth

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,280
Another example of nudging happened in Woolwich, an area of London which in 2011

22
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,520
had a problem with anti-social behaviour and particularly with shop windows being smashed

23
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,920
The local authority decided to use nudging to fix the problem

24
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,719
by painting pictures on the shop windows

25
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,640
But what did they paint?

26
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,719
Was it A cute kittens, B, babies faces or C, barking dogs

27
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,200
I guess barking dogs would keep the window breakers away

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,560
Okay, Beth, I'll reveal the correct answer later in the programme

29
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,960
Nudging started in 2008 with the publication of a book by Nobel Prize-winning economist Professor Richard Taylor

30
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,960
Professor Taylor's ideas about how to gently persuade people into making good decisions

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,600
became known as Nudge Theory

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,240
Advertising executive Rory Sutherland introduced Nudge Theory to his agency Ogilvy

33
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,959
Here's Rory explaining more to BBC Radio 4 programme analysis

34
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,840
Let's say you make the profitable option button green and highly attractive

35
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,159
The less profitable option you make it kind of grey and kind of manky looking

36
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,879
Okay, that would be an example of something which is

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,919
You know, a nudge not necessarily used in the best interests of the consumer

38
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:53,119
Advertisers use colours to nudge customers towards the profitable option

39
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:56,079
The one which is the most likely to make money

40
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:59,519
These appear brightly coloured and attractive on the screen

41
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,079
Whereas less profitable options are made to look manky

42
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:06,879
A slang word meaning dirty and unattractive

43
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,199
Here nudging isn't being used for the public good

44
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:16,239
These dark nudges, also called sludge, make money for a company

45
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,000
But are not always in the best interests of the consumer

46
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,040
If something is in your best interests, it's the most advantageous and beneficial thing for you to do

47
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,520
Dark nudges have caused many to question the morality of nudging

48
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,840
Including Neil Levy, Professor of Ethics at Oxford University

49
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,360
Speaking here to BBC Radio 4 programme analysis

50
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,879
The big one, the one people have concentrated on

51
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,359
Is that it's paternalistic

52
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,879
That is that nudge might be in our interests

53
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,120
But we want to make our own decisions

54
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,280
That's for people worry that nudges

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,199
Infantilise us

56
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,599
It's undermining our autonomy

57
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,039
Critics of nudging call it paternalistic

58
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,479
Meaning it wants to make decisions for people

59
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,000
Rather than letting them take responsibility for themselves

60
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,759
They also claim nudging infantilises people

61
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,759
It treats them like children

62
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,800
And as a result, people lose autonomy

63
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,560
The ability to make your own decisions about what to do

64
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,959
Rather than being told by someone else

65
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,480
I guess nudging itself is neither good nor bad

66
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,639
It just depends how you use it

67
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,240
Well, let's look on the positive side by revealing the answer to your question, Neil

68
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,720
Right, I asked you how authorities in Woolwich in South East London

69
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,720
Nudged anti-social window breakers to behave nicely

70
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,920
I guess it was by painting pictures of scary barking dogs on the windows

71
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,280
Which was the wrong answer I'm afraid Beth

72
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,960
In fact, Woolwich Council hired graffiti artists to paint pictures of local babies faces onto the window shutters

73
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,360
Not even the most hard-hearted criminal smashed those windows

74
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,439
And anti-social behaviour fell by 18% in one year

75
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,879
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme about nudging

76
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,960
Ways of gently persuading or encouraging someone to take decisions

77
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,400
Something which is profitable makes a profit or is likely to make money

78
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,560
Manky is slang for dirty and unattractive

79
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,280
If something is in your best interests

80
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,120
It's the most advantageous beneficial thing for you to do

81
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,360
A paternalistic person prefers making decisions for other people

82
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,120
Rather than letting them take responsibility for their own lives

83
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,199
To infantilise someone means to treat them as if they were a child

84
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,400
And finally, autonomy is the ability to make your own decisions about what to do

85
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,639
Rather than being told by someone else

86
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,560
Once again, our six minutes are up

And useful vocabulary here at six minute English

89
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,920
Goodbye for now

90
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,480
Goodbye
