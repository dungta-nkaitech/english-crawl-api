5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,080
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,120
And I'm Sam.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,879
Now Sam, how would you define eSports?

8
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,920
eSports. Well, this is essentially competitive video gaming.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,600
Individuals and teams take part in competitions

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,280
where they play video games.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,719
Ah, so just like me and my kids at the weekend.

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,480
Well, no.

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,560
eSports is enormous.

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,480
Tens of thousands of people turn up to watch these events.

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,480
The players are professional and get paid huge salaries.

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,400
The best ones are millionaires.

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,120
Well, maybe I'm not quite in that league yet.

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,560
But the business of eSports is our topic for this programme.

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,840
Before we press play on the subject, though, a question.

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,120
Approximately how much was generated by eSports and video games in the last year?

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,320
Was it A, $130 million?

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,960
B, $13 billion?

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,640
Or C, $130 billion? What do you think then, Sam?

24
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,280
I'm going to say $130 billion.

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,600
It's a huge amount, but I think it's that successful at the moment.

26
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,240
Okay, we'll find out if you're right at the end of the programme.

27
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,119
Not so long ago, the idea of making a living playing computer games

28
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,959
would have seemed impossible.

29
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,719
However, times have changed as technology has improved.

30
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:39,519
eSports are even going to be included in the 2022 Asian Games.

31
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,799
So it might not be long before they make an appearance at the Olympics.

32
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,319
Gabriel Rao is a pro eSportsman.

33
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,519
He was interviewed for the BBC programme in business.

34
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,560
He thinks eSports are going to grow and grow.

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,879
But does he think that's a bad thing?

36
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,240
It's becoming more of a normal sports thing,

37
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,920
with this generation about to have children and moving forward,

38
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,240
I feel like it might even become a staple.

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,920
Might become as normal as sports right now.

40
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,560
I don't think it necessarily has to be a bad thing.

41
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,240
It is time for tuning, though.

42
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,800
So I feel like if you do want to introduce anybody,

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,480
especially children in the video games,

44
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,680
this is a plan as the way to go.

45
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,439
So is the growth of eSports a bad thing?

46
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,039
Not according to Gabriel.

47
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,599
He thinks that people having children now

48
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,840
have grown up with computer games.

49
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,920
And these are beginning to be seen in the same way as traditional sports.

50
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,080
In fact, he thinks they will become a staple.

51
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,400
And what does he mean by that?

52
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,480
Something that is a staple is a basic element,

53
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,640
something we expect.

54
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:53,519
For example, in the UK, we talk about potatoes being a staple food,

55
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,439
and football being a staple of the school curriculum.

56
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,719
Ah, but he does mention a disadvantage, doesn't he?

57
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:06,079
Yes, he speaks quite quickly, but he says that it is time consuming.

58
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:07,919
It eats up a lot of time.

59
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,479
Ah, yes, I know that from my own experience.

60
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:13,759
I can start playing a game and then find that many hours have passed,

61
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,959
and it's the middle of the night.

62
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,120
And that's why Gabriel goes on to talk about the need for discipline.

63
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,240
This is having strict controls and restrictions,

64
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,400
and importantly, sticking to them.

65
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,280
So for example, if you say you're only going to play for an hour every day,

66
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,439
you have to stop playing after an hour, even if you want to carry on.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,040
That's discipline.

68
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,319
And he makes the point that this is important if you're introducing children to video games.

69
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,599
Not everyone involved in eSports wants to be a player.

70
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,439
It's now possible to study the business of eSports at university,

71
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,079
where you can learn how to manage eSports events.

72
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,680
These are the thoughts of a student on one of those courses,

73
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,079
talking about her response to seeing a big eSports event.

74
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,959
When you look at the background of how it all comes together and the people that

75
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,719
spend all that time getting into it, for me, I would love to put something like that together,

76
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,479
not so much play it, but to put that together and create that experience for the people.

77
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,839
And that was just my main aspiration, really.

78
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,720
So she doesn't want to play, does she?

79
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,240
No, she doesn't.

80
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,519
She seems more interested in putting together an event,

81
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,879
which means setting up and managing an event for others to take part in.

82
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,680
That, she said, was her aspiration, her ambition.

83
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,639
Right, before we review the vocabulary, let's have the answer to our quiz question.

84
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,760
Approximately how much was generated by eSports and video games in the last year?

85
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:53,600
A, $130 million, B, $13 billion, or C, $130 billion.

86
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,640
What did you say, Sam?

87
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,520
I thought $130 billion.

88
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,080
And for once, you're right, so well done.

89
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,440
The actual figure was approximately $137 billion,

90
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,080
which was more than the music industry, when you include music sales and concerts.

91
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,600
Right, on now to remind ourselves of some words and phrases from today's programme.

92
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,960
Yes, we've been looking at eSports, the world of competitive video gaming.

93
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,040
We heard that it was becoming so normal that it might become a staple,

94
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,600
an expected basic activity in the same way sports like football are.

95
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,080
But be warned, playing video games is very time consuming.

96
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
It eats up a lot of time.

97
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,080
So you need to have discipline.

98
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,279
That means you need to have and keep to restrictions,

99
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,800
such as the length of time you play or the time of day you play.

100
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,959
That is particularly important for children.

101
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,919
If you organise an event, you can say that you put it together.

102
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,360
And your ambition, your hope for the future, is an aspiration.

103
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,319
And my aspiration is to beat my high score on my favourite game.

104
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,759
So are we done now, Neil?

105
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,599
Yes, it's game over for today.

106
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:04,719
We'll see you again soon.
