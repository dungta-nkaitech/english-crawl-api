00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,359
Welcome to 6 Minute English, where we bring you a thoughtful topic and six items of vocabulary.

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,199
I'm Rob and I'm Neil.

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,480
So I was watching an old Woody Allen movie last night.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,440
Okay, he's the anxious middle-aged guy from New York who talks about his problems all the time.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,240
That's the one. He was paying for psychoanalysis.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,480
And that's a type of talk therapy that was popular in the 1970s.

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,240
Do you know what therapy means, Rob?

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,640
Yes, therapy means a type of treatment for a problem or illness.

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,560
And talk therapy is a treatment for psychological problems,

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:52,079
which means problems of the mind, in case you were struggling with another long Greek word, Neil.

15
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,960
Train therapists work with you on ways to understand your thoughts, feelings and behaviour.

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,840
Hey, Rob, I'm an expert on long Greek words.

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,240
Psychology is the noun, by the way.

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,799
And the prefix psycho in front of any word means to do with the mind.

19
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,519
For example, the horror movie psycho,

20
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,000
which is all about the disturbed mind of the main character, Norman Bates.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Where disturbed means not thinking or behaving in a normal way,

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,799
because you have psychological problems,

23
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,079
Norman Bates would have found talk therapy helpful, don't you think?

24
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,159
Hmm, I'm not sure, really.

25
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:29,359
Anyway, let's have a quiz question, shall we now, Neil.

26
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,039
Can you tell me who invented the first talk therapy?

27
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:39,120
Was it a Boris Karloff, B Carl Jung, or C Sigmund Freud?

28
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,599
I'm going to go for Sigmund Freud.

29
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,280
Okay, interesting answer.

30
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,560
We'll find that later whether it was the right one or not.

31
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,439
Now, moving on, what do you think is the most common psychological problem to day, Neil?

32
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,799
It's depression.

33
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,599
And depression, a feeling of unhappiness that can affect

34
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,839
your thoughts, behavior and feelings,

35
00:01:57,839 --> 00:02:02,159
is the most common psychological problem affecting people throughout the world.

36
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,599
Hmm, how depressing.

37
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,959
And that's the adjective.

38
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,839
It makes me feel depressed just thinking about it.

39
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:12,240
And depressed is the adjective we use to describe how we are feeling.

40
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,919
Don't feel depressed, Rob.

41
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,759
Let's listen to Professor Brent Roberts from the University of Illinois

42
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,039
to find out more about the benefits of talk therapy.

43
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,719
Seeing a therapist does result in marked changes in psychological functioning.

44
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,919
So, people get less depressed and they get less anxious.

45
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,680
And it seems to be regardless of what type of intervention is engaged.

46
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,039
And that is and has been one of the more positive aspects of the therapy research that we've seen.

47
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,560
So, when people talk to therapists about their problems,

48
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,959
it results in marked changes in their psychological functioning.

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,200
Marked here means obvious or noticeable.

50
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,600
And these marked changes are that people become less depressed and anxious.

51
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,080
An intervention, by the way, is something you do to improve a medical problem.

52
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,920
And in this context, it refers to different types of talk therapy.

53
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,120
But why is talking about our problems helpful, Neil?

54
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,200
I think it gives a shape to our problems.

55
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,840
It makes them seem clearer and that's a first step in being able to manage them.

56
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,480
Also, a problem shared is a problem halved as the saying goes.

57
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:24,159
There's also some scientific evidence that talk therapy can change the way we think and feel

58
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,759
by replacing negative thought patterns with positive ones.

59
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,039
Medication can also change the way we think and feel.

60
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,439
Some people take pills to treat depression.

61
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,919
But medication can have negative effects.

62
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,199
For example, it can make you feel sleepy during the daytime.

63
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,120
Well, here's a positive thought.

64
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,359
Let's check how much we've learned today by going over today's vocabulary.

65
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:46,959
We had therapy.

66
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,480
Therapy is a type of treatment for a problem or illness.

67
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,840
There's therapy, therapist, therapeutic.

68
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,719
My therapist is using a new therapy with me.

69
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,640
It's very therapeutic.

70
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,600
Therapotic means treating an illness.

71
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,040
But in a more general sense, it can simply mean relaxing.

72
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,480
For example, I find listening to music very therapeutic.

73
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay, next up, psychological relating to the mind.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,560
Psychology, psychologist, psychological.

75
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,639
Depression and anxiety are both psychological problems.

76
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,839
My friend is studying psychology at university.

77
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,000
I want to be a famous psychologist.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,759
A career change at your age, Neil.

79
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,319
You've kept that one a secret.

80
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,399
Okay, number three, disturbed.

81
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,120
Not thinking or behaving in a normal way because you have psychological problems.

82
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,680
She was a disturbed young woman.

83
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,040
Or disturbing.

84
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,000
I've been having very disturbing dreams recently.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,199
No, Paul Neil.

86
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,240
Disturbing here means upsetting or worrying.

87
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,680
Next item, depression.

88
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,560
A feeling of unhappiness that can affect your thoughts,

89
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,399
behavior and feelings.

90
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,240
We felt depressed by the news.

91
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,240
The news was very depressing.

92
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,920
All right, let's lift the mood.

93
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,800
Marked means obvious or noticeable.

94
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,360
There's been a marked improvement in your English homework.

95
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,959
There was a marked increase in the company's profits last year.

96
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,800
And finally, intervention.

97
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,039
Something you do to improve a problem,

98
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,480
medical or otherwise.

99
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,160
Let me intervene at this point.

100
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,000
Intervene, that's the verb and in this context, it means to interrupt.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,640
And say, we've forgotten the quiz question, Rob.

102
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,560
Oh, no. Good intervention.

103
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,200
Yes, let's remind ourselves of that quiz question.

104
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,000
Who invented the first talking therapy?

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,800
And you said, Sigmund Freud, which is the right answer.

106
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,240
So well done, Neil.

107
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,680
Psychonalysis was invented in the early 1890s

108
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,319
by the Austrian-eurologist Sigmund Freud.

109
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,600
The patient lies on a couch and talks about their thoughts,

110
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,160
feelings and dreams while the therapist listens.

111
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,240
Psychoanalytic sessions typically last 50 minutes

112
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,160
and take place four to five times a week.

113
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,160
Okay, good to know.

114
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,760
But I think I prefer our own brand of talk therapy here on the show.

115
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,200
And listeners, you can express your thoughts and feelings

116
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,640
by visiting our Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages.

117
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,400
Hmm, talk to you again soon.

118
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,200
Bye-bye.

119
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,680
So, tell me about your childhood, Rob.

120
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,000
6-minute English from the BBC.
