4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,200
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,320
And I'm Rob.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,559
Now, Alice, what did you get up to at the weekend?

7
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,120
Oh, I did some spring cleaning,

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,280
which means cleaning a place very well,

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,000
especially places you don't clean often.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,240
So I was tidying up my wardrobe,

11
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,079
trying to organize things.

12
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:33,119
And suddenly, hundreds of shoes tumbled on my head.

13
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:34,320
Poor Alice.

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,719
But why do you have so many shoes?

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,679
And why do you keep them at the top of your wardrobe?

16
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,799
I only have three pairs.

17
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,119
I like to match my shoes to my outfit,

18
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:44,879
and three pairs wouldn't do the trick.

19
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:49,759
Well, the subject of today's show is having too much stuff,

20
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,000
and you're making me feel guilty, Rob.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,079
You must have too much of something.

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,759
Yes, plastic bags.

23
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:58,799
I think they're useful, but they're getting out of hand,

24
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,799
and that means not under control.

25
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,559
They're taking over my kitchen.

26
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,200
You can recycle plastic bags, you know, Rob.

27
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,519
Well, you can recycle shoes too, you know, Alice.

28
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:08,079
Oh, yes.

29
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,319
Now, in general, I don't have a lot of clutter in my flat,

30
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,560
and that means an untidy collection of objects.

31
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,680
Clutter makes it harder to find the things you need.

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,959
And it makes moving house and nightmare.

33
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,280
All those boxes full of things you don't need.

34
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,879
Good point.

35
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,159
I have a friend who suggested the three-bucket system.

36
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,599
You sought things into three different buckets.

37
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,159
One you label as to keep, one as to get rid of,

38
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,879
and one as maybe to get rid of.

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,960
Get rid of, by the way, means to remove something you don't want.

40
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,079
It's the maybe bucket that's tricky, isn't it?

41
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,640
You never know if you might need something in the future.

42
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,640
Yes, it would need to be a big bucket, too.

43
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,520
Yes, it would.

44
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,319
Well, I think we could all live better with less.

45
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,119
Okay, well, let's have today's quiz question

46
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,679
before we talk about decluttering our lives.

47
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:04,479
So, which word, Alice, means a belief that physical possessions

48
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,799
are the most important thing in life?

49
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,879
Is it A, metaphysics, B, materialism, or C, existentialism?

50
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,319
Hmm, okay.

51
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,039
I think it's B, materialism.

52
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,719
Okay, well, we'll find out if you got the answer right or wrong

53
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:23,919
later on in the show.

54
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:29,120
Now, let's listen to B Johnson, author of Zero Waste Home,

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,280
talking about how she and her family have adopted a minimalist

56
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,799
or deliberately simple lifestyle in their California home.

57
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,359
We've really asked ourselves what is in that we really need.

58
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:47,199
We've asked really true questions and evaluated every single thing that we have.

59
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,599
There is nothing that we overlook.

60
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,599
I even came to one day look at my vegetable peeler, for example,

61
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,639
and asked myself, do I really need that vegetable peeler?

62
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,560
So, one day, B Johnson decided to evaluate

63
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,879
or to judge the importance of something,

64
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,560
to see if she needed it.

65
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,639
Hmm, she evaluated her vegetable peeler and decided to put it in the get rid of bucket.

66
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,559
Yes, and to overlook something means not to see it.

67
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:22,239
Now, I don't blame B at all because I don't like peeling vegetables either.

68
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,119
And you can actually get the benefit of the vitamins and minerals by eating the skins.

69
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:29,199
Hmm, very healthy, Rob.

70
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,279
We can really live with fewer things,

71
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:35,439
but some people can't help looking for the latest version of something

72
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,959
or go for designer goods.

73
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,359
Writer and journalist James Wormen warns us about this.

74
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,240
He wonders how much stuff is too much.

75
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,880
This thing about need is such a dangerous term because what do you need?

76
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,280
And I'm not anti-stuff. Stuff is good.

77
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,480
I'm anti-too much stuff and I'm anti the wrong stuff.

78
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,960
Don't go out and buy that labeled good that you think is going to make people

79
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,080
think something more of you. That's not going to make you happy.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,520
James Wormen there.

81
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,160
Now, Alice, do you buy labeled goods?

82
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,919
I'm afraid I do.

83
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,920
And labeled goods or products are the ones with a famous brand name like Gucci,

84
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,000
Dior, Prada, etc.

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,639
But I do think James Wormen is right.

86
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,639
Buying things just because other people have them, for example, doesn't make us happy.

87
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,839
Yeah, that's true.

88
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,279
But as he says, not everything is the wrong stuff.

89
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:36,319
For example, I'm very fond of my large schoolboy collection of superhero comics.

90
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,040
I might not need them, but they make me happy.

91
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,680
So what stuff makes you happy, Alice?

92
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Oh, well, I like my music CDs and my books, even though I've got the music on an MP3 player,

93
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,319
and I don't often pull a book out from the bookcase.

94
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,160
They have sentimental value, don't they?

95
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,680
And that means the importance of something because of a personal or emotional feeling that we attach to it.

96
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,920
Well, I sold all my music CDs online ages ago.

97
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,080
Oh, well, that sounds like the sensible thing to do.

98
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,560
Okay, I think it's time for the answer to today's quiz question, Rob.

99
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,280
Yes, I asked you which word means a belief that physical possessions are the most important thing in life.

100
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,120
Is it a metaphysics, be materialism, or see existentialism?

101
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,040
Mm, and I said be materialism.

102
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,120
And you were right, Alice, well done.

103
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,920
The answer is indeed be materialism.

104
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:37,360
This is the word used to refer to a desire for material things and wealth and little or no interest in ethical values.

105
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,879
Now, can we hear the words we learned today, please, Alice?

106
00:05:40,879 --> 00:06:04,080
Yes, of course. They are spring cleaning, out of hand, clutter, get rid of, materialism, minimalist, evaluate, overlook, labelled, sentimental value.

107
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:07,359
Well, that's the end of today's six-minute English.

108
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,680
Don't forget to join us again soon. Bye for now.

109
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,399
Bye.
