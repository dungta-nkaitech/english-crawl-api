00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,080
Hello, this is 6 Minute English, I'm Sam.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,440
And I'm Georgina.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,920
Georgina, what language is do you speak?

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,800
Hmm, well, my mother tongue is English,

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,679
and I also speak Spanish and French badly.

8
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:26,960
Hmm, okay.

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,560
It's interesting that we say

10
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,959
mother tongue, isn't it?

11
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:35,119
Like many languages, English has a number of gender-specific terms

12
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,200
that don't refer to gender-specific ideas and concepts.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,399
And this complicated relationship between language and gender

14
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,799
is what we'll be talking about today.

15
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,200
But first, this week's quiz question,

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,480
which is also on the topic of languages.

17
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,039
Which of these languages is the newest?

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,920
Is it A, Esperanto, B, Africans,

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,960
or C, light-walt-free?

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,400
What do you think Georgina?

21
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,840
Hmm, well, I've only heard of two of these,

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,159
Esperanto and Afrikaans.

23
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,960
So I think I'm going to choose the other one, light-walt-free.

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,040
Purely, as I've never heard of it.

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,359
So I think that must be the one.

26
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,240
Okay, well, we'll find out if your intuition is correct

27
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,920
later in the programme.

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,359
Professor Lara Boroditsky is a cognitive scientist

29
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,439
who was a guest on the BBC World Service programme, The Conversation.

30
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,799
She was asked about why we use the term mother tongue in English.

31
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,719
Different languages actually do it differently,

32
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,400
but definitely there's a strong association between

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,159
mothers as primary caregivers and people who teach us things.

34
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,000
And so there's that point of origin metaphor that applies in a lot of languages.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,359
So how does she explain the use of mother tongue, Georgina?

36
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,640
Well, she says it's a form of metaphor,

37
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,519
a metaphor is a way of describing something by comparing it to something else.

38
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:06,400
In a metaphor though, you don't say that something is like something else.

39
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,960
You say that it is something else.

40
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,719
For example, having good friends is the key to a happy life.

41
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,159
Hmm, it is indeed.

42
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,560
In this metaphor, language is seen as coming from your primary caregiver,

43
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,360
the person who looked after you most when you were young.

44
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,600
And traditionally, this was mothers.

45
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:30,240
So this is perhaps the point of origin, the starting place of the metaphorical phrase mother tongue.

46
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,760
Let's listen again.

47
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,680
Different languages actually do it differently,

48
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,400
but definitely there's a strong association between

49
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,120
mothers as primary caregivers and people who teach us things.

50
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,000
And so there's that point of origin metaphor that applies in a lot of languages.

51
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,680
Language is very powerful in society and culture.

52
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,280
And when it comes to gendered language, it can cause some issues.

53
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,680
Here's Lara Borditsky again.

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,640
In English, of course, we have some words that are gendered like actor and actress or waiter

55
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,280
and waitress.

56
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,240
And very commonly when there are those two gender forms,

57
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:14,400
people perceive the masculine form as being a more prestigious job or a more skilled job

58
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,480
than the feminine form.

59
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,599
So an actor is a fancier job than an actress,

60
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,840
a waiter is a fancier job than a waiter is.

61
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,079
And so they could then come with pay disparities and so on.

62
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:32,799
So what's the subconscious difference in attitude towards, for example, an actor and actress?

63
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,120
Well, she says that people perceive those roles differently.

64
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:43,199
This means that we are aware of or believe there is a difference in the jobs because of the

65
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:49,919
vocabulary. The male form is perceived to be more prestigious, more important, more respected,

66
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:52,079
even though it's exactly the same job.

67
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,319
And this attitude can lead to problems such as disparities in pay.

68
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,319
A disparity is a difference and inequality.

69
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,280
And in the world of work, it can mean men getting paid more than women for the same job.

70
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,759
Here's Professor Borditsky again.

71
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:14,399
In English, of course, we have some words that are gendered like actor and actress or waiter

72
00:04:14,399 --> 00:04:21,360
and waitress. And very commonly when there are those two gender forms, people perceive the

73
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:28,240
masculine form as being a more prestigious job or a more skilled job than the feminine form.

74
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,599
So an actor is a fancier job than an actress, a waiter is a fancier job than a waitress.

75
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,840
And so they could then come with paid disparities and so on.

76
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay, before we take another look at today's vocabulary, let's reveal the answer to this week's quiz.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,760
Which of these languages is the newest? Is it A, Esperanto, B, Afrikaans or C, like Walpree?

78
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,360
Georgina, what did you say?

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,480
I thought it had to be like Walpree, but just because I'd never heard of it before.

80
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,400
Mm-hmm, well, congratulations. Your instincts were good. That is correct.

81
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,399
So let's move on to the vocabulary and look at today's words and phrases again.

82
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,039
A primary caregiver is a person who has most responsibility for looking after someone.

83
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,399
A point of origin is the place or time when something begins.

84
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:23,599
A metaphor is a way of describing something. We can say that something is something else that has

85
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:27,279
similar qualities. Your a star. Oh, thank you.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,199
No, no, I meant your a star is an example of a metaphor.

87
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,839
Okay, of course I knew that.

88
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,839
Mm-hmm, yeah, okay, you say so.

89
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,399
To perceive is to think of something in a particular way.

90
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:45,519
We might perceive the value of different jobs based on the vocabulary used to describe them.

91
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:49,599
Something prestigious is important and respected.

92
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:55,439
And finally, a disparity is a difference and inequality and is often used when talking about

93
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:01,360
how men and women aren't always paid the same for the same job. And that's all from us.

94
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,680
We look forward to your company again soon. In the meantime, you can always find us online

95
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,079
on social media and on the BBC Learning English app. Bye for now. Bye!
