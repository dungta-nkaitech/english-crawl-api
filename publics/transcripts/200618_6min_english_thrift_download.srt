Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,480
And I'm Sam. Are you a saver or a spender, Sam?

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,519
Well, I'm trying to limit my spending right now because I'm saving up for a deposit to buy a house.

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,960
Saving money is not always easy as we'll find out in today's programme, which is all about

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,920
thrift. Thrift is not a simple idea to define. It's to do with living a simple life free from

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,719
the need to constantly buy the latest products. Today's consumer culture encourages us to spend,

10
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,879
spend, spend, spend, but it hasn't always been that way. The Victorians, for example, told people

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:01:00,480
to save up for a rainy day, meaning to keep some money back in case of unforeseen emergencies.

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,359
But before we discover more about that, it's time for today's quiz question.

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,840
If you're trying to save money, you probably know how hard it can be.

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,920
So my question is, what percentage of people in the UK do you think have less than a thousand

15
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:22,320
pounds in savings? Is it A, 5%, B, 15% or C, 30%.

16
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,799
Well, if I'm anything to go by, I'd say C, 30%.

17
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,719
Okay, well, we'll find the correct answer out later.

18
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,760
I mentioned before that thrift is a difficult idea to define. So here's Alison Hume, a lecturer at

19
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,760
the University of Northampton, explaining more to BBC Radio 4's programme Thinking Allowed.

20
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:50,080
Well, there are two dictionary definitions of thrift. The older of the two comes from the word

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,280
thrive, etymologically, and describes thrift as the ability to live well and to flourish. So it's

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,840
that sense of human flourishing. The more recent definition is the one we're probably more familiar

23
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,760
with, which is about frugality. All of that said, it's been used historically, of course, by various

24
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,280
people in various moments, in various different places, in very different ways. And they've often had

25
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,640
a social or religious agenda. It seems the oldest definition of thrift has nothing to do with

26
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:26,400
saving money and is connected to the verbs thrive and flourish, meaning to grow or develop successfully.

27
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,920
It was only later with the Puritans, 16th century English Christians with a reputation for strict

28
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,719
discipline, that the meaning of thrift changed and became associated with frugality,

29
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:47,360
being careful not to spend too much money or eat too much food. The Puritans believe that being

30
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,360
frugal was a religious virtue and that people ought to save money in order to give to others in need.

31
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,599
Later on, the meaning of thrift changed again. During the Victorian era, it was connected to the

32
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:06,319
idea of managing your own money in order to be a responsible citizen. Throughout history, then,

33
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,280
there have been different versions of thrift. And this may be because different religions or

34
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,400
social groups had their own agenda, a specific aim or reason for a particular group to do something.

35
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,560
For example, the Victorian definition of thrift was based on a social agenda about being a respectable

36
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,199
member of society. Ideas about frugality and thrift changed again during the Second World War,

37
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:37,439
when the public was encouraged to avoid waste so that every material resource could go into the war

38
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,359
effort. And in the post-war period, it changed again as people's wealth and standard of living

39
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:49,199
increased. Here's Alison Hume again. It's the idea that once people had enough to meet their

40
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:55,359
kind of basic needs, there was this kind of moral slide into consumerism. It's not a view that I

41
00:03:55,359 --> 00:04:00,079
subscribe to in a simplistic sense myself. I think there's a very fine line to tready. There's no

42
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,760
point denying that certainly in the developed world there's been a rise in consumer capitalism,

43
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:10,480
that's just a truism. But thrift hasn't declined. In modern times, people's motivation to save

44
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,879
up and be thrifty declined once they had enough to meet their basic needs. The basic necessities

45
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:23,759
needed to survive, like food, clothes and shelter and nothing extra. Alison mentions that once these

46
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:31,279
basic needs were satisfied, people moved away from thrift into consumerism. The desire to buy

47
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:38,399
luxury products, which were not absolutely necessary. According to some, this created a moral

48
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:46,959
slide, a decrease in the standards of behaving in good, fair and honest ways. The rise in consumer

49
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:52,639
capitalism we have seen around the world is an example of a truism, something that is so obviously

50
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,000
true. It's not worth repeating. What is worth repeating is the quiz question, though, Neil.

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,159
Yes, I asked you how many British people had savings of under a thousand pounds? And I said,

52
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:12,079
see, 30%. In fact, Sam, it's B, 15%. No, so I guess I'm not such a bad saver after all.

53
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,439
Okay, well, today we've been talking about the changing meanings of thrift,

54
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:22,639
an idea connected to frugality. Being careful not to spend too much money.

55
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,240
The original meaning of thrift was too flourish, grow or develop successfully,

56
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,920
but that definition changed as different religious groups, like the Puritans, promoted their own

57
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:40,959
agenda. Aim or reason for a particular group to do something. In recent times, people's ability to

58
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:46,959
meet their basic needs, the necessities for survival, like food and shelter, have reduced the

59
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:53,519
importance of thrift, which some believe has created a moral slide, a reduction in standards of

60
00:05:53,519 --> 00:06:00,000
moral behaviour. And the associated rise of consumer capitalism is an example of a truism,

61
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,399
something that is obviously true and generally accepted by all. That's all for now. Join us again

62
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,719
next time for more topical discussion and vocabulary by for now. Bye-bye.
