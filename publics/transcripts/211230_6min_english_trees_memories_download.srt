00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,760
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,879
And I'm Sam.

4
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:23,440
Over the past 18 months, we've heard a lot about the human immune system.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,839
The cells in our bodies that fight diseases like coronavirus.

6
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:32,399
We know that in humans, the bloodstream carries immune cells around our body.

7
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,320
But what about trees and plants? They don't have blood. So how do they protect themselves?

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,200
That's a good question, Sam. And the answer involves memory. Us humans

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,320
store memories in our brain, but our body also remembers things, including stressful

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,840
situations from the past, which it stores in our genes. The information gets passed on to our

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,359
children genetically.

12
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:01,039
But surely trees don't have memories, Neil. I mean, do you think a tree can remember being young

13
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,960
or what it was doing last year?

14
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,599
Well, not exactly, but trees grow rings, a layer of wood for each year of growth. That could be a

15
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:15,120
kind of memory. In this programme, we'll be asking whether trees can remember. And if so,

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,640
does it make them stronger and better able to fight disease?

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:25,280
But before that, I have a question for you, Sam. As I said, trees grow a new ring every year.

18
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:31,680
And by counting them, we can estimate their age. One of Earth's longest living trees is the great

19
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,599
bristle cone pine found on the west coast of America. But how long can these trees live?

20
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:45,519
Is it A? Over a thousand years? B? Over three thousand years? Or C? Over five thousand years?

21
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:52,239
Wow, it would be a job to count the rings on those trees. I'll say B. Over three thousand years.

22
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,039
Okay, Sam, we'll reveal the correct answer later.

23
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,719
And like us, trees don't have blood in bones to protect them from outside attacks.

24
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,079
So how exactly does a tree's immune system work?

25
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,159
That's what BBC World Service programme crowd science asked bioscientist Jury and Tom.

26
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,039
Here's what he said.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,280
Plans in particular need to have a very efficient immune system for two important reasons.

28
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,039
Firstly, they sit at the bottom of the food chain. So there are a lot of opportunistic organisms out there,

29
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:28,960
including insect herbivores and microbial pathogens. We want to tap into that biochemical energy

30
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,439
that is stored in plants. The other reason is plants are rooted to the ground.

31
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,199
They cannot escape from the stressful conditions in their environment.

32
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,840
It's hard for trees to protect themselves. Unlike animals, they can't run away.

33
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,800
And they're at the bottom of the food chain. The plants and animals linked in a chain of

34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,640
eating weaker things and then being eaten by stronger ones.

35
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,480
Rabbits eat grass and in turn are eaten by foxes.

36
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,879
Right. If you're at the bottom of the food chain, everything wants to eat you,

37
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:07,199
including opportunistic animals. If something is opportunistic, it takes advantage of a situation

38
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:13,360
to gain some benefit for itself. True leaves are opportunities for hungry insects and caterpillars

39
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,280
to eat. So trees need immunity because they're under attack, either from disease or from living

40
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,800
things wanting to eat them. But what about memory, Sam? If trees can remember stress,

41
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,600
types of insects that eat it, for example, they might be better prepared in future.

42
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,960
For me, stress is a work deadline or moving house, but for trees it's more basic,

43
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:41,040
something like not getting enough water. Dr Estrella Loonerdiets believes trees record stress in their

44
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:48,159
rings. A small ring showing that the tree didn't grow much that year indicates some outside stress.

45
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,840
She explained more to BBC World Service Programme, Crowd Science.

46
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:59,919
Our hypothesis could be that depending on the level of that stress, so if it was a really long

47
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:07,519
lasting drought of a few years, then maybe the tree can remember it for a long time because it needs

48
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,920
to adapt to that hostile environment. Now, maybe the hypothesis could be the other way around.

49
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,160
Like if it's maybe it was a very dry July, for instance. Maybe the tree is not even that

50
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,639
bothered. And then it forgets within one year because that memory of stress is going to be holding

51
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:34,639
it back on its growth, for instance. Dr Loonerdiets has a hypothesis, an idea that explains how

52
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,399
or why something happens, which has yet to be tested to see if it's correct. Her hypothesis is

53
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:46,639
that trees remember stressful outside events, something like a drought, a long period of time with

54
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,319
little or no rain. For a tree which has lived for hundreds of years, it might be useful to remember

55
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:59,120
that 1947 was a very dry summer. On the other hand, maybe that stressful year is best for Gossin.

56
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,639
Maybe the tree is not bothered, not worried or concerned because it's not important to it.

57
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,160
So trees do have memories, but they don't let it get them stressed. Maybe that's the secret to a

58
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,759
long life. But what's the answer to your question, Neil? Ah yes, I asked you how long Earth's

59
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:23,120
oldest trees, great bristle cone pines, can live. I said B, over 3000 years. What was I right?

60
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,480
You were wrong, I'm afraid Sam. They live even longer, over 5000 years, in fact,

61
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:34,240
all the way back to the Bronze Age. What memories those trees must have, if only they could speak.

62
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,720
Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned starting with immune system, the body's way of

63
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,720
fighting infection and disease. A food chain describes how plants and animals get eaten and eat

64
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,560
each other. Opportunistic people take advantage of a situation to get some benefit for themselves.

65
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,639
A hypothesis is an idea to explain how or why something happens that hasn't been tested to see

66
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,800
if it's correct. A drought is a long period of time with little or no rain. And finally, if you're not

67
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,160
bothered about something, you're not worried because it's not important to you. Our six minutes are

68
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,760
over. Bye for now. Bye.
