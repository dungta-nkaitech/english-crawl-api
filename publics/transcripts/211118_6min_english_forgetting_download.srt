4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,960
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Georgina.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,080
And I'm Rob.

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,000
Do you have a good memory, Rob?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,679
Can you remember people's names or where you left your car keys?

8
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,679
Well, I can remember people's faces,

9
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,160
but I have a terrible memory for names.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,039
And sometimes I'll be eagerly reading a book,

11
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,600
but then a week later, I can't remember a single thing about it.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,039
Well, you're not alone.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,480
Many people find it hard to remember things they've read or learned,

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,679
while other sometimes useless information sticks with them.

15
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,120
In this programme, we'll be finding out why we forget the things we've learned.

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,320
Whether that's someone's name, a word in English,

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,079
or where you put your wallet.

18
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,199
But first, let me ask you my quiz question, Rob.

19
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,000
Before I forget, you and I might struggle to remember someone's phone number,

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,480
but Chinese student, Chaolue, has a record-breaking memory.

21
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,319
In 2005, she recited the numbers of pi,

22
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,400
the mathematical equation describing the proportions of a circle,

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,519
but how many digits did she manage to remember?

24
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,640
Was it A, 48,000?

25
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,200
B, 68,000.

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,000
Or C, 88,000.

27
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,879
Wow, it sounds like Chaolue has an incredible memory.

28
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,799
I'll say she remembered B, 68,000 digits of pi.

29
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,840
Okay, Rob, let's remember to find out the answer at the end of the programme.

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,760
Okay, we'll do.

31
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,599
Now, someone like Chaolue might have a photographic memory,

32
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,799
the ability to remember things in exact detail,

33
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,560
like looking at a photograph.

34
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,599
But for the rest of us, things are more complicated.

35
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:01,840
Dr. Jarrett Horvath is an educational neuroscientist at the University of Melbourne.

36
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,479
According to him, there are two rules which explain how we remember information.

37
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,000
Listen to Dr. Horvath talking to BBC World Service programme, The Y Factor,

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,120
and see if you can hear the two rules he mentions.

39
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,039
Rule number one is repetition is key.

40
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,840
The odds of remembering something after a one-off are incredibly slim.

41
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,879
Unless you can immediately link it to something you already understand.

42
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,399
So my middle name is Coony.

43
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:31,199
If I ever meet someone named Coony, I'll never forget that.

44
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,639
Because I have an immediate link.

45
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,639
But if I meet someone named Joe, eh.

46
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:37,919
So a one-off is, we all pretty much suck at it.

47
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:39,680
Unless we focus.

48
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,959
So rule two then becomes, we remember what we focus on.

49
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:47,039
The first rule for remembering is repetition.

50
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,359
The odds, meaning the probability of remembering something are low if you learn it as a one-off.

51
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,599
Something that only happens once.

52
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,599
Dr. Horvath's second rule is about focus.

53
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,639
We remember what we focus on.

54
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,759
This involves making links between new information and something you already understand.

55
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:11,759
These are the most effective methods of remembering.

56
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,959
And most of us suck at, or are bad at,

57
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,719
other ways of remembering things.

58
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,680
Now of course, one group of people who need good memory is students.

59
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,439
Do you remember cramming for school exams, Georgina?

60
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,159
Oh yes, staying up late, trying to revise everything the night before an exam.

61
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,319
I remember doing that, but it didn't work.

62
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,560
Yes, Dr. Horvath's research found that students who cram for tests forget around 90%

63
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,200
of what they studied within 72 hours.

64
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:49,679
He thinks education shouldn't be about trying to cram students' heads with facts and figures.

65
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:52,159
It should involve something more meaningful.

66
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,000
As he explains to BBC World Services, the wife actor.

67
00:03:57,119 --> 00:04:01,280
And the thing that I like about education is it's really moving from a model of,

68
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,280
just memorise as much as you can, into what we now call deep learning.

69
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,439
Which is, instead of giving you 100 things, and I just need to know that you can remember them,

70
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,879
I'm going to give you 10 things.

71
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,079
And instead of just being able to remember them, I want you to be able to

72
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:17,360
describe it deeply and come up with new ways of looking at it.

73
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,439
Traditionally, education involves memorising.

74
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,920
Learning information exactly as it is, so you can repeat it later.

75
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,879
But being able to repeat something like a parrot doesn't always mean you understand it.

76
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,120
Dr. Horvath advocates a technique called deep learning.

77
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,719
A complete way of learning something that means you fully understand and will not forget.

78
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:47,600
So remember, repetition, focus and deep learning are the memory muscles we need.

79
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,639
Maybe that's how Chinese student Chow Lu developed her record-breaking memory.

80
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,279
You do remember your quiz question, don't you, Georgina?

81
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:58,879
Yes, thank you, Rob. My memory isn't that bad.

82
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,159
I asked you how many digits of the mathematical equation Pi she could remember.

83
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:07,839
And I said B, 68,000 digits.

84
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:11,039
Which was the correct answer.

85
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,839
Actually, the number was so long it took her over 24 hours without a break to recite it all.

86
00:05:18,799 --> 00:05:21,919
Oh wow, her brain must have been aching after all that.

87
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,159
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from this programme, starting with a photographic memory,

88
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:33,359
which is the ability to remember things in exact detail, like looking at a photograph.

89
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:37,279
The odds of something happening mean the chances that it will happen.

90
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,560
A one-off is something that only happens once.

91
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:45,599
To suck out something is an informal way to say be bad at doing something.

92
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,079
It's more common in American English.

93
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,719
If you memorize something, you learn it exactly so that you can repeat it later.

94
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:59,439
And finally, deep learning describes a complete way of learning something so that you fully understand it

95
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,559
and will not forget it.

96
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:06,159
