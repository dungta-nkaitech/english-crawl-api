5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,240
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,600
And I'm Neil. Have you ever written any poetry, Alice?

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,559
No, have you?

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,440
Oh yes, I've got a sheath of poems from my youth.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,839
A sheath of something means a bundle of things, particularly paper.

10
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:27,679
What about now? Are you still writing?

11
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,000
No, my creative juices have dried up.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,439
Oh, what a shame. I would have loved to hear some of your poems.

13
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,079
Creative juices means a flow of ideas,

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,320
and the subject of today's show is creativity and writers' block,

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,320
which means not being able to write because of a psychological problem.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,519
So not like tennis elbow or golfers' knee then?

17
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:52,560
No, Neil, because a psychological problem refers to the mind, not the body.

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,079
And whilst some people view writers' block as nonsense,

19
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,799
others believe it is a serious psychological condition

20
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,039
that can get better with treatment.

21
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,119
Well, I have a question for you, Alice.

22
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,159
How does author of the Da Vinci code Dan Brown

23
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,000
deal with writers' block?

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,799
Does he hang upside down from the ceiling in gravity boots?

25
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,640
Be, clean his six bedroom house from top to bottom with a toothbrush,

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,519
or see run a half marathon listening to opera music by Richard Wagner.

27
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,599
Oh, I think it's see run a half marathon listening to Wagner.

28
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,959
Exercise and music might get your creative juices flowing again.

29
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,479
Well, we'll find out whether you got the right answer later on in the show.

30
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,439
But first, Alice, can you tell us where the term

31
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,039
writers' block comes from?

32
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:44,239
Well, the term was coined or invented in 1950 by a Viennese psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler.

33
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,319
Let's listen to Zachary Leeder,

34
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,199
professor of English literature at Rohampton University,

35
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:52,319
talking about the psychoanalytic theory of writers' block.

36
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:57,439
Before writers were blocked, the other metaphors that were used were things like

37
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,239
drying up or drying up or being frozen or stuck in a rut and so forth.

38
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,559
And the difference between being blocked and drying up is that in the case of

39
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:10,639
blockage, the problem is externalized and objectified.

40
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,039
It's not yourself that's the problem.

41
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,319
It's something that's outside you like an obstacle or a pediment,

42
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,680
something that you could really cut away and does a consequence

43
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,200
a cure like a growth or a foreign body.

44
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,200
So, writers' block is a metaphor for an obstacle,

45
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,480
something external rather than internal inside of you that's preventing you from working.

46
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,280
Doesn't that sound like an excuse for not doing anything, Alice?

47
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,080
It's not my fault, this impediment thing's getting in the way.

48
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,560
Yes. Well, impediment is another word for obstacle.

49
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,879
But how do you cut away a foreign body that isn't actually there?

50
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,519
I suppose psychoanalysts have an answer for that.

51
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,960
But seriously, I think writers probably do have a hard time.

52
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,000
You can sit down at your desk every morning at nine o'clock to write,

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,639
but that doesn't mean you're going to think of things to say.

54
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:01,199
Though we're never stuck for words, are we?

55
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,439
Not usually Neil, no.

56
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:10,240
But did you know that the ancient Greeks had muses or goddesses of creativity to help them?

57
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,560
So, Beyonce isn't a real muse.

58
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,359
I've heard people say, you know, Beyonce is my muse.

59
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,320
She's such a great singer, songwriter, dancer, role model.

60
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:24,560
Well, these days, muse can refer to anyone who inspires an artist, writer or musician.

61
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,080
But in ancient Greece, there were nine muses,

62
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,000
and depending on what type of creative thing you did, philosophy, poetry and science, and so on,

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,480
you invoked or called upon that particular muse to inspire you.

64
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,520
I call upon you, O'Alles, to enlighten us with more information about the Greek muses.

65
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,800
All right, then.

66
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,920
So, let's listen to Angie Hobbs instead.

67
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,880
She's professor of the public understanding of philosophy,

68
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,439
University of Sheffield here in the UK.

69
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,439
And here she is now talking about what the Greek muses symbolised.

70
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,760
We've seen that the muses were connected to running water, to springs, to fountains,

71
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,360
fluidity.

72
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,040
So, if you're musing, you are letting your mind wander,

73
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:15,840
you're opening yourself up to new influences and new ideas, and not thinking into structured away.

74
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:21,360
Musing, letting your mind wander, thinking in a fluid, unstructured way,

75
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,959
that all sounds very pleasant.

76
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,199
Maybe I should have another go at writing.

77
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,079
Well, according to research, some people are better at mind-wondering and opening themselves up

78
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,079
to new ideas than others. Their minds work differently.

79
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,839
They have more dopamine in the thalamus region of the brain.

80
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:41,439
The thalamus controls consciousness, sleep, and the senses,

81
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,479
and dopamine is the feel-good chemical in the brain.

82
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,119
Is that right?

83
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:51,199
Yes. And having more dopamine in the thalamus enables some people to see the world in a different way,

84
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,279
and they express this creatively through science, music, the arts.

85
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,879
Now, before you start musing on how much dopamine you have in your brain, Neil,

86
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,919
perhaps you can tell us the answer to today's quiz question.

87
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:09,040
I asked, how does author of the Da Vinci code Dan Brown deal with writer's block?

88
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,600
Does he, A, hang upside down from the ceiling and gravity boots,

89
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,920
B, clean his six bedroom house from top to bottom with a toothbrush,

90
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,319
or C, run a half marathon listening to opera music by Richard Wagner.

91
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,560
And I said C, run a half marathon listening to opera music by Richard Wagner.

92
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,840
And you were wrong, Alice.

93
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,400
Oh.

94
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,400
The answer is A, hang upside down from the ceiling and gravity boots.

95
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:32,800
Really?

96
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,439
Yes.

97
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,920
I expect all that increased blood flow to the brain is helpful in clearing writer's block.

98
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,520
Yes. Good plan.

99
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,240
Okay.

100
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,840
Here are the words we learned today.

101
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,520
Creative juices.

102
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,960
Writers block.

103
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,080
Coined.

104
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,520
Impediment.

105
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,800
Muses.

106
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,080
Envoked.

107
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,920
Thalamus.

108
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,960
Dopamine.

109
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,000
So Alice, shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,280
Thou art more lovely than...

111
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,120
That's not your poem, Neil.

112
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,319
It's Shakespeare's.

113
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,759
Well, that's the end of today's six minute English.

114
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,719
Okay, I'm off to lie on the sofa and invoke my muse.

115
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:08,240
Please join us again soon.

116
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,719
Goodbye.

117
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:09,279
Bye-bye.
