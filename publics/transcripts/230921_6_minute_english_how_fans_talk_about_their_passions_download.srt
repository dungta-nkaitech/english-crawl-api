2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,880
Hello, this is 6-Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Beth.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,080
And I'm Neil.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,800
If you really love something, maybe a sport or a hobby, a music band or a TV show,

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,120
you might call yourself a fan.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:29,280
Nowadays, thanks to the internet, fans from around the world can meet online to share their passion.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,560
And this has led to a new word, fandom.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,359
fandom is more than simply being a fan.

9
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:41,439
It's a whole culture created by a community of people to share their love of the same thing.

10
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:46,000
What's more, fandom has started to develop its own language.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,200
In this programme, we'll be taking a trip into the world of fandoms and, as usual,

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,560
we'll be learning some new and useful vocabulary too.

13
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,600
But before that, I have a question for you, Neil.

14
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:03,920
The original word fan was first used about Americans in the early 20th century.

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,680
But what were these Americans fans of?

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,719
Was it A. Hollywood movie stars, B. Baseball or C. Disney cartoons?

17
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,840
I'll guess they were fans of Disney cartoons.

18
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,560
Okay, Neil. We'll find out later in the programme.

19
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,120
Michael Bond is the author of a new book, Fans.

20
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:31,120
Here he discusses the meaning of fandom with BBC Radio 4 programme, Word of Mouse.

21
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,560
Often marked, and if you're a Jane Austen fan and you want to dress up in a bonnet and gown of the

22
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,400
Reconcy era, it's difficult to do that by yourself in public.

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,520
But once you join a fandom, there's no problem.

24
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,520
Fans are groups of like-minded people.

25
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,040
They share similar opinions, ideas or interests.

26
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,159
They do all kinds of weird and wonderful things together,

27
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,960
such as dressing up as Harry Potter characters,

28
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:30,480
behaviour, which might be called quirky, an adjective meaning odd or unusual, but in an interesting way.

29
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,319
Unfortunately, this quirky behaviour also means fans sometimes get mocked.

30
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,760
To mock somebody means to insult them by laughing at them in an unkind way.

31
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,280
But this hasn't discouraged fans who have started using new words and phrases to show they belong

32
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,640
to a particular fandom.

33
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:54,079
Here's Michael Bond again, explaining the meaning of two new words about the behaviour of

34
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:57,759
football fans to BBC Radio 4 programme, Word of Mouse.

35
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,959
Academics who study fandoms, they love to use acronyms and abbreviations, and they've got

36
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,519
several phrases which they use to describe the behaviour of football fans and burging.

37
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,519
So that means basking in reflected glory.

38
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,319
Oh, I love that.

39
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,959
When your team wins, everyone wants a bit of the action you take to the streets, dance around,

40
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,519
and so the subantithesis of that is core thing, which means cutting off reflected failure.

41
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,879
And that is what people sometimes do when their team loses, and they don't want to be associated

42
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,719
with that loss, that sense of failure.

43
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,680
Burging is made of an acronym of the words basking in reflected glory.

44
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,000
It means feeling good about yourself when the football team use support wins.

45
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:53,840
Fans say we won, even though it was the players on the pitch, not the fans who scored the goal.

46
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,360
When their team wins, fans cheer and want a piece of the action, an idiom meaning that they take

47
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:08,000
parts in celebrations and other exciting group activities and feel the success of the team

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,439
as a personal success.

49
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,800
The opposite of burging is core thing, another acronym, this time of the words

50
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,120
cutting off reflected failure.

51
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,839
Core thing involves distancing yourself from the team you support when they lose.

52
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,040
Instead of saying we won, you say they played rubbish.

53
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,839
Of course, true fans never core. In fact, some football fans take a kind of strange

54
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,399
pessimistic pleasure when their team loses week after week.

55
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,000
I can't imagine that's true of the Americans you mentioned, Beth,

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,279
so what was the correct answer to your question?

57
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,679
I asked who the original word fan was used to describe.

58
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:56,479
You said it was fans of Disney cartoons, which was the wrong answer I'm afraid.

59
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,599
Actually, it was baseball fans or fanatics as they were called at the time.

60
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:06,719
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt starting with, like,

61
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,840
minded, an adjective describing people who share similar opinions, ideas or interests.

62
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,120
Quirky means odd or unusual, but in an attractive or interesting way.

63
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,920
If you mock someone, you insult and laugh at them in an unkind way.

64
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,000
Burging is short for basking in reflected glory.

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,320
It means feeling good about yourself when the team you support wins.

66
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:37,920
The opposite of this is coughing, an acronym of Cutting off Reflected Failure,

67
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,480
which means distancing yourself from your favourite team when they lose.

68
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,040
And finally, if you want a piece or a slice of the action,

69
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:53,279
you want to take part in a celebration or other exciting group activity to include yourself

70
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,600
in a collective success. Once again, our six minutes are up.
