00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,400
And I'm Sam. Here at 6 Minute English, we often discuss the new inventions and ideas

6
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,599
of scientists dream up to fight climate change.

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,839
Technologies like geoengineering, which could reduce global warming by reflecting sunlight

8
00:00:32,839 --> 00:00:34,239
back into space.

9
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,799
Often these ideas are controversial because scientists disagree over whether the technology

10
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:44,840
is possible and whether in some cases it could do more harm than good.

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,840
In this programme we'll be finding out about a new idea to collect lumps of precious metals

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,760
called nodules from the bottom of the ocean.

13
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:01,520
The idea, known as deep sea mining, could provide the metals like copper, nickel and cobalt,

14
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,080
which are needed for the green technology used in electric car batteries and other renewable

15
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,080
energy.

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,120
But could deep sea mining actually damage delicate ocean ecosystems as well?

17
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,480
We'll be hearing from two experts and learning some new vocabulary soon.

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,400
For first I have a question for you, Sam.

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:27,520
Mammals like dolphins and whales represent a tiny amount of all marine biodiversity, the

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,240
thousands of animal species living in the sea.

21
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,520
Even all the different types of fish combined make up less than 3% of all living things in

22
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,520
the ocean.

23
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,920
So, according to recent estimates by UNESCO oceanographers, how many different marine species

24
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,040
have their home in the ocean?

25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,240
Is it a 70,000, b, 170,000 or c, 700,000?

26
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,120
Our guests there are around 170,000 animal species living in the sea.

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,600
Okay, Sam, I'll reveal the answer at the end of the programme.

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,280
Deep sea mining is supported by some scientists because it could provide the raw materials,

29
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,719
especially metals, needed to power electric cars.

30
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:16,759
Bigs them is Bramley Merton, a professor of marine biology at Southampton's National

31
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,759
Oceanographic Centre.

32
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:24,120
Here he outlines the problem to BBC World Services Science in Action.

33
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,560
As in so many things in life, there's a real kind of paradox or a conundrum.

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,280
The global grid capacity by 2050 will have to increase by 3 times electrical car ownership,

35
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,000
to increase by a factor of 25, solar and wind generation is going to grow by a factor

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
of 100.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,960
All of these things which we need to do to decarbonise, going to require raw materials and metals

38
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,960
in particular.

39
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,000
So, as a society with faith with conundrum, we need to decarbonise.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,840
Professor Merton describes the situation using two words.

41
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,920
Firstly, he calls it a conundrum, a problem that is very difficult to solve.

42
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:10,280
He also calls it a paradox, a situation that seems impossible because it contains two

43
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,279
opposite ideas.

44
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:18,439
Deep sea mining could damage the ocean, but paradoxically, it might provide rare metals

45
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:21,199
needed to decarbonise the planet.

46
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:26,599
At the heart of the problem is that in the future, green activities like driving electric

47
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:32,639
cars and using solar power is going to increase by a factor of 100.

48
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:39,759
If something increases by a factor of a certain number, it becomes multiplied that many times.

49
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,439
But another marine biologist, Helen Scales, isn't convinced.

50
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:49,639
Here she explains her doubts to BBC World Service Science in action.

51
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:54,119
My concern at this point is that deep sea mining and deep sea nodules, but in particular,

52
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:58,799
are being seen as a silver bullet to solve the climate crisis.

53
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,719
In such a way as well that we can hopefully rely on life carrying on pretty much as normal.

54
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,719
My concern is that it really will be opening a door to something much more than those tests.

55
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,880
It's leading down a rather slippery slope, I think, towards this

56
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,519
getting permission for deep sea mining to be open on a commercial scale.

57
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,920
Helen worries that deep sea mining will be seen as a silver bullet to the climate crisis,

58
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,920
a simple and instant solution to a complicated problem.

59
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,280
She thinks the tests which have been permitted to assess the difficulty of mining underwater

60
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,000
could open the door to mining on a large scale, which would damage fragile marine ecosystems

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,360
beyond repair.

62
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,439
If you open the door to something, you allow something new to start or make it possible.

63
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:51,120
Helen thinks that starting deep sea mining leads down a slippery slope,

64
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,439
a situation or habit that is difficult to stop and is likely to get worse and worse.

65
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:01,279
And that could spell the end for thousands of marine animals and plant species.

66
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,759
Yes, our oceans need protection as much as our land and skies,

67
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,199
which reminds me of my question, Sam.

68
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:12,480
Yes, you asked me how many different marine species live in the ocean,

69
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,920
and I guessed it was B, 170,000.

70
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,560
Which was the wrong answer, I'm afraid.

71
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,800
There are estimated to be around 700,000 marine species,

72
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,879
only about 226,000 of which have been identified so far.

73
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,360
OK, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from the programme,

74
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,240
starting with conundrum.

75
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,720
A problem that's very difficult to fix.

76
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,439
A paradox describes a situation that seems impossible,

77
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:43,280
because it contains two opposite ideas.

78
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,680
If something grows by a factor of 10, it becomes multiplied 10 times.

79
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,040
The term a silver bullet means a simple solution to a complicated problem,

80
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,199
often a solution that doesn't actually exist.

81
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,400
A slippery slope is a situation or a course of action that is difficult to stop

82
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,879
and is likely to get worse and worse.

83
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,120
And finally, the idiom to open the door to something

84
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,360
means to allow something new to start or to make it possible.

85
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,079
Once again, our six minutes are up. Bye for now.

86
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,079
Goodbye.

87
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,680
