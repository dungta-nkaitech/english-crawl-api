Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And I'm Sam. In this programme we'll be hearing about the extraordinary life of a well-known BBC journalist, Furgle Keen.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
As a BBC war correspondent, Furgle witnessed some of the most violent events in recent history.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Furgle's reporting helped his television audiences make sense of the horrors of war, but underneath there were more personal reasons attracting him to the front line.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Despite the danger, Furgle found himself going back again and again to report from war zones.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It gave him something he couldn't get anywhere else, a massive rush of adrenaline.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And Furgle started to worry that he was becoming addicted to war.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:13,000
In his new book The Madness, a memoir of war, fear and PTSD, Furgle discusses living with PTSD or post-traumatic stress disorder,

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
a type of psychological suffering that results from witnessing extreme violence.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We'll hear about some key events in Furgle's life and, as usual, we'll be learning some new vocabulary as well.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But first I have a question for you, Sam. The term PTSD is quite new, but descriptions of the mental suffering of war go back to ancient times.

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Something similar to PTSD is mentioned in Viking sagas and in stories about both world wars.

14
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So what was the name of the PTSD-like condition suffered by many soldiers during the First World War?

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Was it A, nostalgia, B, shell shock or C, combat stress?

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I think the answer is shell shock.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Okay, Sam, I'll reveal the answer later in the program.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Furgle Keen, who was born in Ireland, had seen violence ever since the early days of his career covering the fighting in Belfast.

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He had already reported from wars all over the world, when in 1994 he was sent to cover the Civil War in Rwanda.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But what Furgle saw there shocked him like nothing before.

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
As he told Mobine Azhar, presenter of BBC World Service program, lives less ordinary.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And I began to have nightmares of Rwanda.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And of course at that stage, you know, it was obvious that I was traumatized, but again, did I got a psychiatrist?

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No, I didn't. I kept doing the job.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Did you turn to other things?

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Boos.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Boos. I mean how much booze are we talking?

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You know, the truth is I was in an alcoholic language before I got to Rwanda.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But I was in the kind of functioning alcoholic, what they call, you know, managing it, stage of the disease.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
When Furgle returned home from Rwanda, he started having nightmares, obsessing and frightening dreams.

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It was obvious he was traumatized from the violence he had seen, but still Furgle didn't go to a psychiatrist, a medical doctor who specialises in treating mental illness.

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Instead Furgle turned to booze, an informal name for alcohol.

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Furgle had been addicted to alcohol before he arrived in Rwanda, but now he had another addiction to cope with.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The need to keep returning to war. Furgle knew it wasn't healthy, but he couldn't stop.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Around the year 2001, it seemed that war was everywhere, and Furgle kept on reporting.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
In Sudan, Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon.

37
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But the nightmares didn't stop, and his mental health got worse and worse.

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Here Furgle takes up the story with BBC World Service Programme, lives less ordinary.

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
A reach a point where I can't carry that anymore.

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And it's not dramatic, it's a slow, steady erosion.

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And that ends with a breakdown and admission to hospital.

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And this time, diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And fulfilling the kind of essential criteria as the psychiatrist,

44
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:35,000
so much of hypervigilance, nightmares, flashbacks, more nightmares than flashbacks.

45
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And the sense of being under threat and anger.

46
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
How did you feel?

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Relief, I think. You know, there's a name to this.

48
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You might expect Furgle to call it a day at this point, but that's not how addiction works.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He just kept getting pulled back in.

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Furgle had a nervous breakdown, a period of acute mental illness, leaving him unable to cope with life.

51
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
After the terrible things Furgle had witnessed, you might expect him to call it a day,

52
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
a phrase meaning to decide to stop what you're doing.

53
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But Furgle's addiction made that impossible.

54
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
After his diagnosis of PTSD, he got support and was able to stay away from booze and war.

55
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay, it's time to reveal the answer to my question.

56
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I asked about the name of the PTSD-like condition suffered by soldiers during World War I.

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And I said it was shell shock.

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Which was the correct answer.

59
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from the extraordinary life of Furgle Keen,

60
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
the war correspondent who suffered PTSD or post-traumatic stress disorder,

61
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
a mental illness experienced after violent or shocking events.

62
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
A nightmare is an upsetting or frightening dream.

63
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Psychiatrist is a type of doctor who specialises in mental illness.

64
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Booze is slang for alcohol.

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
A breakdown is an acute period of psychological illness,

66
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
leaving you unable to cope with life.

67
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And finally, the phrase call it a day means to stop what you're doing because you no longer want to.

68
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Once again, our six minutes are up. Good bye for now.

69
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Goodbye.
