Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,920
And I'm Sam.

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,760
In English, there are many expressions which use an adjective to compare humans with animals.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,199
For example, you might say she's as busy as a bee.

7
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,519
As hungry as a horse.

8
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,039
But you probably won't hear someone say she's as clever as a chimpanzee.

9
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:39,920
Which is strange because of all the animals.

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,239
It's our close cousins chimpanzees or chimps for short who are most like us.

11
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,920
Just like humans chimps are highly intelligent.

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,239
They live in social groups and just like humans these groups have leaders.

13
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,000
Also like humans chimps have a desire for power.

14
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,719
In fact, chimpanzees have their own politics, which is surprisingly similar to human politics,

15
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:06,719
as we'll be discovering in this programme.

16
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,960
Research shows that the reason chimpanzee behaviour so closely resembles human politics

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,840
is because biologically we are almost identical.

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,920
Did you know that a chimpe is more like a human than like a gorilla?

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,879
So Sam, my quiz question is this.

20
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,480
Biologically, how close are chimpanzees to humans?

21
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,560
Is it a 79% b 89% or c 99%?

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,960
Well, near if chimps and humans are almost identical, I'll guess c 99%.

23
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,719
Okay, Sam, we'll find out the correct answer at the end of the programme.

24
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,520
In human societies, of course, not everyone gets to be a political leader.

25
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,920
It's usually the most powerful or ambitious person who becomes president.

26
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,000
In chimpanzee society, this is called the alpha male.

27
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,000
The most successful and powerful male who leads the group.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Professor Franz DeVal is an expert on chimpanzee behaviour.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,520
Here he is on BBC World Service programme, the wife actor,

30
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,599
telling presenter James Tilley about one example of chimped behaviour,

31
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,000
which closely mirrors human politics.

32
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,640
All the males who are over the hill and cannot be alpha male anymore,

33
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,560
they start grooming a certain young male who they think has a future

34
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,280
and they may end up making that young male the alpha male,

35
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,439
with their help, meaning that they are essential to the power of that young male.

36
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:33,680
But then the power behind the throne, really.

37
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,120
Yeah, these older males, and you see that in human politics all the time,

38
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,439
these older males who have a lot of influence still.

39
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:46,640
Professor DeVal calls chimps who are too old to be alpha males over the hill,

40
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,680
a phrase describing someone who is old and no longer useful or attractive.

41
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,200
Older chimps try to control younger males in order to maintain their own power and influence.

42
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,240
In other words, they are the power behind the throne,

43
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,280
an expression meaning someone with no official power,

44
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,240
but who secretly controls things in the background.

45
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:15,040
Another example of chimped politics is when several weaker males gang up and overthrow a stronger alpha male.

46
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,520
By working together weaker chimps can increase their power and the benefits,

47
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,840
like food, which power brings.

48
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,840
According to Simon Hicks, Professor of Political Science at the London School of Economics,

49
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,640
human alliances work in exactly the same way.

50
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,520
Here is Professor Hicks speaking with BBC World Service Programme, the wife actor.

51
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,680
So for example, if you imagine three parties in a parliament, one big one and two small ones,

52
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,600
you might think that naturally the most likely coalition is the big party with either one of

53
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,680
the two small ones, or as in fact a minimum winning coalition prediction would suggest the two

54
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,919
smaller ones should get together if together they can reach more than 50% of the seas,

55
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,319
because they can divide up the spoils between the two of them, whereas if either one of them

56
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,159
formed a coalition with the big party, the big party would dominate and they wouldn't get many of

57
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:09,120
the spoils for themselves. Professor Hicks recommends that smaller political parties get together,

58
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,919
join together in a group to combine their power.

59
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:19,199
These smaller parties could form a coalition, a collection of different political groups who unite

60
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:25,120
for a limited time to form a government. In human politics making coalitions improves your

61
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,039
chances of winning an election. And in chimpanzee politics coalitions are a good way for young male

62
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:38,959
chimps to defeat the alpha male and divide up the spoils between themselves. Here the word spoils

63
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:44,319
means the benefits obtained by winning a war or being in a strong position.

64
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:50,399
For ambitious alpha chimps the spoils might include getting first choice of food and female partners.

65
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,959
Well for human politicians power can bring wealth and fame as well.

66
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:59,279
And there's something else alpha chimpanzees and human politicians have in common,

67
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,399
they like to show off their softer side by kissing babies.

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,399
It looks like chimps and humans share many similar behaviors after all,

69
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:14,799
which reminds me of your quiz question Neil. Yes in my quiz question I ask Sam how similar we are

70
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:22,719
to chimps. What did you say Sam? I said that biologically speaking we are C, 99% the same.

71
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:26,159
Which is the correct answer well done Sam you are as clever as a chimps.

72
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:33,759
Thanks Neil and you're definitely not over the hill. Let's recap the recovery from today's program

73
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:41,199
about chimps politics starting with alpha male, the most successful and powerful male in any group.

74
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:47,120
Over the hill is used to describe someone who is old and no longer useful or attractive.

75
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:54,159
Someone who is the power behind the throne secretly controls things but has no official power.

76
00:05:54,159 --> 00:06:00,240
Get together means join together as a group. A coalition is one different political groups,

77
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,759
temporarily unite to form a government. And finally the spoils are benefits or

78
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,680
advantages gained by winning a war. And that's all for this program, bye for now. Goodbye.
