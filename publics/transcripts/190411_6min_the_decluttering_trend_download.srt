From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,280
Hello, this is 6 Minute English. I'm Rob.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,480
And I'm Neil.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,280
Now Neil, are you a tidy person?

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,879
Me? Oh dear, no. You should see my floor-drobe.

9
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,240
Your floor-drobe?

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,039
Yes.

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,599
Tidy people keep their clothes in a wardrobe.

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,879
I just dump a lot of my clothes on the floor.

13
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:33,119
So, a floor-drobe.

14
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,159
Ah, yes. Well, it sounds as if you could use a bit of decluttering.

15
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:41,359
Clutter is the word for general mess and untidyness.

16
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:43,840
When you have too many things, too much stuff.

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,679
These days, the idea of decluttering is very popular.

18
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,600
Ooh, I love a good declutter.

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,679
Trouble is, I hate throwing things away.

20
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,320
Well, we might have some advice for you in today's programme.

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,200
But first, a question. It's about cleaning up.

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,960
The vacuum cleaner is a machine we use to clean our houses.

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,079
When were the first mechanical floor cleaners,

24
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:07,040
which later became vacuum cleaners, invented?

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,799
Was it A, the 1860s, B, the 1890s, or C, the 1920s?

26
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,840
Well, you know what? I have no idea.

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,719
So, I'll say the 1890s.

28
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,760
Okay, well, I'll have the answer later in the programme.

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,880
The decluttering techniques of Marie Kondo are very popular these days.

30
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,840
A UK decluttering expert, Leslie Spellman, appeared on the BBC Radio programme

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,240
You and Yours to discuss the topic.

32
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,600
She was asked to describe the basics of the Marie Kondo method.

33
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,880
What's the first thing she recommends people start with?

34
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,280
She basically says you have to do things in a certain order.

35
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,800
You have to start with your clothes, then you move onto your books,

36
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,560
then you move onto paperwork, then you go onto something called kimono,

37
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,879
which is kind of everything else, kitchens, bathrooms,

38
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,560
garages, laughs, etc.

39
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,719
And then finally, you tackle sentimental things.

40
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,759
She says that you have to start with your clothes before moving on through different categories of clutter.

41
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,960
The verb she uses for dealing with these things is to tackle.

42
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,159
To tackle something means to deal with it to sort it out.

43
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,000
And the last things she says you need to tackle are sentimental things.

44
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,759
These are things that you have an emotional connection to,

45
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,080
such as old letters and photographs.

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,680
I have to say those are the things I find most difficult to get rid of.

47
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,439
I'm very sentimental like that.

48
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,919
I think you just have to be ruthless, Rob.

49
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,759
Either that or buy a bigger house.

50
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,159
Right, let's listen to Leslie Spellman again.

51
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,080
She basically says you have to do things in a certain order.

52
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,520
You have to start with your clothes, then you move onto your books,

53
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,360
then you move onto paperwork, then you go onto something called kimono,

54
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,240
which is kind of everything else, kitchens, bathrooms, garages,

55
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,360
lofts, etc.

56
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,520
And then finally, you tackle sentimental things.

57
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,560
So why is it that decluttering is such big business these days

58
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,320
and there are many people and companies offering advice and services?

59
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,960
Here's Leslie Spellman again with her thoughts on this.

60
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,000
I think there's been a big shift really.

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,360
So my generation, my parents, you know, definitely came from that make-do,

62
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,400
a mendier, a post war in the sort of 20th century.

63
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,039
And then all of a sudden people started to get a little bit more money,

64
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,719
things became more affordable.

65
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,319
You can buy five tops for five pounds each and people have done that.

66
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,560
And that's allowed the consumerism to kind of go crazy in the 21st century.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,439
So what does she put our need for decluttering down to?

68
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,120
Well, first she says that there has been a shift in our behaviour.

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,120
This is a way of saying that there has been a change in the way we behave.

70
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,759
We used to make do and mend much more.

71
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:42,879
This phrase means that we made full use of what we had

72
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,120
and if something broke we tried to fix it.

73
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,039
And these days we seem to have more money and many goods have got cheaper

74
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,799
than we just like buying stuff.

75
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,000
Or as she says, consumerism has gone crazy.

76
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,599
Let's listen to her again.

77
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,319
I think there's been a big shift really.

78
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,599
So my generation, my parents, you know, definitely came from that make-do,

79
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,719
a mendier, a post war in the sort of 20th century.

80
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:07,359
And then all of a sudden people started to get a little bit more money,

81
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,040
things became more affordable.

82
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,560
You can buy five tops for five pounds each and people have done that.

83
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,879
And that's allowed the consumerism to kind of go crazy in the 21st century.

84
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,080
Time to tidy up today's vocabulary.

85
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,480
But first, let's have the answer to the question.

86
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,120
Earlier I asked you, when were the first mechanical floor cleaners invented?

87
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,520
Was it in A, the 1860s, B, the 1890s or C, the 1920s?

88
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,480
And Neil, you said...

89
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,639
I guessed at the 1890s.

90
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,639
Sadly not, the correct answer is the 1860s.

91
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,280
So well done to anyone who got that right.

92
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,000
Now on with today's vocabulary, the first where we had was floor-drobe.

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,319
Yes, this is a word to describe a pile of clothes that someone keeps on the floor,

94
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,319
rather than in a wardrobe.

95
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,160
Well, I don't have a floor-drobe, but I do have a chair-drobe.

96
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,240
I guess you can work out what that means.

97
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,759
Anyway, it seems we both have too much clutter,

98
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,199
which is the untidyness caused by having too many things.

99
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,479
And this leads us to the popular pastime of decluttering,

100
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,719
which is throwing away things to make our homes neat and tidy.

101
00:05:14,719 --> 00:05:18,079
Clutter, in my life, is an issue I haven't tackled yet.

102
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,639
I haven't tried to fix it or sort it out.

103
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,360
One area that the experts say you need to tackle is sentimental things.

104
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,319
These are things which you have an emotional connection to,

105
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:30,959
maybe old letters and photographs, for example.

106
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,360
We then looked at the word shift, which was a way of saying change.

107
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,360
There has been a shift or a change in the way we think about things.

108
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,480
Yes, rather than an attitude of make-do-and-mend,

109
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,600
which means an attitude of being content with what you've got

110
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,520
and fixing things if they break,

111
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,920
we've become part of a consumerist culture

112
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,879
where we like to buy more and more stuff.

113
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,439
But we still find it hard to throw things away.

114
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,319
Yes, indeed we do.

115
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,080
Well, it's time for us to collect our scripts and declutter the studio.

116
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,840
We look forward to your company next time,

117
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,040
and until then, you can find us in all the usual places online

118
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,240
and on social media.

119
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,319
Just look for BBC Learning English.

120
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,120
Bye for now.

121
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,840
Bye-bye.
