Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Georgina

5
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,920
and I'm Neil. In this program we're going to be talking about the world of work.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,839
Ah yes, traveling to an office five days a week, sitting at a desk all day and then going home.

7
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,280
Neil, it's not always like that. Office work doesn't have to be such a routine,

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,519
the usual fix way of doing things. It is much more flexible these days.

9
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,359
That's true. During the pandemic we've all had to have a more flexible approach to work.

10
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,799
Yes, we have and it has perhaps changed our attitude to working flexibly.

11
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:54,480
But even before coronavirus there was an opportunity to work flexibly and we'll be discussing

12
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,599
that soon. But there's one thing that can't be changed and that's you setting a quiz question.

13
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,319
Ah yes, I hadn't forgotten. So Neil, I know you work very hard, but according to data from

14
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:13,519
the organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the OECD, workers from which country

15
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:21,519
work the longest hours. Is it a South Korea, B Germany or C Mexico?

16
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,479
Well, as I'm not on the list, let's go for C Mexico.

17
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:32,560
Okay, now we'll find out if that's right at the end of the programme, but let's talk more about

18
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,319
flexible working now. Different countries have different laws about working flexibly.

19
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:45,840
But here in the UK for the last 14 years, employees, workers have had the right to request flexible

20
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,480
working. But what does it mean to work flexibly? Sarah Jackson is a workplace consultant and

21
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,400
visiting professor at Cranfield University School of Management. She spoke to BBC Radio 4's

22
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,640
Woman's Hour programme about what it means exactly. Because of the pandemic now,

23
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,319
everybody thinks that flexible working means working from home. It's about common sense.

24
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,319
What does the job need in terms of when, where, how long, and what do you need, what does your

25
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,719
family need and how do they do it? So flexibility really means having some choice and control

26
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,799
over when, where, and how long you work and agreeing that with your manager.

27
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,719
So flexible working is not just working from home, something we've got used to during the pandemic.

28
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,359
It is about common sense, using our judgement to make sensible decisions.

29
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:43,840
So requesting to work for two hours a day is not sensible, but being able to work from 12 until

30
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,879
eight instead of nine to five might be. Of course, this depends on the needs of the business,

31
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,240
and as Sarah said, you need to match your needs with that of the business. Match here means to work

32
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,439
equally on both sides. Getting the working conditions that suit you does require some

33
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:05,439
negotiation with your manager. You need agreement from him or her, and that can be difficult if your

34
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:12,000
manager is inflexible, not willing to change. But of course, in the UK at least, an employee has a

35
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,919
right to request flexible working, and this must be considered by the employer. This law initially

36
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:23,599
was just for parents with a child younger than six years old or a disabled child less than 18.

37
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:30,560
But since 2014, everyone has the right to request flexible working, and that includes men.

38
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,560
Which is an important point as Sarah Jackson explains, fewer men seem to have their requests for

39
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:44,159
flexible working accepted. Let's find out why. Men when they do ask them more likely to be turned down.

40
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:50,400
So there's a real bias there in the system. And so what the most important thing that needs to happen

41
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,000
here, I think, is for employers to really actively start saying to their men, we know you want to be

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,920
active fathers, because there's a whole generation of young men who do want to be active fathers.

43
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,240
Please use the right to request flexible working work work flexibly if you can, because until

44
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,360
men are enabled to be active fathers, we won't get equality at home and we certainly won't get

45
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,240
equality in the workplace either. Okay, so men are more likely to have their requests turned down

46
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:25,280
or rejected. And Sarah says there is a bias in the system, unfairness treating one group of people

47
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,280
more favourably than another. And this is unfair because it can prevent some men being active

48
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:37,039
fathers actually being involved with childcare, but having more active fathers can lead to equality

49
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:42,799
or fairness at home and in the workplace. It sounds like something that needs to be looked at,

50
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:48,639
but now Neil, let's get the answer to my question. According to official data in which country

51
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:57,119
do workers work the longest hours? And I said Mexico. Which is correct? Well done. According to the OECD,

52
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:06,079
the average Mexican spends 2,255 hours at work per year, the equivalent of around 43 hours per week.

53
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,160
Germans on the other hand clock up the fewest hours. Well, my working day is nearly over,

54
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,319
so let's just recap some of the vocabulary we've discussed. Starting with routine, the usual fixed

55
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:25,120
way of doing things. Common sense is our judgment to make sensible decisions. When you need something

56
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,360
to match, it has to work equally on both sides. And when someone is inflexible, they are unwilling

57
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:38,079
to change. Sometimes we say they won't budge. Bias is unfairness treating one group of people

58
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:43,120
more favourably than another. And being active with something means being involved with it.

59
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,720
Well, there's no flexibility in our six minutes, so we're out of time. We have plenty more
