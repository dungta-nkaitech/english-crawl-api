Hello, this is 6 Minute English, I'm Sam.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,600
And I'm Rob.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,240
Before you got your first job, Rob, did you do any work experience?

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,160
I think I've done a day or two at some companies,

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,039
just shadowing, watching how they did things,

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,039
but nothing much more than that.

9
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,879
Hmm, some companies offer students or recent graduates

10
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:36,960
what they call internships.

11
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:40,240
These are extended periods of work experience

12
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,039
where someone can be working full-time

13
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:45,120
without an actual contract.

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,840
And in many cases, without even being paid.

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,560
Ah, yes, this is a bit of a problem, isn't it?

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,560
Some companies are being accused of using students and graduates

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,399
as cheap or free labour.

18
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,600
Yes, although the counter-argument is that internships

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,640
are valuable experience for people who need it

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,120
before they can get a real job.

21
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,840
Well, we'll look at this topic a little more

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,840
after this week's quiz question.

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,719
On the topic of business and companies,

24
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,560
which is the oldest stock exchange in the world?

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,680
Is it A, Bombay, B, New York, or C, Amsterdam?

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,719
What do you think, Rob?

27
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,319
Ah, tricky, because I was expecting London on that list.

28
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,359
I'm going to take a guess then at Amsterdam.

29
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,560
Okay, well, I will reveal the answer later in the programme.

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,280
James Turner is the chief executive of an education charity.

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,599
Recently, he took part in a discussion on the BBC Radio programme

32
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,719
You and Yours on the topic of internships.

33
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,400
What does he think is a big issue with unpaid internships?

34
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,079
In many careers, we're now seeing that it's almost an expectation

35
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,920
that a young person doesn't internship

36
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,640
before they stand a chance of getting that first full-time job

37
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,759
in that profession.

38
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,359
And the issue with that from a social mobility point of view

39
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,560
is that substantial proportion of those internships are unpaid

40
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,800
and that effectively rules out those who can't afford to work for free.

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,159
So what is the problem with unpaid internships, Rob?

42
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,639
Well, if you can't afford to work for free,

43
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,240
it makes it very difficult to do an internship,

44
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,879
particularly in expensive cities like London.

45
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,479
This excludes or rules out a lot of people

46
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,319
from the benefits of an internship.

47
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,359
This is bad for social mobility,

48
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:34,400
which is the ability of people to move to higher,

49
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
better paid levels in society.

50
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:42,159
So the poorer you are, the more difficult it can be to get a good job,

51
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,599
even if you have the ability.

52
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,800
Could you afford to work for free here in London Sam?

53
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,639
No, I can barely afford to live in London as it is.

54
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,679
So the idea of doing an unpaid internship

55
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:55,519
would not appeal to me at all.

56
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:58,639
Turner goes on to talk about other issues

57
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,439
that are also problematic in internship programmes.

58
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,119
Too often internships are open to those

59
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:07,679
with established connections in the professions.

60
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:09,679
And again, that rules out those young people

61
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:12,879
who don't have the well-connected families or friends

62
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,319
who can open those doors for them.

63
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,719
So what are these other issues?

64
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:20,239
In many cases, he says that internship opportunities

65
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,240
are only available to those with established connections

66
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,240
to the company or industry.

67
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,600
This means they have some pre-existing link with the company,

68
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,800
for example, through family or friends families.

69
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,840
Yes, it's a lot easier if your family is well-connected.

70
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,080
If it has a lot of contacts and links to a particular company

71
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,640
or important people in that company.

72
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,960
These links make it easier to open doors to the opportunity.

73
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,640
To open doors is an expression that means to get access to.

74
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,320
So it seems that to be able to do an unpaid internship,

75
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,480
you need to have a fair bit of money

76
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,960
and to get an internship in the first place,

77
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,760
you may need to have a previous link to the company

78
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,840
through a family connection, for example.

79
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,240
So the system would seem to be difficult for poorer families

80
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,319
and make it more difficult for students

81
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,879
without those resources or connections

82
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,640
to get on the job ladder.

83
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,079
Here's James Turner again.

84
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,439
Too often internships are open to those

85
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:21,919
with established connections in the professions.

86
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,919
And again, that rules out those young people

87
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,120
who don't have the well-connected families or friends

88
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,560
who can open those doors for them.

89
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,479
Right, time now to answer this week's question.

90
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,519
Which is the oldest stock exchange in the world?

91
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,799
Is it A, Bombay, B, New York or C, Amsterdam?

92
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:42,240
Rob, what did you say?

93
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,079
I went for Amsterdam.

94
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,399
Well done, that's correct.

95
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,120
Congratulations to everyone who got that right.

96
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,479
An extra bonus point, if you know the date, Rob.

97
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:55,279
Having a clue, 1750?

98
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,800
Hmm, actually it's a lot earlier, 1602.

99
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,799
Wow, that's much earlier than I thought.

100
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,079
Right, let's have a look again at today's vocabulary.

101
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,799
We've been talking about internships,

102
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:09,120
which are periods of work at companies as a way

103
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,680
for students or new graduates to get experience

104
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,519
in a particular field.

105
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,919
If they're unpaid, it can make social mobility very difficult.

106
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,439
This is the movement from a lower social level to a higher one,

107
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,680
and it's difficult as poorer candidates

108
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,919
can't afford to work for free.

109
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,639
Yes, the cost rules them out.

110
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,359
It excludes them from the opportunity.

111
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:35,919
What helps is if you have established connections with a company.

112
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,079
This refers to previous or pre-existing links with a company.

113
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,799
And also if your family is well connected,

114
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,360
if it has good connections, for example,

115
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,600
if your father plays golf with the CEO, it can open doors.

116
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,439
Or in other words, it can make it easier to get into the company.

117
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,680
So, Sam, are you well connected?

118
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,759
Ah, no, only to my smartphone.

119
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,120
Ah, same here.

120
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,000
But we still made it to BBC Learning English,

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,560
and you can find more from us online on social media and on a app.

122
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,120
But for now, that's all from six minute English.

123
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,720
See you again soon. Bye-bye.

124
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,920
Bye, everyone.

125
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,560
Six minute English.
