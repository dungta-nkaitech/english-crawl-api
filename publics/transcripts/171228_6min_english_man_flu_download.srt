From BBC Learning English

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,960
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Dan and joining me today is Neil Heineel.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,160
Hi everyone.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,679
Huh?

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:20,960
Huh?

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,480
Uh, a chew!

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,400
Bless you. Are you okay?

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,199
I think I'm coming down with something serious.

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,879
It's just a case of the sniffles.

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,200
The sniffles is an informal way of saying a cold or flu.

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,799
It comes from the sniffing sound people make when they have a runny nose.

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,359
Yeah, and a runny nose is when liquid mucus keeps leaking from our nose.

16
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,039
Usually when we're sick.

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,840
I'm afraid you'll just have to soldier on, Neil.

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,120
To soldier on means to continue despite difficulty.

19
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:53,120
Oh, dying!

20
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,960
What's it about anyway?

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,640
It's about man-flu, and whether it's actually real or

22
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,679
just something that men like to complain about.

23
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,439
We'll give you six words and expressions and of course, our quiz question.

24
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,640
All right, fire away.

25
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,200
In a survey conducted by Nuts magazine that asked its readers how long they took to recover

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,680
from a cold or flu, where women put an average of one and a half days, what did men put?

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,599
Was it A one day, B two days or C three days?

28
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:25,920
I'm going to say three days.

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,159
The threat of mad flu is real.

30
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,679
Well, we'll find out later, but let's clarify.

31
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:38,000
Man-flu is the tendency that many people believe men have to complain about a minor illness,

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,799
such as a cold or flu, and act as if they were suffering from something a lot more serious.

33
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,199
Yes, but science cannot say whether men do actually suffer more than women

34
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:51,599
or if men just tend to complain more.

35
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,479
Let's hear from this British couple about whether they think man-flu is real or not.

36
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,119
Men definitely do suffer a lot more, I think, than women do when we get flu.

37
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,280
Yeah, I'm not so convinced. I feel like they just complain more.

38
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,120
I was ill recently and I just carried on and went to work and everything and when Chris

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,319
had got sick recently, he was on the sofa and couldn't really do anything so.

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,000
And it seems that it's not just in the UK.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,280
Listen to this BBC journalist interviewing a woman from Europe.

42
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,639
You're from the Netherlands. Have you ever accused your boyfriend of having man flu?

43
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:29,519
Absolutely, yes. What have you accused him of doing?

44
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,199
Wining?

45
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:38,479
Wining is when someone complains repeatedly and often in an annoying way about something.

46
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:44,000
So there certainly seems to be something there, but nothing has been proven, right?

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,759
Well, a recent scientific study has indicated that there could be something to man-flu after all.

48
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:56,560
Dr. Kyle Sue, an assistant professor of family medicine at Memorial University of Newfoundland

49
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,000
in Canada has suggested that there could be a difference between men and women when it comes

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,840
to respiratory diseases. Respiratory, meaning related to breathing.

51
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,000
He says that there was already a lot of evidence from existing studies

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,240
suggesting man experience worse, longer-lasting symptoms. Symptoms are the feelings of illness

53
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,240
caused by a disease. Listen to him explain why this is.

54
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,439
It seems that higher the testosterone levels lower the immune response to these types of

55
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:32,719
infections, whereas the higher the estrogen level, the stronger the immune response.

56
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:38,080
Testosterone and estrogen are hormones that exist in both men and women.

57
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,280
Testosterone is higher in males and estrogen is higher in females. Dr. Sue's research

58
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,879
suggests that the more estrogen a person has, the better able they are to fight off the infection.

59
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,000
That's it then. Man-flu is real. Hold your horses, Neil. There are two problems.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,639
First of all, the Royal College of GPs in the UK says that there is no such thing as man-flu.

61
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:08,159
And secondly, even Dr. Sue admits that these results, including his own, are only suggestive

62
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,919
and not definitive. So basically, he's saying that there is a suggestion that man-flu exists

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,519
that the evidence so far cannot say for sure. Exactly. More studies need to be done.

64
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,680
But you know what we can be sure about. The answer to this week's quiz question.

65
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,560
I asked you in a survey conducted by Nuts magazine that asked its readers how long they took to

66
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,800
recover from a cold or flu, where women put an average of one and a half days, what did men put?

67
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:45,120
A, one day, B, two days or C, three days. And I said three days. And you were right. Good.

68
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,720
The men said they took twice as long to recover. It must be all that madly testosterone.

69
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,400
Let's review our vocabulary, shall we? Our first was the sniffles. If you have the sniffles,

70
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,040
you have a cold, informally speaking. What's the best cure for the sniffles, Neil?

71
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,080
Stay in bed and sweat it out, my mum always said. Just make sure you have lots of tissues to

72
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:11,039
deal with your runny nose. That's when a person's nose leaks mucus usually because they're ill.

73
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:19,519
Next we had soldier on. This phrasal verb means to continue despite difficulty. When was the last

74
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:25,199
time you had to soldier on, Neil? A few days ago when I went the whole day without eating any lunch,

75
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,479
then we had man-flu. That's the name given to the situation where a person, often a man,

76
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,759
tends to complain and exaggerate a small illness such as a cold. Do you do that, Dan?

77
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,480
I'm sure my wife would say I do. Next we had whining. If you whine, you complain repeatedly

78
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,480
and often in an annoying way. Like my children did last time I didn't buy them ice cream. Finally,

79
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:53,759
we had symptoms. These are the feelings of illness caused by a disease. What are the symptoms of

80
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,759
flu, Dad? A headache, aching muscles, oh, and a fever. That's the end of this six-minute English.

81
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,439
Don't forget to check out our YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages. There, you made it.

82
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,120
You can collapse now. Bye.
