00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:11,439
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

3
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:12,439
I'm Neil.

4
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:13,439
And I'm Georgie.

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,320
Do you know the five taste switch give food its flavour, Neil?

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,320
They're sweet.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,320
Yes.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,960
And sour, bitter.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,280
And salty.

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,800
Everyone knows that salt makes food taste better by enhancing the flavours of the ingredients.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,120
There's even a phrase you'll see in many recipes, add a pinch of salt.

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,399
But exactly how much salt makes a pinch of salt?

13
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:44,760
The World Health Organization, or WHO, recommends a daily salt intake of less than 5 grams,

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,000
about the same as a teaspoon.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,719
In fact, the human body needs salt, at least 1 gram a day to survive.

16
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:58,240
But most of us eat far too much, increasing the risk of high blood pressure and heart disease.

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,920
In this programme, we'll be asking, how much salt is too much?

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,680
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,680
Great.

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,240
But first, I have a question for you, Neil.

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,400
The reason it's difficult to know how much salt you consume is that it's hidden in a food,

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,480
especially processed food.

23
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,599
So which of the following everyday foods do you think contains most salt?

24
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:27,120
Is it A, meat, B, bread or C, pasta?

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,680
Well, I'm going to guess that meat is the saltiest of those foods.

26
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,600
OK, Neil, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,560
Marion Sambiva lives in Estana, the capital of Kazakhstan, a country where people eat on

28
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,880
average 17 grams of salt a day.

29
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,480
That's more than three times the amount recommended by the WHO.

30
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:56,120
Here, Marion explains some of the reasons behind this to BBC World Service programme, the Food Chain.

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:03,960
We consume lots of salt, which is due to historical heritage, because when we were normal

32
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,080
for centuries and centuries, we travelled and wandered across the steps.

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,599
And here we had to carry lots of meat, which could be preserved only adding salt.

34
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:24,920
And even the milk products, the dairy products are also very much salty for the same reasons.

35
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:30,159
Besides improving its flavour, salt can be used to preserve food, to stop it from going

36
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,159
bad.

37
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:34,399
Traditionally, people in Kazakhstan were nomads.

38
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:38,959
They travelled from place to place with their animals, rather than living in one place

39
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,560
all the time.

40
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,279
Treating food with salt gave them enough to eat during the long winter months.

41
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:50,679
They even did it with dairy products, foods which are made from milk, such as cheese and

42
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:51,679
butter.

43
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,879
So salt has a long and useful history, but there's a big difference between traditional

44
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,480
Kazakh nomads and the health problems associated with modern processed food.

45
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,840
When we eat too much salt, the body dilutes it by retaining water.

46
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,439
And as a result, the heart works harder to pump liquid around the body.

47
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:16,480
This causes high blood pressure, which over time can lead to heart disease.

48
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,800
Globally, governments are fighting this health risk in different ways.

49
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,120
The Australian government reduced its recommended salt intake to 6 grams a day, while the British

50
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,480
government has passed laws forcing food companies to reduce the amount of salt they use, and

51
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,920
now recommends just 5 grams of salt per day.

52
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,720
Claire Collins is professor of nutrition at the University of Newcastle in Australia.

53
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:45,560
Here, she explains more about these salt recommendations to BBC World Service programme,

54
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
the food chain.

55
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,120
I think you just got to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.

56
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,520
Like arguing whether it should be 5 grams or 6 grams, the issue is that around the world

57
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:02,280
salt intake is very high, contributing to blood pressure, contributing to premature

58
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:10,920
strokes, premature mortality, and we need to address it in a way that's culturally appropriate

59
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,400
for each country.

60
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,800
Instead of arguing over grams of salt, Professor Collins thinks we should take a step back and

61
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,639
look at the bigger picture.

62
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:25,680
She uses two idioms, take a step back, which means to temporarily withdraw from a situation

63
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,680
in order to think about it more calmly, and look at the bigger picture.

64
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,480
To consider the overall meaning of something, not just the details.

65
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:41,120
Yes, the problem remains that overconsumption of salt is causing premature health problems,

66
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,160
which are happening sooner than they should.

67
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,560
By limiting salt and processed food, most people can enjoy long, healthy lives.

68
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,399
And if you don't like your food unsalted, try adding herbs and spices instead.

69
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,399
Well, speaking of salty foods, I think it's time to reveal the answer to my question,

70
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,399
Neil.

71
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,920
If you remember, I asked you which everyday food contains most salt.

72
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,759
And I guessed it was meat.

73
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:09,560
Which was the correct answer.

74
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:17,160
Meat contains the highest amount of salt, around 19%, followed by bread with 14%, and pasta

75
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
with 7%.

76
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,439
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this program, starting with the verb

77
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:29,680
to preserve food, meaning to do something to stop it rotting so it can be eaten later.

78
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,840
No meds are people who travel from one place to another, often with animal livestock,

79
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,319
rather than living in one place all the time.

80
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,000
Dairy products are foods such as cheese and butter, which are made from milk.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,199
If you take a step back, you temporarily remove yourself from a situation in order to re-evaluate

82
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,199
it.

83
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,839
The idiom to look at the bigger picture means to consider the overall meaning of something

84
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,039
rather than the specific details.

85
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:01,360
And finally, the adjective premature describes something which happens too soon or before

86
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,159
the proper time.

87
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:04,600
Once again, our six minutes are up.

88
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Goodbye for now.

89
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Bye.
