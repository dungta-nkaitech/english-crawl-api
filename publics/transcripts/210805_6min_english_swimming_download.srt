6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish.com

10
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,799
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

11
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:42,799
I'm Neil.

12
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,799
And I'm Georgina.

13
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,759
Can you swim Georgina?

14
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:47,759
I can, Neil.

15
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:53,359
I learnt to swim as a child and now I enjoy swimming for exercise and to relax.

16
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:58,240
In the summer hundreds of keen swimmers like Georgina head off to swimming pools, lakes

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,039
and beaches to take a dip and informal idiom meaning go for a swim.

18
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:09,480
Swimming has many health benefits and since ancient times has been used to promote strength

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,480
and well-being.

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,319
But swimming is not just about exercise, there's far more to it beneath the surface as we'll

21
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,359
be finding out in this programme on the history of swimming.

22
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:25,120
Although evidence suggests that ancient Mediterranean people dived eagerly into temple

23
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,640
pleasure pools, lakes and the sea, other cultures have swam against the tide.

24
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,560
Another swimming idiom there, Neil, meaning not to follow what everyone else is doing.

25
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,039
Someone who did enjoy swimming was the poet Lord Byron.

26
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:45,359
He wrote poems popularising the sport and in 1810 swam the helispont, a stretch of

27
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,159
water separating Europe from Asia.

28
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,000
But in which modern country can the helispont be found, that's my quiz question Georgina.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,599
Is it A, Greece, B, Cyprus or C, Turkey?

30
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:04,599
I think Lord Byron visited Istanbul so I'll say C, Turkey.

31
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:09,039
Okay, we'll find out the answer at the end of the programme.

32
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,560
For all its good points, swimming seems to have lost its appeal in Europe after the decline

33
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,439
of the Roman Empire.

34
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:20,439
According to historian and swimming enthusiast Professor Kevin Dawson, the rise of Christian

35
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:28,359
beliefs discouraged swimming as he explains here to BBC World Service programme The Forum.

36
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:35,199
You have some beliefs that water is this unsafe space, unnatural space for human beings.

37
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:41,400
It's a perpetuation of the chaos that existed before God created land or that water is a mechanism

38
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,840
for punishment like the Great Flood Story or Pharaoh's army being destroyed in the Red Sea.

39
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,480
But then there's also beliefs that swimming is a modest.

40
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,640
I mean most people at the time swam nude and so church officials discourage swimming

41
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,840
because they felt that it led to in modest behaviour.

42
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,879
As well as being considered unsafe or chaotic, swimming was seen as immodest, shocking because

43
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,159
it shows too much of the body.

44
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:15,199
This was because most people at the time swam nude, naked without clothes.

45
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:20,800
Another place for the long history of swimming is the remote Maldives Islands in the Indian Ocean.

46
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,759
In the Maldives, access to shallow, warm sea water lakes, cordola goons makes it an unbeatable

47
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:28,800
place for swimming.

48
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,000
But even on a tropical island, things haven't always gone swimmingly, as diver and Maldives

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,120
resident Mick Eil Rosen told BBC World Service programme The Forum.

50
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,200
This and for the reason Mikhail Gibbs for the change in people's attitudes to swimming

51
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
in the Maldives.

52
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,599
No citizen of the Maldives has half a mile to a lukewarm lagoon.

53
00:03:51,599 --> 00:04:00,280
Given that they could be world eating in swimming, but in the 1960s, the government recruited

54
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,840
a lot of teachers from India, Sri Lanka.

55
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:11,159
They didn't know anything about the water culture and the notice that the young students

56
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,280
playing hooky, they were in the lagoons.

57
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,720
And swimming soon got frowned upon.

58
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:26,439
But now the government and the local organisations, they tried to reclaim swimming.

59
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,920
Did you hear the reason Mikhail Gibbs now?

60
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,280
Yes, he said that young students were playing hooky to go swimming in the lagoons.

61
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,000
Play hooky is an informal way of saying stay away from school without permission.

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,360
Right, and that meant swimming quickly got frowned upon or disapproved of.

63
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,120
It seems a bit unfair since there was already a strong culture of swimming in the Maldives,

64
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,600
which the arriving teachers didn't fully appreciate.

65
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,879
Well, I know which I'd rather do.

66
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:01,760
Sit in a classroom or swim in a warm tropical lagoon.

67
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
Swimming, right?

68
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,600
But then you would never have learned about Lord Byron.

69
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,920
Yes, in your quiz question you asked me about Lord Byron swimming the Hellerspont, a stretch

70
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,840
of water separating Europe from Asia.

71
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,280
I asked you in which country the Hellerspont can be found.

72
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,439
Is it A, Greece, B, Cyprus or C, Turkey?

73
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,280
What did you say?

74
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:25,079
I said C, Turkey.

75
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,079
Was I right?

76
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:31,639
Yes, you were Georgina, the Hellerspont, also known as the Straits of Dardanelles, is a six

77
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:34,559
kilometres wide stretch of water in Turkey.

78
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:40,279
Let's recap the vocabulary from this programme on swimming, which some people informally call

79
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:42,279
taking a dip.

80
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:47,199
Someone who swims against the tide refuses to do what everyone else is doing.

81
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,279
In the past, swimming was considered immodest, shocking because it showed too much of the

82
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,279
body.

83
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,000
Another word for naked or not wearing any clothes is nude.

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,439
Children who play hooky stay away from school without permission.

85
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:06,759
And finally if something is frowned upon, it's disapproved of.

86
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:10,839
That's all for our dive into the deep end of the vocabulary of swimming.

87
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:15,359
As we've discovered, there's plenty of idioms and expressions relating to swimming and

88
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:16,359
water.
