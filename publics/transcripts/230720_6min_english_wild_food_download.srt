Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish.com.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Beth.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And I'm Neil.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Nowadays, we are so used to getting food whenever we want that we've almost forgotten how we managed in the past.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But for thousands of years before supermarkets, humans found food through foraging,

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
moving from place to place, looking for wild food to eat.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Since the Covid pandemic, foraging for wild food has become popular again.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Why go to the shops when you can walk into nearby countryside and parks to collect edible plants, mushrooms and fruit for free?

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Of course, you can't eat everything you find growing outside. Some poisonous plants can make you very ill.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But there's something exciting about setting off on a culinary treasure hunt to find new edible plants for dinner.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
In this programme, we'll be hearing about a new foraging project taking place across the UK.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But first, I have a question for you, Neil.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
2019 was a good year for the group Wild Food UK.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
With the launch of their foraging pocket guide, a handbook aimed at helping foragers find and identify safe wild food to eat.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So according to the group's website, what is the most popular food foraged in the UK?

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Is it A, C-weed, B, berries or C mushrooms?

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Hmm, there's so much coastline in Britain, I reckon it must be A, C-weed.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay, I will reveal the answer later in the programme.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Monika Wild, known as Mo, is the author of The Wilderness Cure, a book charting her year of eating only wild food.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Mo is one of a group of 26 experienced foragers taking part in the Wild Bione project, a three-month experiment into the health benefits of introducing wild food.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And then, the third-year experiment of introducing wild food into your diet.

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Microbiome are tiny organisms, including bacteria and fungi, which live in the human digestive system.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Help break down food and strengthen immune defence.

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The idea is that natural, unprocessed foods found in the wild support our microbiome, leading to a range of health benefits from weight loss to increased energy levels.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The diet of the microbiome is measured and monitored before, during and after the experiment.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Here's Mo Wild, chatting with one of the foragers Rob Gould for BBC Radio 4's The Food programme.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Even if you don't buy into the whole idea of fully encompassing a wild diet, because for most people it's fairly much unattainable,

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:13,000
but for people just incorporating a small amount of wild food into their diet, you're increasing massively the amount of nutrients, the micronutrients and the vitamins that you're getting,

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
a lot of which aren't even available regularly in your commonly bought foods.

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Sometimes people say, oh well, you know, for everybody forage there wouldn't be enough, but I've never noticed a shortage of nettles.

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And if nettles didn't grow in this country, we'd probably be flying them in as a superfood, because they're so nutritious and above all they're free.

34
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
With the high levels of nutrients and vitamins found in wild plants like nettles, Rob has bought into the idea of foraging.

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
If you buy into an idea, you completely believe in it.

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Did you say stinging nettles, the wild plants growing everywhere, which have leaves covered in hairs that sting when you turn them into a tree,

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
stinging when you touch them?

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yes, it turns out that nettles are packed full of nutrients and vitamins, which are great for human health.

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:13,000
In fact, they're even considered a superfood. Food that contains many vitamins and other nutrients known to be very good for human health.

40
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The Wild Biome project hasn't finished yet, but it already seems that the foragers are feeling happier as well as healthier.

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:31,000
They all report greater appreciation for the smell and taste of their food, and say foraging has given them increased self-worth, a natural treatment for depression and anxiety.

42
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Here's one forager describing her feelings to BBC Radio 4's The Food Programme.

43
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Find the first week. I felt really quite flat, quite limited carbs coming in from chess, not flour primarily.

44
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Feeling loads better now, feeling loads better in the last few days, and I'm really enjoying the project having a great time.

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
In fact, I don't really want it to stop.

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
At the start of the experiment, this forager felt flat, low in energy, emotion or excitement.

47
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But after some weeks of wild food, fresh air and appreciation of nature, she doesn't want the project to stop.

48
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Well, I'm convinced. So what's first on my wild food shopping list? I think it's time you revealed the answer to your question, Beth.

49
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Right, I asked what was the most popular foraged food in the UK, and you guessed it was seaweed, which was the wrong answer.

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Mushrooms are the most popular foraged food.

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt from this programme about foraging, looking for wild edible plants to eat.

52
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Microbiome are tiny bacteria and organisms in the human gut, which help digest food and strengthen immunity.

53
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
If you buy into an idea, you completely believe in it.

54
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Nettles are common nutritious edible plants with leaves covered in hairs that sting when touched.

55
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
A superfood describes a food containing many vitamins and other healthy nutrients.

56
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And finally, the adjective flat means lacking energy, emotion or excitement.

57
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
And probably means you should go outside and get foraging.

58
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Once again, our six minutes are up. Goodbye for now.
