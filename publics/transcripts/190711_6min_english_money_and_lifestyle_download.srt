4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,720
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,759
And I'm Rob.

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,359
In this program, we're talking about finance and in particular,

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,000
planning for our future lifestyles.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,280
I can barely afford my current lifestyle and I'll same here.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,160
But perhaps we'll pick up some good tips today.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,160
Before that, though, a question.

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,840
Being a millionaire may be an impossible dream for most of us,

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,960
but when was the word first used in English?

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,600
Was it A, the 1600s?

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,640
B, the 1700s or C, the 1800s?

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,000
What do you think, Rob?

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,359
I'm going to guess that it's the 1600s

17
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,240
as there have always been very wealthy people.

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,799
Well, I'll reveal the answer later.

19
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,359
Now, the BBC Money Box programme covers all sorts of financial features.

20
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,200
Recently, they were talking about lifestyle financial planning,

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,519
which is planning your finances to meet the kind of lifestyle you want to have.

22
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,120
Julie Lorde leads a financial planning organisation,

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,560
and she talked about the process of lifestyle financial planning.

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,359
How many numbers does she say you need to start with?

25
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,319
Well, we were start by saying that we need to put together a lifetime cash flow forecast

26
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,120
or a model.

27
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,319
You just need four numbers.

28
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:24,560
Your income, your expenditure, assets, liabilities.

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,719
And then we can project forward to show you what sort of lifestyle you will have

30
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:30,480
if you do nothing at all.

31
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,000
And if indeed you do some of the things that perhaps an iser or a pension

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,719
or any other kind of financial product might help you with.

33
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,840
So how many numbers do you need?

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,960
She says that you start with just four numbers.

35
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,760
That's right.

36
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,000
The first of these numbers is your income.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,920
This is the money that you have coming in.

38
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,680
Your salary, for example.

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,320
Then there's the number for your expenditure.

40
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,159
This is the money you have going out.

41
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,159
For rent, food, entertainment, transport and so on.

42
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,560
The next number was for assets.

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,359
This is the cash value of things that you own.

44
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,000
For example, property, cars, jewelry,

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,840
as well as savings and investments.

46
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,800
That kind of thing.

47
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,360
And finally, there is liabilities.

48
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,599
This is the money that you owe, for example, on credit cards or loans.

49
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,280
So if you know these details, she says they can come up with a lifetime cash flow forecast.

50
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,439
Which is a calculation of how much money you can expect to have in the future.

51
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,240
And if that is enough to meet your expectations,

52
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,039
do you have those details? Do you know your numbers, Rob?

53
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,599
I have a very detailed spreadsheet

54
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,560
where I do list my income and expenditure.

55
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,039
So I do know for a month to month how much money I need and how much I can spend.

56
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,879
Oh, that sounds very organized.

57
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,719
What does it tell you about your future?

58
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:49,039
Well, it just reminds me of exactly how much money I don't have.

59
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,039
It's quite depressing. How about you, Neil?

60
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,039
Oh, I live in blissful ignorance.

61
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,759
I have no idea how big my debts are.

62
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,199
I try not to worry about it.

63
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,719
I kind of think I'm much too young to worry about it now.

64
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,079
And that as if by magic, it will all work out in the end.

65
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:07,439
So it would be difficult for me to come up with those four numbers.

66
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,919
Anyway, let's listen to Julie Lorde again,

67
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,120
describing the lifestyle financial planning process.

68
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:18,079
Well, we were start by saying that we need to put together a lifetime cash flow forecast

69
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,000
or a model. You just need four numbers.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,320
Your income, your expenditure, assets, liabilities.

71
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,480
And then we can project forward to show you what sort of lifestyle you will have

72
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,160
if you do nothing at all.

73
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,680
And if indeed you do some of the things that perhaps an isor or a pension

74
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,480
or any other kind of financial product might help you with.

75
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,360
Is lifestyle financial planning only for older people with a good pension?

76
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,800
Not according to Julie Lorde?

77
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,600
Well, it's not all about old age, is it?

78
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,880
I mean, there are people we have quite a number of younger clients who come to us

79
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,960
and say we just want to get financially organised.

80
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,919
We've heard about all this stuff, these financial products.

81
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:55,519
No idea really what they are or more importantly what they're going to do for us.

82
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,000
So can you give us a hand to help us look forward to see what will happen?

83
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,039
So she also has younger clients who ask for her company's help.

84
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,519
Yes, she uses the phrase give us a hand, which means to help someone.

85
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,159
If you give someone a hand, you help them.

86
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,199
Exactly. In the way that I give you a hand with six minute English.

87
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:19,120
Well, I think I give you a hand rather than the other way around Neil.

88
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,159
Really? Well, let's not fall out about it.

89
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:23,680
Let's listen to Julie Lorde again.

90
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,319
Well, it's not all about old age, is it?

91
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,599
I mean, there are people we have quite a number of younger clients who come to us

92
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:31,759
and say we just want to get financially organised.

93
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,639
We've heard about all this stuff, these financial products.

94
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,240
No idea really what they are or more importantly what they're going to do for us.

95
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,719
So can you give us a hand to help us look forward to see what will happen?

96
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,280
It's nearly time now to review our vocabulary, but first let's have the answer to our quiz question.

97
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,880
When was the word millionaire first used in English?

98
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,640
Was it A, the 1600s, B, the 1700s or C, the 1800s?

99
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,080
What did you think, Rob?

100
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,960
Well, I guessed and said it was the 1600s.

101
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,360
Well, not a good guess this time. I'm afraid it's actually a lot later.

102
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,880
It was the 1800s when it was first used in English,

103
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,759
though it had appeared in French in the 1700s.

104
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,199
Now onto the vocabulary.

105
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,040
Yes, we had a lot of financial terms in this programme.

106
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,439
We had cash flow forecast.

107
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,959
This is a calculation of how much money you can expect to have

108
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,959
at a particular time in the future.

109
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,240
And the cash flow forecast is based on knowing your income,

110
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,439
which is the money you have coming in and your expenditure,

111
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,120
the money you have going out.

112
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,759
You also need to know your assets,

113
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,920
which is the value of things you own as well as savings and investments.

114
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,560
This is balanced against your liabilities,

115
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,240
which is the term for the money that you owe, for example, on credit cards.

116
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,439
And finally, we have the expression to give someone a hand,

117
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:52,560
meaning to help someone.

118
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,279
Well, that's all from us in this programme.

119
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,360
We look forward to your company next time.

120
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,800
Until then, you can find us in all the usual places on social media,

121
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,480
online and on our app.

122
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,560
Just search for BBC Learning English.

123
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,199
Bye.

124
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,639
And thanks, Rob, for giving me a hand.

125
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,360
No, thank you for giving me a hand.

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,399
Bye.
