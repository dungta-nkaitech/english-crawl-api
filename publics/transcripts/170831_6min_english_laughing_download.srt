00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,480
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English,

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,559
where we bring you an entertaining topic

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,199
and six related items of vocabulary.

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm Neil.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,480
LAUGHTER

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,800
And those...

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
Gaffors you can hear...

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,679
LAUGHTER

13
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,679
...are coming from Tim.

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,679
So, what's so funny, Tim?

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,880
LAUGHTER

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,159
Can you...

17
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,679
Can you pass me the last of four to...

18
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:37,039
Yes, OK, here you go.

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,880
Well, it was just something our producer said

20
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,560
before I came into the studio.

21
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,000
A Gaffor, by the way, is a loud laugh

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,679
that you can't control.

23
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:50,239
LAUGHTER

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,200
So, while Tim laughed his head off,

25
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,039
and that means to laugh very loudly

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,679
for a long time, I'll introduce the show.

27
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,240
Today, Tim, we're talking about laughter

28
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,759
and how it could kill you.

29
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:02,719
LAUGHTER

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,719
Oh, come on, Neil.

31
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:06,560
That's not funny.

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,760
Laughing is good for you.

33
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,879
Everyone knows that.

34
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,280
Well, not when you laugh like that, Tim.

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,359
You're bright red in the face.

36
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:16,239
You've got tears streaming down your face

37
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,159
and you nearly choked on a glass of water.

38
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,640
Choke means to stop breathing

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,280
because something's blocking your throat, by the way.

40
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,359
Now, without laughing or choking,

41
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,679
can you please tell me how many times a day

42
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:29,840
the average adult laughs?

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,519
Is it A, 17, B, 70, or C, 700?

44
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,039
Mmm.

45
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:40,079
Or surely it depends on what type of person you are.

46
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,439
Mmm, maybe it does.

47
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,640
That's why I'm asking about the average number of times, Tim.

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,239
So, just make an intelligent guess.

49
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,120
OK.

50
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,640
Well, I laugh a lot,

51
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,000
so I'm going to say 70 times a day.

52
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,680
700 seems like you'd be laughing all the time.

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,840
But you've worried me, Neil.

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,840
I know we sometimes say I nearly died laughing,

55
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,359
but nobody does actually die laughing, do they?

56
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,520
Well, I think the risk of dying of laughter is probably low,

57
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,759
but in theory, what happens when we laugh is potentially dangerous?

58
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,319
Let's listen to cognitive neuroscientists

59
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,840
Sophie Scott talking about what happens when we laugh.

60
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,640
Laughter, in a competition for control of your ribcage

61
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,840
in your brain between laughter and breathing and speaking,

62
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
laughter will always win.

63
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,840
And laughter just takes those same muscles

64
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,840
and it squeezes them out, out, out, out, out, out.

65
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
It goes out, out, out, out.

66
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,840
And notably, it does not want to let you breathe in.

67
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
It's trying to kill you.

68
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,840
It's quite, it's quite dangerous.

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,840
So, when you laugh a lot, your diaphragm,

70
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,840
that's the sheet of muscle below your lungs,

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,840
contracts and squeezes the air out of your lungs.

72
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,840
This makes it hard to breathe,

73
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,840
which is why you were gasping for breath earlier, Tim,

74
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,840
and that's why laughter can kill you.

75
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,840
Gasping means having difficulty breathing.

76
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,840
Well, I've caught my breath now, I didn't die,

77
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,840
and I think it's fair to say, Neil, that laughter is good for you.

78
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,840
And when you laugh, your body releases happy hormones,

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,840
and according to some research,

80
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,840
people feel less pain as a result of having a good laugh.

81
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,840
So, scientists are saying laughter is a sort of natural pain killer?

82
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,840
Apparently, yes.

83
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,840
They've done research where they make people laugh

84
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
and then test their pain levels afterwards.

85
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,840
And they found that if people only chuckle a bit,

86
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,840
it doesn't act as a pain killer,

87
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,840
but if you laugh a lot, it does.

88
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,840
So, a chuckle sounds like this.

89
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,840
Chuckling means to laugh quietly,

90
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,840
so you need belly laughter then.

91
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,840
Great big gaffer.

92
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
That's right.

93
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,840
Gaffer is pretty much the opposite of a chuckle.

94
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,840
I was gafforing earlier in the show,

95
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,840
and would you like to demonstrate your own gaffer, Neil?

96
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,840
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

97
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
Fantastic.

98
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,840
Can I try pinching you now,

99
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
and test whether you feel any pain?

100
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
No, you can't, Tim.

101
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
It's time for the answer to today's quiz question.

102
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,840
I asked you, how many times a day does the average adult laugh?

103
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,840
Is it a 17, b 70 or c 700?

104
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,840
I said 70.

105
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
Ah, sorry. The right answer is actually 17,

106
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
less than you thought I'm afraid, Tim.

107
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,840
But children laugh on average 300 times a day.

108
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,840
Ooh, that's a big difference.

109
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,840
You see, Neil, we all need to laugh more,

110
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:43,839
and you shouldn't be trying to tell us that laughing is dangerous.

111
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,839
Maybe you're right.

112
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:47,839
So let's move on and go over the words we learned today.

113
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,839
The first one is gaffor, which is a loud laugh that you can't control.

114
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:54,839
Neil surprised us with his deep gaffor.

115
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:57,839
Next up, number two, to laugh your head off,

116
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,839
means to laugh very loudly for a long time.

117
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:03,839
It's a really funny movie. You laugh your head off.

118
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:06,839
Okay, number three, choke, means to stop breathing

119
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,839
because something is blocking your throat.

120
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:11,839
I nearly choked to death on a cheese sandwich.

121
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:14,839
Well, poor Tim, you should eat more slowly.

122
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,839
Diafram is our next word,

123
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:20,839
and that's the sheet of muscle separating your lungs from your stomach.

124
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:24,839
We use our diaphragm for breathing, talking and laughing.

125
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:28,839
Do opera singers have more powerful diaphragms than other people?

126
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:30,839
I don't know the answer to that, Tim.

127
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:33,839
So number five, which is gasping,

128
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,839
which means having difficulty breathing.

129
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,839
He was gasping for breath as he swam to the surface of the swimming pool.

130
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,839
But gas also means to be shocked or surprised by something.

131
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,839
For example, I gasped in astonishment when I heard Neil laugh.

132
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:51,839
Our final word is chuckle, which means to laugh quietly.

133
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,839
The audience chuckled through the show, but they didn't seem very amused.

134
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,839
Oh dear.

135
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,839
Well, I hope our audience has been amused today.

136
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:02,839
If you're looking for more laughs, then please check out our Facebook,

137

Twitter, Instagram and YouTube pages.

138
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,839
You may find something to make you chuckle or guffaw there.

139
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:09,839
Bye.

140
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,839
Goodbye.

141
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:13,839
Six minutes in bush from the BBC.
