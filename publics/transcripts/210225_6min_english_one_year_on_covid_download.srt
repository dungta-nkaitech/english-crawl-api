Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Neil.

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,039
And I'm Georgina.

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,160
In this program, we're talking about something the whole world knows about coronavirus.

5
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,519
Sadly, COVID-19 has been responsible for more than 2 million deaths globally.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,799
What's believed to have started in the city of Wuhan in China went on to become a pandemic,

7
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,520
a disease that affects many people around the world.

8
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,439
Unsurprisingly, we've discussed this a lot on 6 Minute English, but over a year on,

9
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:49,039
since the first outbreak, it's good to take stock or look back over the situation and see what

10
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,560
we have learnt. And find out how our knowledge has changed.

11
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,320
Before we do that, Georgina, let's test your knowledge with a question.

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:03,600
In 1918, stroke 1919, another major virus known as Spanish flu swept across the world.

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,120
Do you know approximately how many people were infected by it?

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,159
Was it A, 5 million, B, 50 million or C, 500 million?

15
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,799
Well, I know it was bad, so I'm going for the awful number of 500 million.

16
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,840
Okay, I'll reveal the right answer later on.

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,960
Now, back to the current coronavirus pandemic.

18
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:29,280
It was only at the end of December 2019 when reports of a new flu-like infection first came out

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,359
China. Within weeks, millions of people were in lockdown as the virus took hold around the world.

20
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:41,839
Took hold means it became stronger and was difficult to stop. We all had to change the way we lived

21
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:48,239
to stop it spreading. But while we played our part by washing our hands, wearing masks and staying

22
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,199
at home, some people were busy working for a solution to fight this deadly virus.

23
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:58,719
You're talking about the scientist, Georgina. Their response was immediate and it's something

24
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,799
the BBC World Service Programme Science and Action has been reflecting on.

25
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,319
At the beginning of the outbreak, Jenny Rohn, a virologist from University College London,

26
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,719
spoke to the programme about her concerns if the virus turned out to be like flu.

27
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,240
Here's what she said.

28
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,719
Seasonal flu is a huge killer and if you've probably seen the numbers, it makes the Wuhan virus so

29
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:25,360
that it's a bit wimpy. That's simply because of the sheer number of people that flu infects every year.

30
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,800
And if the Wuhan virus started spreading like that and going all over the world, you would see

31
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
a lot of people dead. This is why people are worried.

32
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,719
So we know flu is a virus that can spread easily and can affect many, many people.

33
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:43,680
This is why at the time, comparing it with the new coronavirus, made COVID look wimpy.

34
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,520
That's a word to describe something or someone that's feeble, not very strong.

35
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:54,159
Yes, Jenny called the great or significant number of people affected by flu as sheer numbers.

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,000
The fear at the time was if coronavirus spread like flu, it would kill many people.

37
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,800
Well, we all know what happened next. It did spread, but working behind the scenes,

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,480
scientists developed tests we could use to see if we were infected.

39
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,200
But the main challenge was to develop a vaccine that could stop us becoming infected

40
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,719
altogether. This involved people around the world working together to share information.

41
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,079
This work started straight away. And Dr Peter Dasack,

42
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:27,759
zoologist and president of Eco Health Alliance, told the Science in Action program that this

43
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,359
initial response in China helped with the development of a vaccine.

44
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:38,799
Despite whatever on says, you know, they had a system to find unusual pneumonia cases.

45
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,160
We now think that that system kicked in. Maybe not on the first actual case of COVID,

46
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,400
but certainly within a couple of months of the first case, it seems.

47
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,160
So that's quite quick. And then from that point, to actually getting a full genome genetic sequence

48
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,800
of the virus was very quick and getting that published and publicly available.

49
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,000
And then rapidly developing diagnostic tests and vaccines now. That's really worked well.

50
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,319
So China had a scientific system which kicked in or started happening quite quickly.

51
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,000
Within a few months of the first coronavirus outbreak, experts began to work out the full genome

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,680
of the virus. That's the full amount of genetic information of something.

53
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,839
This genetic information was made publicly available and helped towards the development of various

54
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,240
vaccines that we see now, which is hopefully our way out of this pandemic.

55
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,920
Let's hope so, Georgina. The science is amazing and has explained in more detail in the BBC's

56
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,800
Science in Action program. But now let's get back to our quiz question. Earlier I asked you

57
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,160
how many people were infected by Spanish flu back in 1918-1919?

58
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,040
I guessed 500 million. Was I right?

59
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,480
You were Georgina. An incredible 500 million people around the world were infected by the

60
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,879
Spanish flu virus and over 50 million people died worldwide.

61
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:04,959
Well, the death toll from coronavirus hasn't been that bad, but is still a significant number.

62
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,279
Okay, well, we've just time to recap some of the vocabulary we've discussed today,

63
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,680
starting with pandemic, a disease that affects many people around the world.

64
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,480
When something took hold, it means it became stronger and was difficult to stop.

65
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,040
The word wimpy describes something or someone that's feeble or not very strong.

66
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,719
Something that is sheer is great or significant. So sheer numbers means a great amount

67
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,800
of something. When something kicks in, it starts to happen.

68
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,120
And a genome is a full amount of genetic information of something.

69
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,280
Well, we're out of time, but there's lots more six minute English programs to enjoy on our
