00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,679
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Sophie.

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,760
And I'm Neil. So, Sophie, I watched Snow White and the Huntsman on TV last night.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,600
Oh, you mean the modern retelling of the story Snow White?

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,199
Did you enjoy it, Neil?

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,320
Uh, it was okay, but the seven dwarves were no fun.

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,920
I prefer the original Disney cartoon version.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,600
Don't be silly, Neil. What Disney didn't invent the story?

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,840
The movie you watched is a remake, a film that has been made again.

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,239
But the fairy tale is very old.

14
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,879
Well, that may be true, but I still prefer the Disney version with funny dwarves.

15
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,039
In the new version, even the names of the dwarves are different and, you know,

16
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,159
serious looking.

17
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,719
But this new version is for young adults.

18
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,920
It's a different genre or style of film.

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,120
Names like Sneezie, Dopey, Happy and Grumpy are two childish.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,519
Hmm, what's wrong with childish?

21
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:09,519
Oh, it's right up your street, isn't it, Neil?

22
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,879
It's too right.

23
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:14,480
Anyway, fairy tales are the subject of today's show,

24
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,960
and I have a question for you.

25
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,759
Which movie star played the role of the evil fairy in Maleficent?

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,880
A 2014 film based on the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty.

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,520
Was it A, Kate Blanchett, B, Angelina Jolie, or C, Mell Striep?

28
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,520
Well, I'll go for A, Kate Blanchett.

29
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,520
She often plays evil characters.

30
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,040
I can't forget her in the 2008 movie, Indiana Jones,

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,880
in the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,600
Ha, well, we'll find out if you chose the right movie star later on in the program.

33
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,919
But, to return to the idea of childish fairy stories,

34
00:01:51,919 --> 00:01:55,519
let's listen to Diane Perkis, a children's author.

35
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,799
Talking about how originally, fairy tales were intended for an adult audience.

36
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,599
Interestingly, there has been a bit of a move towards seeing fairy tales as an adult,

37
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,519
or at any rate, a young adult, a dark sort of genre.

38
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:13,840
And that's natural because actually in the past,

39
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,599
fairy tales were told by adults to adults and William Shakespeare's time.

40
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,360
It's only in the Victorian era that they become moral children's tales,

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,960
and it looks like we're going back to the inception of fairy stories now with a more adult take on them.

42
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,800
Diane Perkis, so these Hollywood remakes aimed at the teen market, are actually returning fairy tales

43
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,680
to an adult audience. That's right, Neil. And dark here means scary or frightening.

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,280
The Victorians toned down this dark content, or made it less forceful.

45
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,200
They also introduced a moral or message about what's right and wrong to the tales.

46
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,560
And inception means the beginning. So, fairy tales began as a dark genre.

47
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,879
Can you give us some examples of dark stories written by the Brothers Grim, Neil?

48
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:09,200
Well, I have a list here. Let's see, in the frog prints, the print says,

49
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:14,399
doesn't kiss the frog. She throws it. She throws it against the wall.

50
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,119
Yes. I prefer the kiss version.

51
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:24,959
And in Little Red Riding Hood, don't believe that version where the wolf

52
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,639
shuts granny in a cupboard in the real version. She gobbles her up and then eats red riding hood for

53
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:36,159
dessert. Charming. And to gobble something up means to eat it very fast.

54
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,159
Oh, okay, that's enough. Let's move on. Did you know that some of the stories,

55
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,719
like Beauty in the Beast, Red Riding Hood, Cinderella and Snow White,

56
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:52,240
go back much further than the earliest written stories? Even the ones in Latin and Greek?

57
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,039
No, I didn't. And to be honest, Sophie, I thought, I thought, well, Disney had written them.

58
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:05,120
Oh, Neil. Well, research suggests that some fairy tales date back to well before the Brothers Grim,

59
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:12,480
and even Shakespeare. Let's hear more from Dr. Jamie Tarani, anthropologist at Durham University

60
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:21,840
in the UK. So these fairy tales we've looked at, we've been able to trace back really thousands

61
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:28,160
of years, probably sort of four to six thousand years is the origin of many famous European

62
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,040
folk tales stories such as Beauty in the Beast. At six thousand years.

63
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,240
Yep, going right back to the Bronze Age. We've been able to trace the transmission across

64
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,440
generations of these stories much further back than is generally recognised.

65
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,680
But Sophie, if there's no written evidence of the stories from six thousand years ago,

66
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,480
how does Dr. Tarani, who we've just heard from, know people, we're telling them?

67
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:00,319
Well, dating languages isn't something I'm familiar with. I think it's a bit like looking at

68
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:06,720
a few dinosaur bones and trying to reconstruct what dinosaurs looked like. But here, you're trying

69
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,520
to reconstruct stories without any actual bits. It must have been hard work for the researchers.

70
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,680
Indeed. Well, I think it's time to hear the quiz question again, Sophie.

71
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,520
Okay, I asked which movie star played the role of the evil fairy in Maleficent,

72
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:30,479
a film based on the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty? Was it A, Kate Blanchett, B, Angelina Jolie,

73
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:38,639
or C, Mel Streep? I said Kate Blanchett. And you were wrong. Angelina Jolie played the main character

74
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,639
in the film Maleficent. Kate Blanchett played the Elf Queen Galadriel in Lord of the Rings,

75
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,560
and Mel Streep played a blue-haired witch in the 2014 film Into the Woods.

76
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:59,759
Now, can we hear those words again? Okay, remake, genre, dark, toned down, moral,

77
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,079
inception, gobble up. Well, that's the end of today's Spellbinding

00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,759
