6 Nuit English from the BBC

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,880
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,879
And I'm Beth. Switch on the TV or read a newspaper and it's full of bad news about the environment.

4
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,879
But climate change is damaging more than just the planet's health.

5
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:24,080
It's affecting human health too.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,640
A growing number of people around the world are experiencing something

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,640
and psychiatrists are calling eco-anxiety.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:39,799
Eco-anxiety involves feeling grief, guilt, fear or hopelessness about the future of the planet due to climate change.

9
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:43,480
Of course, direct victims of climate change suffer most.

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:51,200
Flood survivors experience depression and anxiety, and people breathing polluted air are at a higher risk of dementia.

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:57,200
But according to the Institute of Psychiatrists, just reading about the state of the planet in the news

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,760
is causing stress and anxiety.

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,799
In this programme on eco-anxiety, we'll be learning some useful vocabulary related to this worrying topic,

14
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,400
and hopefully be hearing some happier environmental news as well.

15
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,719
I hope so, Neil. With so much bad news, it's sometimes hard to feel optimistic about the future.

16
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:19,520
Well, here's a question about some good climate news for a change.

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,000
In Australia, an animal thought to be extinct has been spotted for the first time in over 50 years,

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,719
but what is the animal? Is it A, a shark, B, a lizard or C, a parrot?

19
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,040
I'll guess it's a shark.

20
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,159
OK, Beth, I'll reveal the answer later.

21
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,359
Unsurprisingly, many of those suffering from eco-anxiety are young people.

22
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:49,840
When BBC Radio 4 programme Woman's Hour spoke with veteran environmentalist Judy Ling-Wong,

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,000
they asked her if she was worried for young people today.

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,640
Why would she have the tremendous compassion for them?

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,400
Because what a mess we have left the world in, our generation and the generation before.

26
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,760
Of course, the science is so advanced now.

27
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,599
Very much in the past, the science was saying, yes, we think perhaps we perhaps have this modern zone.

28
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,479
Now we have the exact science, so it is an absolutely different ballgame.

29
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,400
We actually know what to do now.

30
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,520
It is about getting on with it, and the young people are the furthest ahead in this.

31
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,880
They can see the future as theirs, and they are impassioned to do something about it.

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,240
Judy feels compassion, a strong feeling of sympathy for young people,

33
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,240
and the wish for them not to suffer.

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,840
She blames older generations and uses the phrase,

35
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,160
what a mess to emphasise that the planet is in bad shape.

36
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,439
You can use the phrase, what a something to intensify the thing you're talking about.

37
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,160
For example, if someone gives you a birthday present,

38
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,079
you might say, what a nice surprise.

39
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,799
But Judy is optimistic.

40
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:00,800
The science on climate change is much more accurate than it used to be.

41
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,280
For example, we know that moving away from fossil fuels would be a big help.

42
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,919
Science has changed the ballgame.

43
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,439
The set of circumstances that controls how a situation occurs.

44
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,800
Knowing exactly how to stop climate change has impassioned young people.

45
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,599
They feel strongly motivated to take action.

46
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,000
And as it turns out, taking action may be one of the most powerful antidotes to eco-anxiety.

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,639
Actually doing something to combat climate change reduces feelings of helplessness.

48
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,079
Here's Judy Ling-Wong again, speaking with BBC Radio 4's Women's Hour.

49
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,240
You know, when the Institute of Psychiatry published a special issue on climate anxiety,

50
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,479
one of the papers pointed out is that if you can do something about it,

51
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,399
if you feel part of the movement to change things or to stabilise things,

52
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:51,759
they feel much better.

53
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:58,639
And also, you know, at the moment, the government is trying to reach net zero by 2050 and all that.

54
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,199
And they're committed to creating two million new green jobs.

55
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:07,359
Now, if young people and activists think about this,

56
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:12,399
if you have a green job, you're actually dedicating your entire working life

57
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:14,639
to building a green sustainable future.

58
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,079
And there's a huge effect on your psychology.

59
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,839
Judy urges young people to join a movement, a group of people who share the same beliefs and ideas.

60
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:31,120
Being part of the solution, not the problem, helps reduce anxiety.

61
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,719
And with new green jobs, young people can protect the environment their entire working life.

62
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:40,399
The period of life spent in employment between leaving school and retirement.

63
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:43,759
And Judy's hopefulness is shared.

64
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,879
Recent polls showed that the majority of people are worried about climate change and are prepared

65
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:54,560
to make changes. Finally, some good news. And speaking of good news, what was the answer to your

66
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,719
question, Neil? I asked which extinct animal has recently been spotted in Australia.

67
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:05,919
You guessed it was a shark, which was the wrong answer. Actually, it was a lizard,

68
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:12,720
the Eerless Grassland Dragon, a native to East Australia that was last seen in the wild in 1969.

69
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,800
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this program on eco-anxiety,

70
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,040
starting with compassion, a strong feeling of sympathy and the wish for people not to suffer.

71
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,879
The phrase, what a something is used to intensify the thing you're talking about.

72
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,960
For example, what a mess or what a nice surprise.

73
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:41,199
The ball game refers to the set of circumstances that controls how a situation happens.

74
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,120
If you're impassioned, you're emotionally motivated to do something.

75
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,759
A movement is a group of people with the same beliefs, ideas and aims.

76
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,359
And finally, your working life is the period of life spent in employment between leaving school

77
00:05:55,359 --> 00:06:01,439
and retirement. Once again, our six minutes are up. Join us again next time here on six minute

78
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:03,439
English. Goodbye for now. Bye.
