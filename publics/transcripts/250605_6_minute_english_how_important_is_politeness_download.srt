00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:12,359
Hello, this is 6-Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:18,240
And I'm Beth. In this programme, we're talking about politeness. Britain has a reputation

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,920
for being a polite place where children are told to say please and thank you. But in real

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,879
life, that isn't always true. You give me that pen.

6
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:30,119
I'm sorry, that was a bit rude.

7
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,480
Well, what should I have said?

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,920
How about Neil, please could you pass me the pen?

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,799
Fine, Neil, could you please pass me the pen?

10
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:39,320
There you go, that's much better.

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,719
Now, listen as BBC Radio 4 presenter, Michael Rosen, who is a well-known poet and children's

12
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,000
author in Britain, describes what happened to him one day.

13
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:53,399
Recently, this is how it went. A boy was walking past me in the street,

14
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:00,039
stomped and said, hey, you're a thingy in it. Now, that one seems to break all the rules.

15
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:03,960
And because he broke the rules, he gave me a problem. How do I answer it?

16
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:10,920
A boy saw Michael Rosen and said, hey, you're thingy in it. He is the word thingy,

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,280
because although he recognised Michael, he couldn't remember his name. He also said,

18
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,680
in it, which is short, for, isn't it, to emphasise what he'd said.

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,520
So, was the boy being in polite, or was he just happy meeting a famous person in the street?

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,240
And why do we teach kids to be polite in the first place? That's what we'll be discussing in this

21
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,680
programme using some useful new vocabulary. But first, I have a question for you, Neil.

22
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,280
The British are well-known for being polite, as we've said, and there's even an idiom we use

23
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,760
in certain situations to remind someone to be especially polite. But what is it?

24
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:56,439
Is it A, mind your A's and B's, B, mind your P's and Q's, or C, mind your X's and Y's?

25
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,680
Well, I know the answer to this, but I'm going to say C, mind your X's and Y's, because I think it's

26
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:09,960
brilliant. Okay, interesting. Well, we'll find out the correct answer later in the programme.

27
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:16,599
So, let's return to the boy who said, hey, you're thingy in it, to famous poet Michael Rosen.

28
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,759
Was that in polite or not? Professor Louise Millaney, who studies the language of polite-ness,

29
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:28,840
has an answer. She thinks that polite-ness is as much to do with the person being spoken to as

30
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,280
the person speaking, as she explained to BBC Radio 4 programme, Word of Mouth.

31
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,479
I think the crucial thing there is in how you've perceived it. So, obviously he's not given us

32
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:45,560
the conventional, a good afternoon, Mr Rosen, or a more formal approach. It's very, very informal,

33
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,599
and he can't remember your name, and he's saying in it. Now, that has been interpreted by you

34
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:55,719
as non-threatening to you. You don't see him as insulting you, and you're actually quite

35
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:00,120
kindly disposed to that person. So, you haven't interpreted it as offensive or aggressive.

36
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,159
You said, I think you described it as being quite civil, actually.

37
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:08,520
Michael Rosen didn't feel that the boy was insulting him. To insult someone means to be rude or

38
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:14,199
offensive to them. Although his speech was very informal, Michael thought the boy was actually

39
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:20,519
pleased to see him, not rude at all. Michael was well disposed to the boy. He liked and approved

40
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:26,519
of him. So, you could say that polite-ness is subjective. If Michael doesn't feel offended,

41
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,879
then where is the offence? Then why do we teach children to be polite at all? Well, according to

42
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:37,879
Professor Malaney, it's to do with the rules of society. That's right. Louise thinks that by

43
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:43,959
teaching our kids polite-ness, they enjoy the benefits of being accepted in society. So,

44
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:50,280
imagine how embarrassed she felt when her two-year-old daughter repeatedly ignored the cook at her

45
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:57,960
nursery school and refused to say hello. Here's Louise Malaney telling the story to BBC Radio 4's

46
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:03,240
Word of Mouth. The cook looks so disappointed. And as I mentioned in the book, it felt to me like

47
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,600
there were lots of other children skipping and jumping past going, hello, being really friendly

48
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:14,280
children. And my daughter was just there and we started to make excuses for her like, oh, she's tired,

49
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,920
oh, she's teething, she's this and she's that. Because the embarrassment was so strong and I felt

50
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,800
awful walking back past the kitchen on my way out. I was almost trying to hide my face going, I'm

51
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,000
the one with the really rude child. When her daughter didn't say hello to an adult, Louise made

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,319
excuses for her. If you make excuses for someone, you try to explain the reasons for their behavior.

53
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:41,079
For example, Louise said her daughter was tired, she was growing new teeth, she was this and that.

54
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:46,680
The idiom this and that can be used to describe various unspecified things. For example, if someone

55
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,879
asks what you did this afternoon, you might reply, oh, not much. I stayed at home, I watched TV,

56
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:57,639
I did this and that. Politeness means different things to different people, but we still like it when

57
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:03,719
people are polite to us. And I think the polite thing to do now is reveal the answer to my question

58
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:11,960
Neil. So the idiom that we use to remind someone to be polite is not mind your exes and wise,

59
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,920
I'm sorry Neil, it's mind your peas and cues. That's a shame, exes and wise is much better.

60
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:24,360
Okay, now let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt starting with Thingy, an informal word that's

61
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:31,320
used if you can't remember someone's or something's name. People also use the slang words, what's

62
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:37,639
his name or what's a name for the same reason. In it is a short form of the tag question, isn't it?

63
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:43,879
It's used to add emphasis to a statement. The adjective insulting means rude or offensive.

64
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:49,959
If you are well disposed to someone, you like and approve of them. When you make excuses for someone,

65
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:55,719
you explain the reasons for their bad behaviour. And finally, the idiom this and that describes

66
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,320
various unspecified things. Once again, our six minutes are up, but why not test yourself with
