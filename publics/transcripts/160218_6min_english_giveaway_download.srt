00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,720
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,919
And I'm Sophie.

7
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:19,679
Sophie, I can't get out of my head what Mark Zuckerberg,

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,480
you know the guy who created Facebook said recently.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,920
Oh, I know!

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,560
He pledged or made a serious promise

11
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:30,079
to give away 99% of his shares in Facebook

12
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:32,000
over the course of his lifetime.

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,920
The shares are currently worth around $45 billion.

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,519
Why, oh why?

15
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:41,679
Did he decide to give his fortune away?

16
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,119
It's puzzling me.

17
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:44,960
It's an act of philanthropy,

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,799
which means helping others,

19
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,320
especially by giving large amounts of money to good causes.

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,359
And philanthropy is the subject of this show.

21
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:55,359
But don't worry about Zuckerberg.

22
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,280
It's probably fair to say he will remain extremely well off

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,320
or wealthy,

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,479
even after giving away his fortune.

25
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,600
Well, that's true.

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,159
Let me ask you then today's quiz question.

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,959
Who was the most generous philanthropist in the US last year?

28
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,879
Was it A, Bill Gates, B, Mark Zuckerberg,

29
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:16,719
or C, Warren Buffett?

30
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,519
Errr, I'm going to say C, Warren Buffett.

31
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,200
Well, we'll find out if you were right or not later on in the show.

32
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,799
Now, Zuckerberg was inspired to give away his fortune

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,040
by the birth of his daughter Max.

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,760
In a letter to Max posted on Facebook,

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,640
in his post he talks about using the money

36
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,719
to advance human potential

37
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,560
and promote equality for all children in the next generation.

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,159
Equality, in other words,

39
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,560
with the same rights and opportunities.

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,079
Zuckerberg is the latest in a long line of billionaire

41
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,640
entrepreneurs to turn philanthropist

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,800
and use his money for good causes.

43
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,359
Did you know that some of the earliest American philanthropists

44
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:01,439
were robber barons?

45
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,719
Robber barons?

46
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,760
What's, hang on, what are robber barons?

47
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,480
They're business people who use unethical

48
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,719
or morally wrong business tactics

49
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,120
to gain large personal fortunes.

50
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,560
19th century entrepreneurs like Rockefeller, Carnegie,

51
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,039
and Ford were robber barons.

52
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,400
They built up huge empires in industry,

53
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,920
oil, steel, railways and cars.

54
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,480
And were largely responsible for transforming the United States

55
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,080
from an agricultural nation into an industrial one.

56
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,240
Henry Ford, he's the one who said you can have any color you want

57
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,439
as long as it's black.

58
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,040
I like that kind of thing.

59
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,240
Focus Neal.

60
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,840
Okay, okay.

61
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,080
But as the barons got older,

62
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,200
they decided they wanted to give back to society

63
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,280
and turned to philanthropy.

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,039
Andrew Carnegie believes that wealth should be spent

65
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,199
to make the world a better place.

66
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,560
Hmm, that sounds too warm and fuzzy

67
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,520
for a ruthless or cruel robber baron.

68
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,879
People changed Neal.

69
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,800
When he died,

70
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,199
Carnegie had given away a total of $350 million

71
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,840
to the state to spend on public works.

72
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,759
That's around $8 billion in today's money.

73
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,520
Well, let's listen to Hugh Cunningham,

74
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,040
a professor of history at the University of Kent here in the UK.

75
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,600
He talks about what the average Joe,

76
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,120
that's you and me folks,

77
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,080
thinks about big business and philanthropy today.

78
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,160
The very word for philanthropy does not necessarily have

79
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,360
100% positive connotations for the public at large,

80
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,320
given where we are in terms of the public's attitude towards

81
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,800
big business or the banks and all that kind of stuff.

82
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,560
So I think it's in everyone's interest to try and broaden out the concepts

83
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,879
of philanthropy into a wide emotion of giving

84
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,800
making a contribution, making a difference.

85
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,520
Yes, banks and big businesses can easily afford to give away

86
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,800
millions of dollars for the public good if they choose to.

87
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,879
But it's not so easy when you're an individual struggling to pay the rent.

88
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,080
That's right Neal,

89
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,280
but a lot of people in the UK are super rich compared to those in the developing world.

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,599
And we can make a big difference by donating or giving

91
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,879
smaller amounts of money to help improve their lives.

92
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,159
And that's what professor Cunningham means when he says we should

93
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:26,159
broaden out the notion or idea of philanthropy.

94
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:30,000
It's not only Robert Barons who can afford to be philanthropic.

95
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,079
Let's listen to Toby Ord, a graduate student from Oxford University

96
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,319
talking about how he makes a difference.

97
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,920
I worked out that over my life I'd be able to earn about

98
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,519
one and a half million pounds and that I could maintain my current standard

99
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,680
of living as a graduate student and still donate about a million pounds of that.

100
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:56,560
So Toby actually gives away any money that he earns above 18,000 pounds a year.

101
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,919
He feels that he doesn't need more than this amount to maintain his standard of living.

102
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,799
I'm impressed by Toby's pledge, but I don't think I could live like a student my whole life.

103
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:09,599
I thought that would suit you extremely well Neal.

104
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,000
Now, why don't you give us the answer to today's quiz question?

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,800
I asked who was the most generous philanthropist in the US last year.

106
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,600
Was it A. Bill Gates, B. Mark Zuckerberg or C. Warren Buffett?

107
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,439
I said Warren Buffett.

108
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,680
Ah, good guess Sophie. Well done.

109
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:37,279
Buffett, who made his $73 billion fortune from investments, donated $2.8 billion to charity in 2014,

110
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:42,560
bringing his lifetime total to almost $23 billion according to Forbes.

111
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,319
That's a tidy sum and that means a large number.

112
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,720
Okay, let's hear those words again Sophie.

113
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,360
Here they are.

114
00:05:50,319 --> 00:06:01,439
Pledge, philanthropy, well off, human potential, equality, unethical, ruthless, average Joe,

115
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,879
donating a tidy sum.

116
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,279
Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

117
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,040
Please join us again soon. Goodbye.

118
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,600
Bye bye.

119
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
From the BBC.
