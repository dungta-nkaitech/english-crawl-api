Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Neil.

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,080
And I'm Rob. In this program, we'll be discussing climate change and teaching you some useful

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,039
vocabulary so you can talk about it too. Such as emitters, a word used to describe countries,

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,399
industries or just things that produce harmful substances that harm the environment.

6
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:41,439
Substances such as carbon dioxide, an example of a greenhouse gas. These gases contribute to our

7
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:47,599
warming planet. And we're going to be discussing whether the world's two biggest emitters of greenhouse

8
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:52,719
gases, the USA and China, can work together for the good of the environment.

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,439
But a question for you first, Rob. In November this year, world leaders are due to meet at a

10
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:07,680
climate conference in which city will this be taking place? Is it A, Brisbane, B, Glasgow or C,

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,120
Vienna? Well, I've heard about this so I think it's the Scottish city of Glasgow.

12
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,519
Okay, Rob, I'll tell you if you are right or wrong later. Let's talk more about climate change,

13
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:26,560
back in 2015, world leaders met in Paris. It was the first time virtually all the nations of the

14
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,039
world came together to agree they all needed to tackle the issue. Under the terms of the Paris

15
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:39,280
deal, countries promised to come back every five years and raise their carbon-cutting ambitions.

16
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,920
An ambition is something you want to achieve even if it's difficult to do so.

17
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,920
President Trump pulled out of this Paris agreement, but now President Biden has brought the USA back

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,760
into it. But the USA still has a lot to do to help reduce its contribution to air pollution.

19
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,159
In China, where smog is a common occurrence, President Xi Jinping has pledged the country

20
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,800
will be carbon neutral by 2060. That means it will do things to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide

21
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,960
by the same amount that it produces. The BBC World Service Programme, the Climate Question,

22
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:21,120
has been looking at this in more detail. BBC journalist Vincent Nie explains why Xi Jinping's plans

23
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,520
might be tricky to achieve. What I'm really thinking is that this is actually a real

24
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,439
inherent paradox of today's China. It is leading many ways on green initiatives,

25
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,160
why at the same time it's also a big polluter and a greenhouse gas emitter.

26
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:45,120
It's got to alleviate poverty as well as fight pollution. The thing to watch now is how the

27
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:52,400
dynamic would play out in the next few years. So China currently has two things going on, one good,

28
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,359
one bad, an impossible situation because it has two opposite factors, what Vincent called a paradox.

29
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,240
And this paradox is that on one hand China has many projects to improve the environment,

30
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,640
but on the other hand it is a big polluter. And as well as tackling pollution, Vincent also said

31
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:20,480
China has to alleviate poverty. Eliviate means make less severe or serious. But as we've said, China

32
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,400
is not alone. The USA is another big polluter, which is also trying to develop ways to clean up

33
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,160
its act, an informal way of saying change the way it behaves for the better. President Biden

34
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:39,199
wants the US to achieve a 100% clean energy economy and reach net zero emissions by 2050.

35
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:45,199
He also wants to create 10 million new green jobs. Green means related to protecting and helping

36
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:51,439
the environment. The former governor of California, Jerry Brown, who's now with the California China

37
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:57,840
Climate Institute at Berkeley also spoke to the Climate Question Program. He thinks the USA should

38
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,800
do its bit to help climate change, but it also involves working together globally.

39
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:12,159
We have to really face reality with humility. We have put more heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere

40
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:18,720
that are still there than China has. That's the historical fact. So I think we need to stop

41
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,360
pointing fingers as though evil is outside. And we have to work with China and Russia and Europe,

42
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:33,520
and everywhere else as partners in humankind's very dangerous path forward. So I worry more about

43
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:40,720
that than figuring out all the flaws of which there are many in my competitor friends and enemies.

44
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,280
Jerry talks about facing the situation with humility. So not trying to be more important than

45
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,520
others in admitting your bad qualities. He says the USA should not think evil, the polluters in this

46
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:57,199
case are from elsewhere. Stop pointing fingers at other people.

47
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,599
Yes, the solution may be is not to blame others but to work together, trust each other,

48
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:08,959
and make tough choices rather than pointing out each other's flaws, faults or mistakes.

49
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,680
Hopefully many countries can work together more when they attend this year's climate conference

50
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,959
Rob, but in which city? Ah yes, I said Glasgow in Scotland. Was I right?

51
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,759
You were, Rob, well done. World leaders are due to meet there in November this year.

52
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,000
Right now there's just time to recap on some of the vocabulary we've discussed.

53
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,560
Yes, we talked about emitters, countries, industries or just things that produce or emit

54
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,919
harmful substances that harm the environment. Ambitions are things you want to achieve even if

55
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:46,399
they are difficult. A paradox is an impossible situation because it has two opposite factors.

56
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,439
To alleviate means make less severe or serious. Humility involves trying not to be more important

57
00:05:53,439 --> 00:06:00,079
than others and admitting your bad qualities. And flaws is another word for faults or mistakes.

58
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,639
Well, hopefully there are no flaws in this programme. That's all for now but we'll be back again

59
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,479
soon to discuss more trending topics and vocabulary here at 6 Minute English. Goodbye for now. Bye.
