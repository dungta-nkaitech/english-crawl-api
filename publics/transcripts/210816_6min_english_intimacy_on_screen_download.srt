00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,679
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,679
And I'm Georgina. When we think about romantic Hollywood movies,

6
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,039
there have been some famous examples over the years.

7
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,600
There are classic black and white romance movies like

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,320
1951's a street car named Desire, and the love affair between Humphrey Bogart

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,840
and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca, made in 1942.

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,640
You're really showing your age, Neil.

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,920
What about more recent movies like When Harry Met Sally?

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,560
Or that famous kiss between the characters Jack and Rose in the film Titanic?

13
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,200
In their time, all these movies were blockbusters,

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,680
very popular and successful films which sold millions of cinematic hits.

15
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,159
And this success was often due to the on-screen romance between the leading actors.

16
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,679
In romantic movies, love is in the air.

17
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,000
Couples hold hands and kiss, or in other words, they show intimacy,

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,480
a close romantic or sexual relationship.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,039
But while real couples kiss and hold hands all the time,

20
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:16,000
actors in movies are just pretending to be intimate,

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,680
and this can lead to problems.

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes, whether it's a kiss or a full nudity sex scene,

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,159
filming intimate scenes from movies and TV is a delicate business,

24
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,319
as we'll be finding out in this programme.

25
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,079
But first, Georgina, I have a quiz question for you.

26
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,840
Let me guess. Another black and white classic from the 1950s?

27
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,719
Yes, 1953 to be exact.

28
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,400
This movie won the Oscar for Best Picture.

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,240
The film thrilled audiences with a famous beach kiss between actors,

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,240
Bert Lancaster and Dev Recur, as they rolled around in the waves.

31
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,799
But what was the movie? Was it A, West Side Story, B,

32
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,679
from here to eternity, or C, Singing in the Rain?

33
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,919
Well, 1953 was a long before I was born, but I'll guess B, from here to eternity.

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,280
Okay, Georgina, we'll find out later on if that's right.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,159
In 1953, an on-screen kiss was still considered a little naughty.

36
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:17,919
But by 2020 and the filming of the BBC television dramas Normal People,

37
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,199
and I may destroy you, things had changed.

38
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,319
nudity and sexual content had become commonplace.

39
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,919
Eta O'Brien worked on both these BBC dramas.

40
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,439
She describes herself as an intimacy coordinator,

41
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,759
someone who helps actors and directors plan and film intimate scenes.

42
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:40,639
Listen as she gives her definition of intimacy to BBC World Service programme,

43
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,679
the conversation.

44
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:47,759
A handhold, a stroke of the cheek, you know, through to a hug,

45
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,799
and then obviously right the way through to intimate content.

46
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:55,280
It might be familial content of an adult to a child.

47
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,799
It could be the content of perhaps a medical procedure,

48
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:04,959
someone having, you know, a mammogram or it could be right the way through to intimacy,

49
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,399
you know, similar to sexual content.

50
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,799
Eta's definition of intimacy is very wide,

51
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,759
including hugging and stroking, gently touching someone in a pleasurable way.

52
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,399
It also includes simulated sex.

53
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:22,319
Movie actors aren't really having sex, they're simulating it,

54
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,599
pretending to do something so that it looks real but is not.

55
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:31,359
Just like dance sequences in musicals, intimate movie scenes are planned and choreographed

56
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:36,719
the forehand, so the director, film crew and above all the actors are comfortable with what's

57
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,359
being filmed.

58
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,599
But recent scandals about the on-set behaviour of some British and American film stars

59
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,159
have highlighted how delicate a balance this is.

60
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,519
Here's Eta O'Brien again talking to BBC World Services, the conversation

61
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,719
about the different ways that intimate scenes are filmed on either side of the Atlantic in Britain

62
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:57,599
and in the US.

63
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,639
With actors from the US, what they do have, what they put in place is that with each and every

64
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:10,400
intimate scene, we create a nudity, a stroke, a similar to sex, waiver for each and every scene.

65
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,280
And I actually really like that way of working.

66
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,720
In the UK, actors are asked to sign a nudity clause and generally that's an overall

67
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,920
for the whole of a production.

68
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:26,240
British actors sign only one document with a nudity clause to cover the whole film,

69
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,079
but in the US actors sign a waiver, a legal document that allows or prevents an action that is

70
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,079
different from how things are usually done.

71
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,040
Eta thinks it's better if the actors agree to each and every scene,

72
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,640
and she uses the phrase each and every because it emphasizes that she means every single one.

73
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,920
In this way, there is no confusion about what should or shouldn't happen on set,

74
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,480
leaving the director and actors free to make dramatic and romantic blockbusters.

75
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,280
You mean like that famous beach scene, kissing and rolling in the waves, Neil?

76
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,360
Ah, you mean my quiz question.

77
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,120
When I asked you, what was the name of the 1953 movie featuring a famous beach kiss between

78
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,840
movie stars Bert Lancaster and Deborah Kerr?

79
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,000
What did you say, Georgina?

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,639
I said it was B from here to eternity,

81
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,439
which is the right answer, well done Georgina, so you do like classic black and white movies after all.

82
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,480
Not really Neil, but I remember my granddad watching it.

83
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,199
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from this program about intimacy,

84
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,600
a close romantic or sexual relationship.

85
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,280
A blockbuster is a very popular and successful movie or a book that sells many copies.

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,080
If you stroke someone's face, you touch it gently in a pleasurable way.

87
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,720
To simulate means to do or make something that looks real, but is not.

88
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:52,800
In the US, a waiver is a legal document to either allow or prevent something being done

89
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,320
in a different way from usual.

90
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:00,320
And you can use the phrase each and every to emphasise that you mean every single one of something.

91
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,920
That's all for this romantic edition of Six Minute English, but join us here again soon

92
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,639
for more topical chat and useful vocabulary.

93
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,839
Bye for now.

94
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,639
Bye!
