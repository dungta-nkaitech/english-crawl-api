00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,599
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,879
And I'm Rob.

6
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:19,760
So it's nearly exam time again.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,000
And the subject of today's show is how to prepare well for an exam.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,160
I've got some great tips actually, Alice.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,440
Oh, have you really?

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,160
Can you remind me what grades you got at school?

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,640
Yes, well, oh, oh, oh, oh, what was it?

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,719
Oh, right. So you didn't get very good grades?

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,600
I probably should have started revising earlier.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,760
But my learning strategies were very good.

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,359
Oh, really? Well, when you revise for an exam,

16
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:47,600
you study information you learnt before.

17
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,680
Okay, Rob, I'd love to hear more about your learning strategies,

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,719
but first, here's today's quiz question for you.

19
00:00:54,799 --> 00:01:02,000
What's the word for a system such as use of special poems or rhymes to help you remember something?

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,879
Is it a, pneumatics, b, nomonics, or c, hypnotics?

21
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,840
I'll go for b, nomonics.

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,920
Well, we'll find out whether you got the answer right or not later on in the show.

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,439
Now, according to current scientific research,

24
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,759
some study methods popular with students aren't actually very effective.

25
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,240
Don't tell me, putting your textbook under your pillow at night doesn't work.

26
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,400
Did you try doing that, Rob?

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,120
Yes, I did, but without much success.

28
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,439
Maybe I was using the wrong kind of pillow?

29
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,080
Well, and let's talk about more conventional methods than the book under the pillow one.

30
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,040
These include summarising, highlighting, or underlining text to help you remember it.

31
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,439
I do love a pack of highlighting pens, though.

32
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,719
Oh, yes, me too.

33
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,319
And actually, highlighting text was one of my top tips.

34
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,519
But I used to get so absorbed with the highlighting.

35
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,239
I'm not sure I was actually learning anything useful.

36
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,319
My notebooks were works of art, though.

37
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,760
Yes, and that's the point made by John Dunlussky,

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,240
Professor of Psychology at Kent State University in the US,

39
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,319
who says that you need to do more than just highlight information.

40
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,400
You need to test yourself on it.

41
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,680
Let's hear from him now.

42
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:24,159
Students who can basically test themselves or try to retrieve material from their memory

43
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,680
are going to learn that material in the long run a lot better.

44
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,640
So, for instance, maybe you start by reading a textbook using your favourite highlighter and favourite colours.

45
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,719
But then you go back and make flashcards of all the critical concepts.

46
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,280
And instead of just rereading those, you basically try to test yourself on them.

47
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,400
Professor John Dunlussky there.

48
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,039
So he says trying to memorize the material isn't enough.

49
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,879
You need to do something with it.

50
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,520
For example, making flashcards of critical or important concepts

51
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,280
and then testing yourself on them.

52
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,680
By repeatedly testing yourself on something,

53
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,800
you strengthen the pathways between neurons or nerve cells in the brain.

54
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,439
And the more often you do this, the easier it becomes to retrieve information.

55
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,159
And retrieve means to get something back.

56
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,359
That's right.

57
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,120
When you repeatedly test yourself over a longer period of time,

58
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,759
for example, over months or weeks,

59
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,319
this is called distributed practice.

60
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,840
And psychologists believe this is a very effective way to learn.

61
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,240
It sounds like hard work, though, doesn't it?

62
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,560
I prefer the cramming method,

63
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,439
which means to try and learn lots of information in a short period of time.

64
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,680
For example, the night before the exam.

65
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,039
I don't know, Rob.

66
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,679
We don't cram to learn other things,

67
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:46,000
like music or dancing or football or language learning.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,959
It's far more effective to join a conversation class

69
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,959
and practice speaking every week

70
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,199
than to practice for hours in front of the mirror the night before your oral exam.

71
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,799
That's a good point.

72
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,319
In fact, I used to sing irregular French verbs to myself

73
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,919
every day in the shower for weeks before my French exam.

74
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,719
And that helped me remember them more easily.

75
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,519
Excellent.

76
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,280
Making different types of associations with what you're trying to learn,

77
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,120
for example, musical associations is meant to be effective.

78
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,360
Let's listen now to Professor Danowski talking about visual associations.

79
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,000
I would encourage students as they're reading to try to elaborate mentally

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,639
using images as they're reading to kind of develop a more vivid picture of what they're reading.

81
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,400
Again, that'll help quite a bit for some kinds of studies, maybe history and so forth,

82
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,639
and a little bit less so for more conceptual studies.

83
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,319
And if you elaborate on something, it means you add more information.

84
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,800
In this case, mental pictures.

85
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,879
So creating mental pictures is useful for some subjects,

86
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,879
like history or languages, but conceptual subjects,

87
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,759
ones based on abstract ideas rather than things like maths, for example,

88
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,519
it might not be so easy to associate ideas with pictures.

89
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,519
Now, what about Albert Einstein?

90
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,159
People say he was a very visual thinker.

91
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,920
Well, you've got me there, Rob.

92
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,040
I don't know the answer to that, but I can give you the answer to today's quiz question.

93
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,760
I asked, what's the word for a system,

94
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,400
such as use of special poems or rhymes, to help you remember something?

95
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,879
Is it A, pneumatics, B, pneumonics, or C, hypnotics?

96
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,400
I said pneumonics.

97
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,800
And you were right.

98
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,520
Great.

99
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,320
Well done.

100
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,599
Research on pneumonics suggests they are a good strategy

101
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,599
for learning certain kinds of things,

102
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:37,759
like how to spell difficult words.

103
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,279
For example, the first letters of this sentence.

104
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,480
Big elephants cause accidents under small elephants,

105
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,480
spells because.

106
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,839
Now, do you think you can remember the words we heard today, Rob?

107
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:59,519
We heard revise critical neurons retrieve distributed

108
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,879
practice, cramming, elaborate, conceptual.

109
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,439
Well, that's the end of today's six-minute English.
