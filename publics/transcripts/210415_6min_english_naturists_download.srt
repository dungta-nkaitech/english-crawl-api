6M from BBC Learning English.com

3
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,760
Hello, this is 6M in English from BBC Learning English. I'm Georgina.

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,800
And I'm Neil.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,199
Neil, this may sound a bit personal, but have you ever taken your clothes off?

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,800
Well, yes, every day when I have a shower.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,719
Of course, I mean in public, have you ever been naked in public?

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:37,200
No, stripping off or getting naked publicly is not my idea of fun.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,399
Who would enjoy doing that?

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,320
Well, nature is wood. That's what we call people who think not wearing clothes outdoors

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,159
is a healthy way to live, and it makes them feel good. We might also call them nudists,

12
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:51,120
because they are nude.

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,359
Right, so nature is feel being naked is natural.

14
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,240
It's not about them being interested in nature.

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:04,079
Not necessarily, but we are going to discuss why being naked in nature might be good for us.

16
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:06,319
But how about a question first, Neil?

17
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,560
The actor swimming naked is informally called skinny dipping.

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,359
The world's largest skinny dip took place in Ireland in 2018,

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,359
but do you know how many naked swimmers went into the sea?

20
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,920
Was it approximately A250 people?

21
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:27,120
B. 2500 people?

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,400
Or C. 25,000 people?

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:38,640
I'd have to guess and say that only 250 people would be brave enough to run into the cold sea naked.

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,680
Well, as always, I'll reveal the answer later.

25
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,040
So the idea of getting naked might fill you with dread.

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,799
It might seem embarrassing, but some people do some both naked on the beach or in their garden,

27
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,599
or they go to nature's holiday parks.

28
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:59,199
But naked rambling, walking naked in the countryside might be taking it one step further.

29
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:03,359
However, it's something Donna Price, a volunteer at British natureism,

30
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,319
is keen to advocate or publicly support.

31
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:11,039
Here she is speaking on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour programme, explaining why.

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,280
We enjoy the feeling of being actually at one with nature.

33
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,159
If you haven't actually tried being naked in nature and naked outdoors,

34
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:26,000
when you can feel the warmth air all over your skin, it's such a lovely feeling.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,039
There is a great feeling of liberation of freedom once you actually try natureism.

36
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:36,479
And I would never advocate for someone to actually go out for a naked walk as the first thing they ever did.

37
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,159
I just would not do that.

38
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,319
You've got to be comfortable in your own skin.

39
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,000
So you do it at home, in your own garden, maybe if you can.

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,479
Get comfortable with yourself.

41
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,359
Actually start to feel that being naked feels normal, which to me it does.

42
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:56,799
So for Donna, naked rambling means she has a connection with nature.

43
00:02:56,799 --> 00:02:59,359
She feels part of it and it makes her feel good.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,399
That's the feeling of being at one with nature.

45
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,439
But couldn't you do that with your clothes on?

46
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,280
Well, she also mentions there's a feeling of freedom and liberation.

47
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,199
That's being freed from something.

48
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,359
Here, it's freed from your clothes.

49
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,360
Donna also told the woman's hour program that going for a naked walk

50
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,600
shouldn't be the first thing you attempt to do.

51
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,600
You need to feel relaxed and confident with your actions first.

52
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,760
Or what we sometimes say is comfortable in your own skin.

53
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,920
Yes, she says we need to get to feel that nakedness is normal.

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,320
I suppose we were all born naked and it's not something to be ashamed of.

55
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,200
And in the UK at least, it's generally not against the law to be naked in public.

56
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,199
I'm still not convinced, but according to Donna Price,

57
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,879
this freedom of expression is quite well received when she's out walking.

58
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,959
Here she is speaking on the BBC's Woman's Hour program again.

59
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,399
Majority of the response is that you actually encounter, if you do encounter the public,

60
00:03:58,399 --> 00:04:02,959
the general public, are actually very encouraging.

61
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,319
They're not shock-horror, majority of the time.

62
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,679
I can guarantee you that.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,599
A lot of people say just good morning and carry on.

64
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,520
Some of them actually say, gosh, you're braver than I am, if it's virtually.

65
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,840
A lot of them are just saying, I really wish I could do that.

66
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,840
And usually we just say, you can.

67
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,439
So the people Donna encounters or meets seem to support what she's doing.

68
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,680
She says it's not shock-horror.

69
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,800
This is usually said as an informal way of actually saying something is not surprising,

70
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,840
not shocking.

71
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,159
Well, shock-horror, Neil, I won't be taking my clothes off anytime soon.

72
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:45,279
It's too cold anyway and I don't want to be bitten by all those bugs you get in the countryside.

73
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,120
But it's good to hear that people are open-minded to the idea.

74
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,759
Yes, good luck to anyone who wants to give it a try and well done to those brave people who took

75
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,239
part in the world's biggest skinny dip, a mass naked swim.

76
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:04,079
Earlier, Georgina, you asked me how many people took part in the event in Ireland in 2018.

77
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,759
I did and you said?

78
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,560
I said about 250 people went for a dip.

79
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,519
Was I right?

80
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,240
No, Neil.

81
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,079
According to Guinness World Records,

82
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:19,519
2,505 women took part in the largest charity skinny dip in Wicklow in Ireland.

83
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:25,279
Well, well done to them and skinny dipping was one of the items of vocabulary we discussed today.

84
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:28,560
This is an informal way of describing the act of swimming naked.

85
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,959
We've also been discussing natureists.

86
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:36,959
People who think not wearing clothes outdoors is a healthy way to live and it makes them feel good.

87
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,680
The act of doing this is called natureism.

88
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,799
And when you advocate something like natureism for example, you publicly support it.

89
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:49,759
Being at one with nature means having a connection with the natural world that makes you feel good.

90
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,519
And liberation means being freed from something.

91
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,199
And when we say shock horror, we actually mean the opposite.

92
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,519
I mean something is not shocking or surprising.

93
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,279
We're being sarcastic I guess.

94
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,680
It's not like you to be sarcastic, Neil.

95
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,159
But shock horror, we're out of time now.

96
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:09,199
We only get six minutes and that's the naked truth.

97
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,039
Thanks for listening and goodbye.

98
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:11,759
Goodbye.
