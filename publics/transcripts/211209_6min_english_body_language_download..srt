6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish.com

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,839
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:25,280
And I'm Sam. When Neil and I record 6 Minute English face to face in the BBC Learning English

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:31,359
studio, which I'm happy to say we are doing right now, we look at each other as we speak.

7
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:38,240
We smile and use hand gestures and facial expressions in a type of communication called body language.

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,760
But during the Covid pandemic, everyday meetings with work colleagues, teachers and friends,

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,520
and 6 Minute English recordings all moved online.

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,960
Video meetings using software like Zoom and Skype became the normal way to communicate with

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,039
family and friends. And whenever it happens with Covid in the future, it seems they're here to stay.

12
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,519
In this programme, we'll be asking, how has body language changed in the world of online video meetings?

13
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,120
We'll meet the person who wrote the rule book for clear communication in the digital age,

14
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,359
Erica Darwin, author of a new book, Digital Body Language.

15
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,159
But before that, I have a question for you, Sam, and it's about Erica Darwin.

16
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,479
She may be a communications expert now, but growing up in Pennsylvania, she was a shy and quiet

17
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,879
school girl. So how did Erica beat her shyness and become the confident communicator she is today?

18
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,319
Did she A, attend public speaking classes?

19
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:43,039
B, copy the body language of the cool kids at school, or C, raise her hand to answer the teacher's

20
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:46,079
questions, even if she didn't know the answer.

21
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,640
I guess C, she raised her hand to answer the teacher's questions.

22
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,560
Okay, Sam, we'll reveal the correct answer later in the programme.

23
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,079
In face-to-face meetings, we immediately see someone's reaction to what we said through eye contact,

24
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,519
where two people look into each other's eyes as they talk.

25
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:11,520
Unfortunately, using a web camera to make eye contact is almost impossible in online meetings,

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,199
and this often creates a kind of distancing effect.

27
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,319
Erica Darwin makes several suggestions to help with this.

28
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,119
See if you can hear the final suggestion she makes to Michael Rosen as part of BBC Radio 4,

29
00:02:25,119 --> 00:02:25,919
Word of mouth.

30
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:34,000
And last but not least, slow down. Remember when it was completely normal to have a one-minute pause

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,599
in a room with one another, because we knew where we were thinking and brainstorming.

32
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,839
If we don't hear someone speak on video, we ask them if they're on mute.

33
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,840
Practice what I call the five-second rule.

34
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,879
Wait five seconds before speaking to make sure individuals have time to process the ideas,

35
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,480
especially if there may be technology or accessibility issues.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,879
Did you hear Erica's last piece of advice, Neil?

37
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,800
Yes, she recommends slowing down, something we do naturally face-to-face when we're thinking

38
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,960
or brainstorming. That's discussing suggestions with a group of people to come up with new ideas

39
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,159
or to solve problems.

40
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,960
Slowing down gives us time to process new information, to understand it by thinking carefully

41
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,480
and reflecting on it.

42
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,040
Erica compares online body language to learning a new language.

43
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,360
It takes practice, especially when it comes to smiling and laughing.

44
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,879
Something Michael Rosen finds hard to do in video meetings.

45
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,240
Listen to him discussing this problem with Erica Darwin, the BBC Radio 4's Word of mouth.

46
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,920
Do you think it's killing off people, laughing and smiling in the way we do when we're all together

47
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,200
in the live situation?

48
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,680
I would say that it is much less likely that we laugh and smile on camera for a few reasons.

49
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,320
Number one, laughing is often done in unison, where we can quickly pick up the energy of someone

50
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,280
smiling or laughing and feed off of that and laugh ourselves.

51
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,080
When it comes to screen delays, the fact that it's not natural to see our own camera

52
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,640
being distracted by that, we are much more less likely to laugh and smile.

53
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,640
One of the ways we can overcome this is by creating intentional moments in our meetings for

54
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,920
the water cooler effect.

55
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:24,160
Erica points out that laughing often happens in unison, together and at the same time.

56
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,040
Yes, if someone starts laughing, it makes me laugh too.

57
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,199
She also thinks it's important to make time for employees to chat informally about things

58
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,439
unrelated to work, though we can plans or last night's TV show.

59
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,439
And she uses the expression, the water cooler effect, which comes from the United States,

60
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,759
where office workers sometimes meet at the water fountain to chat.

61
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,120
So the water cooler effect refers to informal conversations that people have in their office

62
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,439
or workplace, maybe in the lift, the office kitchen or if there is one by an actual water cooler.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,600
Erica Darwin seems very comfortable communicating online, but she's had lots of time to practice

64
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,719
since her school days.

65
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:12,560
Ah, yes, Neil, in your quiz question, you asked how Erica conquered her shyness at school.

66
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,720
I guess that she raised her hand to answer the teacher's questions.

67
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,560
It was a good guess, Sam, but the correct answer is B. She copied the body language of her

68
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,680
cool teenage classmates, so probably lots of rolled eyes and slouching.

69
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,600
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from this program about online body language,

70
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,959
nonverbal ways of communicating using the body.

71
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,759
Eye contact is when two people look at each other's eyes at the same time.

72
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,960
Brain storming involves a group discussion to generate new ideas or solutions.

73
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,000
When we process information, we think about it carefully in order to understand it.

74
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,240
In unison means happening together and at the same time.

75
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,280
And finally, the water cooler effect is an American expression to describe

76
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,639
informal conversations between people at work.

77
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,759
Neil is looking at his watch, which is body language that tells me our six minutes are up.

78
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,639
Goodbye for now.

79
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,120
Goodbye.
