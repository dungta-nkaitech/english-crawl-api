5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,400
Hello, this is 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,439
And I'm Catherine.

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:17,920
Catherine, are you flexitarian?

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,000
Oh no, I'm not really religious, Neil.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,280
It's not a religion, it's a diet.

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,160
It means mainly eating plant-based foods

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,080
and only occasionally eating meat.

12
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:29,679
Oh, I see.

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,559
Sorry.

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:32,960
Well, I don't eat too much meat,

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,000
so I'm kind of on the way to flexitarianism.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,719
Some people don't eat meat for ethical reasons.

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,119
That means that for them, it's wrong to eat meat.

18
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,320
It's wrong that animals should be killed for our food.

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,039
But one of the reasons for being flexitarian

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,119
and only eating meat once in a while

21
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,280
is for the benefit of the planet.

22
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,000
According to a recent report, being flexitarian

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,840
is healthier for the individual

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,480
that can also help to fight climate change.

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,600
Before we look in more detail at this topic, a question.

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,520
Do you like peppers, Catherine?

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,480
Yes, I do.

28
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,120
Is that correct?

29
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,520
Well, that's not the quiz question, but this is.

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,400
All peppers are in the same food group.

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,000
What group is it?

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,920
Are peppers fruit, vegetables, or herbs?

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,560
Any ideas?

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,000
This one sounds like a trick question,

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,600
but I think it's obviously vegetables.

36
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,039
Well, you'll have to wait a bit to find out.

37
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,879
I'll have the answer later in the program.

38
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:34,319
Now, Dr. Marco Springman is from the University of Oxford

39
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,280
and was one of the lead authors of a major report

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,359
that looked at the global food system

41
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,879
and how it affects the climate.

42
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,000
On the BBC Today program, he talked about what changes would be needed.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,919
Does he mention just one thing?

44
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,000
We really found that a combination of measures

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
would be needed to stay within environmental limits.

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,760
And those include changes towards healthier, more plant-based diets,

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,799
ambitious technological improvements

48
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,040
and changes in farming management,

49
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,120
and a reduction of food loss and waste.

50
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,759
So, did he mention just one thing, Catherine?

51
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,960
No, not at all.

52
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,560
He said that there would need to be a combination of measures,

53
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,680
which means a variety of different actions,

54
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,040
including moving to a plant-based diet,

55
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,879
developing technology, changing the way we farm

56
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,800
and wasting less food.

57
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,719
He described the need for ambitious technological improvements.

58
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,159
Ambitious here means the developments will have to be impressive

59
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,159
above the ordinary, not simple.

60
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,040
Dr. Springman was asked if we had to completely remove meat from the food

61
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,400
that we eat to be healthy.

62
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,319
What was his recommendation?

63
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:54,479
Well, we surveyed literature on what a healthy diet is.

64
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,319
And according to that, if you treat it as luxury, it's probably okay,

65
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,359
but you shouldn't have more than one serving of red meat,

66
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:04,079
which includes beef and pork per week.

67
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:08,560
So, the more plant-based to go, you go the healthier and the lower

68
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,079
and environmental impacts in the food.

69
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:11,680
And lamb is just the same?

70
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,079
Yes.

71
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,799
So, do we need to cut out meat entirely?

72
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,320
He says that, while a plant-based diet is certainly healthier,

73
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,240
you could still have some red meat, but only once a week.

74
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,280
Yes, he said, think of it as a luxury.

75
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,280
A luxury food is one that we really enjoy that don't eat very often.

76
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,840
Perhaps because it's very expensive or rare.

77
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,480
Or delicious, but very bad for us.

78
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,439
We eat it as a treat, but not every day.

79
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,000
Springman says we should think of red meat in the same way.

80
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,120
It shouldn't be a regular part of our diet.

81
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,879
How did he come to this opinion?

82
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,000
Did they just make it up themselves because it sounds like a good idea?

83
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,080
Not at all, Neil.

84
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,039
He said that they surveyed the literature.

85
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,599
This means that as part of their report,

86
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,319
they studied different scientific research that had previously been published.

87
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,280
Their advice is based on the evidence of those research papers.

88
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,479
Okay, now the answer to our quiz question.

89
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,199
I asked to what food group do peppers belong?

90
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,599
Was it A, fruit, B, vegetables, C, herbs?

91
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:22,639
Catherine, you said.

92
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,240
I said B, vegetables.

93
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:25,519
Oh dear.

94
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,199
Good try, but not right.

95
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,480
Thanks for playing.

96
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,319
The answer is A, fruit.

97
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:31,439
Fruit?

98
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:33,439
Really?

99
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,159
Yes.

100
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:37,279
A fruit is the part of a plant that contains the seeds.

101
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:42,959
So peppers, like tomatoes, pumpkins, avocados, and olives are actually fruit.

102
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:44,879
Well done if you got that one right.

103
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,239
Now our vocabulary.

104
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:48,799
Our first word is flexitarian.

105
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:51,759
This is the term for a diet that is mainly plant based,

106
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,519
but can include meat occasionally.

107
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,159
Our next word is ethical.

108
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:59,839
This is in the context of choosing not to eat meat.

109
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,199
Some people are vegetarian because they don't like meat.

110
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,839
Some because they want a healthier diet.

111
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,039
And some for ethical reasons,

112
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,799
this means that their choice is because they feel it is the right thing

113
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,639
The next phrase was a combination of measures.

114
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,600
This means taking different actions to achieve something,

115
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,040
not just doing one thing.

116
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,520
We then had ambitious.

117
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,800
If a person's ambitious, it means they want to get on in life and be successful.

118
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,759
But ambitious can also be used to describe a plan or achievement

119
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,199
which is impressive and above the ordinary.

120
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,000
The next phrase was to survey the literature.

121
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,959
This means to study and analyse the different scientific research on a particular subject.

122
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,680
And finally we had luxury.

123
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,759
When talking about food, a luxury is something that we only eat occasionally as a special treat

124
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,519
because it's expensive or unhealthy, but delicious.

125
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,079
Well, I'm off for a plate of delicious vegetables.

Bye.
