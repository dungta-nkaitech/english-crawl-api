Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Rob.

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,960
And I'm Sam.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,800
So, how are you today, Sam?

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,080
Oh, don't ask, Rob. Today's been a nightmare.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,280
This morning, I ripped my jeans and later my computer stuff working.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,039
Then when I tried taking it to a repair shop, my car wouldn't start.

9
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:35,760
Oh, no, that's terrible.

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,760
And the really bad news is that in today's consumer culture,

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,439
when something breaks, we usually throw it away and buy a new one,

12
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:45,359
instead of trying to repair it.

13
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,200
In this programme, we'll learn all about repairing broken things

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,920
by asking what would happen if we stopped

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,480
junking and got better at fixing.

16
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:59,919
The world generates over two billion tons of rubbish every year.

17
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:02,479
So, we're visiting companies in Sweden,

18
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,599
making it easier to mend things when they break,

19
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:10,079
instead of replacing them, whether that's clothes, bikes or washing machines.

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,640
A Mike Wis question is about one of those companies, Fixie,

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,159
a repair service that collects broken bikes from your door

22
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,239
and brings them back fixed.

23
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,039
The company was started by Raffi Mahamid,

24
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,120
a student of industrial innovation at the University of Stockholm.

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,680
But what was the inspiration behind Raffi's idea?

26
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,960
Was it A, he wanted to impress his girlfriend?

27
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,640
B, he was sick of breathing in the city's car fumes,

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,800
or C, he was late for his lecture because of a flat tire.

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,240
Also A, he wanted to impress his girlfriend.

30
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,200
Okay, Sam, we'll find out about Raffi and his love life later on.

31
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,879
But whatever the inspiration behind it, Raffi's idea was a success.

32
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,799
Fixie took more than 600 orders in its first six months.

33
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,799
Raffi isn't the only Swedish company helping people fix things instead of buying new.

34
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,520
Denham Company Newdy Jeans was started with a focus on ethics and sustainability.

35
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,039
At $150 a pair, Newdy Jeans aren't cheap,

36
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,480
but they do promise free repairs for life.

37
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,039
From Ripney's to Torn pockets.

38
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,879
BBC World Service Programme People Fixing the World

39
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,280
asked students Felix and Fabian Morgan why they bought the Jeans despite the high price tag.

40
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,719
It's just been given that when your jeans break, you throw them away.

41
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,159
So when I heard that you can be repaired them easily without any costs,

42
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,239
there was a bit of a no-brainer for me.

43
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:47,439
I really liked waiting in the book.

44
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:53,199
So for me, it's worth it to buy more expensive but stuff that I really like.

45
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,840
Felix says that throwing out old jeans is a given, something that is just assumed to happen.

46
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,079
For him, buying Newdy Jeans is a no-brainer, a decision that's very easy to make.

47
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:12,000
And Fabia agrees. She doesn't mind paying more for stuff she really likes.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,039
Here, stuff is an informal way to say personal objects and possessions.

49
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:23,199
Even though they're good at recycling, people in wealthy Sweden still buy lots of new stuff

50
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,039
and they have a big carbon footprint for a country of just 10 million.

51
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,079
But it's interesting that all the innovators behind these companies say that in their grandparents day,

52
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,919
it was normal to repair, fix and mend broken stuff.

53
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,079
Jessica Ricksert is a researcher at Lung University.

54
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:46,879
She thinks repairing is an endangered activity that we use to do more of,

55
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,359
both individually and as a society.

56
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:55,039
Here she is talking to BBC World Services people fixing the world program

57
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,719
about the need to get back in touch with older ways of doing things.

58
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,519
Really is a pure effect and a culture that we're trying to foster here,

59
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:10,240
changing a culture of consumption. The more people that are repairing and the more people that

60
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,120
are choosing to buy repair services or more repairable products, the more we will see this going

61
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,800
mainstream and it used to be mainstream. So that's what makes me positive too.

62
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,920
That it is in some ways a return to what we used to be able as a society to do more of.

63
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,199
Stories about Sweden's repair shops spread between friends and Jessica thinks this creates a

64
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,120
peer effect. The positive or negative influence friends have on the way you behave.

65
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,759
She hopes this will foster or encourage to grow a new culture of sustainable consumption

66
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:50,639
so that fixing broken stuff will be mainstream or be considered normal once again.

67
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,839
Yes that's a big part of the problem. Repairing was something we all used to do but seem to have

68
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:01,599
forgotten. Hopefully we'll all be inspired to start fixing things again or at least pay someone

69
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:06,959
else too. And speaking of inspiration, what was the answer to your quiz question Rob?

70
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,879
Ah yes I asked about the inspiration behind Raffi Muhammad's company Fixi.

71
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,680
And I think he started the bike repair service to a impresser's girlfriend. Was I right?

72
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:26,319
Ah Sam that's very romantic but the correct answer was see he was late for his lecture because

73
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,399
of a flat tire. Oh well I'm sure if he had a broken heart he'd be able to mend it.

74
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:38,000
Indeed. Well in this program we've been hearing about repairing broken stuff, things or personal

75
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:45,920
that people would fix something broken used to be a given assumed to be true or certain to happen.

76
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:52,800
Repairing things used to be a no-brainer the obvious choice. A peer effect is influence appears

77
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,319
in friends on someone's behaviour. Some Swedish companies are trying to foster or encourage

78
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:05,199
the development of a new culture of consumption. So that once again fixing things is mainstream

79
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:11,279
accepted as normal or common practice. Well that's all from us. Bye for now. Bye bye.
