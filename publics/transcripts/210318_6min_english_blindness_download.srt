4
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,039
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,400
And I'm Georgina.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,199
What do Homer, Ray Charles and Jorge Borges all have in common, Georgina?

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,640
Mmm, so that's the ancient Greek poet Homer.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,920
American singer Ray Charles and Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges.

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,000
I can't see much in common there, Neil.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,560
Well, the answer is that they were all blind.

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,960
Ah, but that obviously didn't hold them back.

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,840
I mean, there were some of the greatest artists ever.

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,320
Right, but I wonder how easy they would find it living and working in the modern world.

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,240
Blind people can use a guide dog or a white cane to help them move around.

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,840
Yes, but a white cane is hardly advanced technology.

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,320
Recently, smartphone apps have been invented, which dramatically improved the lives of blind people around the world.

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,760
In this programme on blindness in the digital age, we'll be looking at some of these inventions,

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,040
known collectively as assistive technology.

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,040
That's any software or equipment that helps people work around their disabilities or challenges.

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,080
But first, it's time for my quiz question, Georgina.

21
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,079
In 1842, a technique of using fingers to feel printed raised dots was invented,

22
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,159
which allowed blind people to read.

23
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,679
But who invented it?

24
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:33,439
Was it A, Margaret Walker, B, Louis Braille, or C, Samuel Morse?

25
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,840
Mmm, I've heard of Morse code, but that wouldn't help blind people read.

26
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,159
So I think it's B, Louis Braille.

27
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay, Georgina, we'll find out the answer at the end of the programme.

28
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,280
One remarkable feature of the latest assistive technology is its practicality.

29
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,159
Smartphone apps like B, My Eyes allow blind users to find lost keys,

30
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,439
cross-bisie roads and even colour match their clothes.

31
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,480
Brian Mahwenda is CEO of a Kenyan company developing this kind of technology.

32
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,439
Here he explains to BBC World Service programme Digital Planet

33
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,240
how his devices seek to enhance, not replace the traditional white cane.

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,480
The device is very compatible with any kind of white cane.

35
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,080
So once you clip it onto any white cane, it works perfectly to detect the obstacles in front of you.

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,400
And it relies on echolocation.

37
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,480
So echolocation is the same technology used by bats and dolphins to detect prey

38
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,320
and obstacles and all that.

39
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,160
You send out sound pulse and then once it bounces off an obstacle,

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,719
you can tell how far the obstacle is.

41
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,120
When attached to a white cane, the digital device called Sixth Sense

42
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,719
can detect obstacles, objects which block your way,

43
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,280
making it difficult for you to move forward.

44
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,520
Sixth Sense works using echolocation, a kind of ultrasound like that used by bats

45
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,439
who send out sound waves which bounce off surrounding objects.

46
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,680
The returning echoes show where these objects are located.

47
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,560
Some of the assistive apps are so smart they can even tell what kind of object is coming up

48
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,719
ahead, be it a friend, a shop door or a speeding car.

49
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,520
I guess being able to move around confidently really boost people's independence.

50
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,840
Absolutely and it's challenging stereotypes around blindness too.

51
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,199
Blogger Fern Lullam who is blind herself uses assistive apps every day.

52
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,640
Here she is talking to BBC World Services Digital Planet.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,080
I think the more that society sees blind people in the community at work, in relationships,

54
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,640
it does help to tackle all of these stereotypes.

55
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,800
It helps people to see blind and visually impaired people in a whole new way

56
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,720
and it just normalises disability.

57
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,520
That's what we need.

58
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,720
We need to see people just getting on with their life and doing it

59
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,520
and then people won't see it as such a big deal anymore.

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,120
It'll just be the ordinary.

61
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,640
Fern distinguishes between people who are blind or unable to see

62
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,280
and those who are visually impaired experience a decreased ability to see.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,960
Assistive tech helps blind people lead normal,

64
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,840
independent lives within their local communities.

65
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,840
Fern hopes that this will help normalise disability.

66
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,519
Treat something as normal, which has not been accepted as normal before.

67
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,279
So being blind doesn't have to be a big deal

68
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,720
and in formal way to say something is not a serious problem.

69
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,560
Just keep your eyes closed for a minute and try moving around the room.

70
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,199
You'll soon see how difficult it is and how life-changing this technology can be.

71
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,319
Being able to read books must also open up a world of imagination.

72
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,559
So what was the answer to your quiz question now?

73
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,559
I asked Georgina who invented the system of reading

74
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:50,559
where fingertips are used to fill patterns of printed raised dots.

75
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,159
What did you say Georgina?

76
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,159
I thought it was B, Louis Braille.

77
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:58,239
Which was of course the correct answer well done Georgina.

78
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,279
Louis Braille, the inventor of a reading system,

79
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,239
which is known worldwide simply as Braille.

80
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,319
I suppose Braille is an early example of assistive technology.

81
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:13,199
Systems and equipment that assist people with disabilities to perform everyday functions.

82
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,160
Let's recap the rest of the vocabulary now.

83
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,519
Okay, an obstacle is an object that is in your way and blocks your movement.

84
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,600
Some assistive technology works using echolocation,

85
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,879
a system of ultrasound detection used by bats.

86
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,639
Being blind is different from being visually impaired,

87
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:36,159
having a decreased ability to see whether disabling or not.

88
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:41,839
And finally, the hope is that assistive phonapse can help normalize disability,

89
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,279
change the perception of something into being accepted as normal.

90
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,599
So that disability is no longer a big deal, not a big problem.

91
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:54,240
