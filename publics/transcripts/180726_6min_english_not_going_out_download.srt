5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,880
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,320
Hi and I'm Catherine.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,640
No, Catherine. When was the last time you went for a walk in the country for fun,

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,719
for exercise or relaxation?

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:24,240
People do that?

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,320
Well, believe it or not, they do.

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,800
Oh, interesting. People are strange.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,719
Well, it sounds like you should pay close attention to today's programme,

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,600
because it's all about how fewer and fewer people are venturing out into the country.

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,880
Well, I wonder if that word is part of the problem.

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:47,359
To venture out somewhere suggests that it's a really big challenge or even a risky activity.

16
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:52,799
I don't think a walk in the country is a particularly dangerous activity, even in bad weather.

17
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,040
It's not one of the reasons people gave in a recent survey for why they don't do it.

18
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,799
In fact, one of the biggest reasons people gave was that it wouldn't look good on their social media.

19
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,480
Well, of course. Why would you go for a walk in the rain in the country

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,079
if you couldn't get good snaps for your social media account?

21
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,159
Interesting. You should say that because it's the topic of this week's quiz question.

22
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,200
In the survey, what percentage of people gave the poor social media photo opportunity

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,719
as their reason for not wanting to venture out into the countryside?

24
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:29,200
Was it A around 10% B around 30% or C around 50%? What do you think?

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,319
To be honest, I don't think that would be a good excuse at all,

26
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,359
so I'm going to say it's just 10%.

27
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,439
Listen out for the answer at the end of the programme.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,519
Annabelle Shackleton is from an organisation called Leif,

29
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:47,200
linking environment and farming. They want to encourage more people to visit the countryside.

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,280
She recently appeared on the BBC's Farming Today Radio programme.

31
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,560
She gave her response to the survey we mentioned, which revealed that many of us prefer to stay indoors.

32
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,200
What does she say a quarter of people in the survey know and believe?

33
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,359
I can't believe that four in 10 millennials think that they should spend more time in the countryside

34
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:13,439
and a quarter of them know and believe that it's much better and easier to relax in the countryside,

35
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,400
but they're just not going out. It's phenomenal.

36
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,520
She was talking about a group in the survey which she called millennials.

37
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:29,520
This term refers to people who are young adults now, people who were born in the 1980s and 1990s.

38
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,360
Are you a millennial, Neil?

39
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,759
No, I'm actually Generation X, the age group before millennials.

40
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,120
We were born in the 1960s, 70s and early 80s.

41
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:45,200
Shackleton said that a quarter of millennials know and believe that it's better and easier to relax

42
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,519
in the country, but they just don't go.

43
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,599
She thought it was phenomenal.

44
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,399
Now this adjective means that something is incredible, unbelievable.

45
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:59,599
It's often used for something that's positive, something's very impressive or amazing.

46
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,079
In this case though, she is using it to say how shocked and surprised she is,

47
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:07,919
that people know going out in the country is good and a great way to relax,

48
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,759
but they still don't do it.

49
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,679
So what explanation does she have for this phenomenal behaviour?

50
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,200
Here's Annabelle Shackleton again.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,400
There are just so many other distractions and it's just so easy for people to stay indoors.

52
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,319
You know, when they're using excuses like they haven't got the right closing,

53
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,439
it's not Instagrammable, would you believe it?

54
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,200
And yes, it's a shame.

55
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,120
She said that there are many other distractions.

56
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,000
A distraction is something that takes your attention away from doing something.

57
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,879
Usually we think of a distraction as something that delays us from doing something more important.

58
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,520
These days we have a lot of distractions or things that offer us easy entertainment,

59
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,159
and so it's very easy to come up with an excuse for not taking the time to go outside.

60
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,360
Another very good excuse of course is the weather.

61
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,599
It's not a lot of fun to go out if it's cold and pouring with rain.

62
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,240
Well, a very wise person once said that there's no such thing as the wrong weather,

63
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,680
just the wrong clothing.

64
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,159
True Neil, but you have to have the right clothing in the first place,

65
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:20,400
and if the weather's terrible, you might not be able to get good pictures for your Instagram account.

66
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,280
There might not be Instagrammable.

67
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,120
Now, you're not going to find that word in the dictionary, but you probably know that the suffix

68
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:36,240
Abel means possible. So put Abel on the end of Instagram and you get Instagrammable.

69
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,519
And that brings us neatly back to our question.

70
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,599
What percentage of people in the survey said that they wouldn't go out in the country

71
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:46,719
because they wouldn't get good pictures for social media?

72
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:50,799
Was it around 10%, 30% or 50% or did you say Catherine?

73
00:04:50,799 --> 00:04:51,839
I said 10.

74
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,599
And the answer was about 30.

75
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:55,599
What is the world coming to?

76
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:59,839
I don't know what the world's coming to, but we are coming to the end of the program.

77
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,240
So time to review today's vocabulary.

78
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,519
We started off with to venture out somewhere,

79
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:10,639
which means simply to go out somewhere, but usually when the conditions are bad.

80
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,000
For example, it was pouring with rain, but I still decided to venture out to the shops.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,159
We heard about millennials and generation X. Different age groups.

82
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:24,879
Millennials are those who became adults in the early 21st century.

83
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:30,719
And generation X are from the previous generation who became adults in the 1980s and 90s.

84
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,480
Something phenomenal is amazing, surprising and unbelievable.

85
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,120
And then we had distractions for activities that prevent us from doing more important things.

86
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,880
And one of the biggest distractions is social media.

87
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,440
Put the suffix abble onto the end of the name of a social media platform

88
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,680
and you create a word that describes something that's suitable for posting.

89
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,520
So, Instagrammable.

90
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,160
BBC Learning English is certainly Instagrammable,

91
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,520
Facebookable, Twitterble and YouTubeable.

92
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,040
You can find us on all of those platforms as well as on our website.

93
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,200
So do check us out there before joining us again for more 6 Minute English.

94
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,680
Goodbye.

95
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,240
Goodbye.
