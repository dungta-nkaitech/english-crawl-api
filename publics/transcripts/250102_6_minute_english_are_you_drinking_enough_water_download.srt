00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,480
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Phil.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,760
And I'm Beth. Nowadays, I often see people carrying water bottles with them to make sure they drink enough.

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,400
How much water do you drink a day, Phil?

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,480
Oh, I don't know. Maybe about a litre.

6
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,399
Okay. And do you know how much water you should drink a day?

7
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,679
I think it's probably about two litres.

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:42,560
Well, the number many people have heard is two litres a day. Of course, everyone needs to drink some water.

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:49,840
Over half the human body is made up of it. But exactly how much water do we need to stay healthy?

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,120
That's what we'll be discussing in this programme along with some useful new vocabulary as well.

11
00:00:55,119 --> 00:01:00,719
And speaking of vocabulary, remember you can download all the new words and phrases from this programme.

14
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,200
Great. But first, I have a question for you, Phil.

15
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:19,680
I mentioned that over half the human body consists of water. But there's an even higher percentage of water in our blood.

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,960
But how much is our blood A around 80% water?

17
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,720
B around 90% water? Or C 100% water?

18
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,240
I think it's around 80% water.

19
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,320
Okay. I will reveal the correct answer later in the programme.

20
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,080
Our blood needs water so it can carry nutrients to the body's cells and organs.

21
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,760
The amount recommended is often given as two litres a day.

22
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,640
But why? Here to discuss this with BBC World Service programme,

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,480
the food chain is a biologist, Professor John Speakman.

24
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:03,359
So I'm not sure how it was arrived at, but it seems to be a number that has taken grip on a very large number of countries.

25
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,400
So if you look at government recommendations around the world, they're pretty much all the same.

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,719
They're pretty much all the same. Everybody's got to be drinking two litres of water.

27
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:19,199
Professor Speakman doesn't know how the number of two litres a day was arrived at,

28
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:26,879
how it was decided or calculated. Nevertheless, the idea of drinking two litres a day has taken grip

29
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,639
on many governments around the world. When you say an idea has taken grip on something,

30
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:34,960
you mean it's taken control of it?

31
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:41,280
Yes, Professor Speakman says that pretty much all governments are giving pretty much the same

32
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,719
recommendation. He uses the phrase pretty much to mean almost. For example, pretty much all

33
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:54,240
governments advise drinking two litres a day means almost all governments advise it.

34
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:00,000
What Professor Speakman doesn't have, however, is any scientific evidence for this advice.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,280
The number of exactly two litres isn't based on scientific fact. It's more of a ballpark figure.

36
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,759
A number which is a guess, but which you still believe is approximately correct.

37
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,879
Actually, the amount of water in our bodies is changing all the time.

38
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,960
Like your bank balance, which goes down when you spend money, your body loses water all the time

39
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:29,840
when you breathe, sweat or go to the toilet. Exactly how much you need to drink depends on how much water

40
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,680
your body needs to replace, and that mainly depends on your size.

41
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:41,599
But what happens when we drink less than we should? Here's hydration expert Dr Nidio Rodriguez Sanchez

42
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,200
describing the effects of dehydration to BBC World Services, the food chain.

43
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,560
And also many times we start getting dehydrated and we don't realize we are dehydrated,

44
00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:00,480
so it's very common that we feel tired or we feel like we're a bit of a headache or even we

45
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,639
think we are hungry and we go and get some food and naturally what is happening is that we are

46
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:10,799
thirsty, that we are dehydrated, we're starting to show some signs or some symptoms of dehydration.

47
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:17,839
Dr Sanchez describes the effect of dehydration, the condition of not having enough water in your

48
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:25,199
body so that you feel ill or weak. She mentions feeling tired, having a headache or a dry mouth

49
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,680
as symptoms of dehydration, symptoms are signs or feelings in the body showing the presence

50
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,800
of some illness or condition. So whether you drink a little more or a little less, it seems that

51
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,319
around two litres of water a day is a good way to keep your blood and body healthy.

52
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:50,719
Speaking of which Phil, it's time to reveal the answer to my question. What percentage of our

53
00:04:50,720 --> 00:05:01,920
blood is water? You said 80% and the answer is 90% our blood consists of around 90% water.

54
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,880
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've used, starting with the phrase to arrive at a number,

55
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:16,000
meaning to decide it by doing calculations. If an idea takes grip on something, it takes control

56
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:24,480
of it. The phrase pretty much means almost. For example, pretty much everyone likes chocolate,

57
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,720
which means almost everyone likes chocolate. A ballpark figure is a phrase meaning a number which

58
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:38,319
is an acceptably accurate approximation. Dehydration is the condition of not having enough water in

59
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:46,480
your body so that you feel ill or weak. And finally, a symptom is a sign or feeling in the body

60
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:53,199
showing the presence of an illness or condition. Once again, our six minutes are up. Why not join
