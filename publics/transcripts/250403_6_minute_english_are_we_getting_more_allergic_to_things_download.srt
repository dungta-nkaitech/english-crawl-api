2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,439
Hello and welcome to 6-Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Beth.

3
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,199
And I'm Neil. In this episode we're talking about allergies.

4
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:23,280
Allergies are when a certain food or material makes you feel sick. Do you have any allergies, Beth?

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, so I am actually allergic to dairy, so I can't have anything with milk.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,280
So no cheese, no butter. What about you, Neil? Have you got any allergies?

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,799
Well, I'm not great with dairy either, but it's not an allergy, more of an intolerant.

8
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:43,039
So it just makes me feel a bit bad rather than actually making me sick.

9
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:50,240
But I do have hay fever, so I'm allergic to pollen. That means in the summer months I'm sneezing

10
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,840
and coughing all the time. I get runny eyes and a runny nose. And it also gives me a little bit of

11
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,760
asthma, so it's a bit of a pain. Oh yeah, that sounds really horrible.

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,560
Now, scientific evidence shows that more people are developing allergies.

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,359
In this programme we're going to find out about what it's like living with an allergy

14
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,719
and where in the world has the highest rate of allergies.

15
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,159
But first I have a question for you, Beth. What is the most common allergy in the world?

16
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,320
Is it A, peanuts, B, pollen or C, dairy?

17
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,199
I'm going to say pollen. A lot of people I know have hay fever.

18
00:01:27,199 --> 00:01:30,559
Including me. Well, we'll find out the answer at the end of the show.

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,280
Now, Beth, you're allergic to dairy, but imagine if you had over 50 allergies.

20
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,959
That's the situation for Mia Silvaman, who runs a social media account, allergies with Mia,

21
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,839
where she talks about living with lots of allergies.

22
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:51,439
Like the 50 plus allergies include onlets and their oils, I'm allergic to all fish except for

23
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:59,120
cooked tuna and cooked cod fish. Life for Mia involves a lot of planning, as she told BBC World

24
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,959
Service programme What in the World. And having these 50 plus allergies impact my life

25
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,639
every single day. So when it comes to going to restaurants, having to call ahead of time,

26
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,280
talk to the manager, talk to the chef, make sure that the restaurant can accommodate me,

27
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,560
that they can make me something safe and use protocols to prevent any sort of risk of any

28
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,120
allergens touching my dish. When it comes to socialising, it can be kind of hard sometimes,

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,080
because I want to put my friends, don't feel inconvenienced or feel like I'm being a burden.

30
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,719
If Mia wants to go to a restaurant, she has to call ahead of time to tell them about her allergies.

31
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:39,280
If you call ahead of time, you phone somewhere, like a restaurant, before you go.

32
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,280
We can also say call ahead.

33
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,719
Mia needs to find out whether restaurants can accommodate her allergies.

34
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,879
A commentate in this context means give someone what they need.

35
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,000
Because Mia has so many allergies, she has to visit restaurants which have protocols

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,199
to stop the food she is allergic to touching her meal.

37
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,960
Protocols means a set of rules for a process to make sure things are done properly.

38
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,680
Now most people who have allergies don't have as many as Mia,

39
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,360
but scientists believe more people are developing allergies.

40
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,200
And there is one place where the number of allergies is particularly high, Australia.

41
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,960
In fact, Australia is called the Allergy Capital of the World.

42
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,280
When we describe somewhere as the capital of the world in something,

43
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,600
we mean that it's known for that thing.

44
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,080
So the Allergy Capital of the World is the place in the world with the most allergies.

45
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,880
BBC journalist Francis now is from Australia and explains some of the allergy data to BBC

46
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,439
World Service podcast What in the World?

47
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,359
You're from Australia which has been called the Allergy Capital of the World.

48
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:52,000
What is it about Australia in particular that is making people more allergic?

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,240
Australia has turned the allergy capital of the world because due to the research and the data,

50
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,599
that shows that almost one in ten infants have marked a allergy.

51
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,359
And often that's a food allergy or a respiratory allergy.

52
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:08,159
And that does drop off once they're a bit older.

53
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,520
Age 6 or so it goes down to about 6% and then as an adult it goes down to like 3%.

54
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,519
Francis talks about the high numbers of Australian infants,

55
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,759
that's babies, who have allergies.

56
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,920
But she says the numbers drop off as children get older.

57
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,839
If numbers or rates of something drop off, they get lower.

58
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:33,120
By age 6 or so, Australian children are less likely to have allergies.

59
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,240
We can use or so in informal speech to show that the number is an estimate.

60
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,680
It's not exact.

61
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,439
So Beth is there anything we can do about all these allergies?

62
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,000
Well, scientists are investigating giving babies Vitamin D,

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,639
which can be shown to reduce allergies.

64
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,519
Another technique is immunotherapy, which involves scientists giving children

65
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:00,319
tiny amounts of the thing they are allergic to and then building up their baby's tolerance.

66
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,519
Interesting.

67
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,719
And I think it's time to find out the answer to my question.

68
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:08,079
I asked you, what is the most common allergy in the world?

69
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,079
I said pollen, was I right?

70
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,240
You were right, well done.

71
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,959
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned starting with

72
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:21,839
Call ahead of time, which means to phone somewhere like a restaurant before your

73
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,079
appointment or before you go there.

74
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:27,120
If you accommodate someone, you give them what they need.

75
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,360
Protocols are strict rules for how something is done.

76
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,600
If somewhere is the capital of the world for a particular thing,

77
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,199
it's known for that thing.

78
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,280
For example, London is sometimes called the theatre capital of the world

79
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,120
because we have lots of theatres.

80
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,840
If numbers drop off, it means they get lower.

81
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,000
And we can add or so to a number in informal speech to show that the number is an estimate.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,360
It's not exact.

83
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:55,759
Once again, our six minutes are up.

84
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,120
But you can test your knowledge even more using the interactive quiz on our website.

86
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,560
Bye for now.

87
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,040
Bye.
