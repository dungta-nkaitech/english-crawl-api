Hello, this is 6 minutes English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,160
And I'm Neil. On Saturday mornings, I love going to watch football in the park.

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,839
The problem is, when it's cold and rainy, I look out the bedroom window and go straight back to bed.

5
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:32,000
Well, instead of going to the park, why not bring the park to you?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,880
Imagine watching a live version of the football match at home in the warm with friends.

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,679
Sound good, Sam? Hmm, sounds great. But how can I be in two places at once?

8
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,200
Is there some amazing invention to do that? Yeah, it might be, Sam.

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,039
And it could be happening sooner than you think. Thanks to developments in VR or virtual reality.

10
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,079
According to Facebook, Boss Mark Zuckerberg, in the future, will all spend much of our time

11
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,719
living and working in the Metaverse, a series of virtual worlds.

12
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:06,079
Virtual reality is a topic we've discussed before in 6 minutes English,

13
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:12,400
but when Facebook announced that it was hiring 10,000 new workers to develop VR for the Metaverse,

14
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,400
we thought it was time for another look.

15
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,120
In this programme, we'll be hearing two different opinions on the Metaverse and how it might shape

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:25,759
the future. But first, I have a question for you, Neil. According to a 2021 survey by Gaming

17
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:32,800
Company Thrive Analytics, what percentage of people who try virtual reality once want to try it

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:43,280
again? Is it a 9%, b 49%, or c 79%. I guess with VR, you either love it or hate it.

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,600
So I'll say b 49% of people want to try it again.

20
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,719
Okay, I'll reveal the correct answer later in the programme.

21
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,519
But what Neil said is true, people tend to either love virtual reality or hate it.

22
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:03,039
Somebody who loves it is Emma Riddestad, CEO of Warpin, a company which develops VR technology.

23
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,000
Here she is telling BBC World Service programme tech,

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,159
tend her vision of the future.

25
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,120
In 10 years, everything that you do on your phone today, you will do in 3D.

26
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,599
Through your glasses, for example, you will be able to do your shopping,

27
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,000
you will be able to meet your friends, you will be able to work remotely with

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,479
whomever you want, you will be able to share digital spaces,

29
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:33,599
share music, share art, share projects in digital spaces between each other.

30
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,240
And you will also be able to integrate the digital objects in your physical world,

31
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,919
making the world much more digital than it is today.

32
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:49,599
Virtual reality creates 3D or 3-dimensional experiences where objects have the 3 dimensions

33
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:56,479
of length, width and height. This makes them look life like and solid, not too dimensional and flat.

34
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:03,199
Emma says that in the future, VR will mix digital objects and physical objects to create exciting

35
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:08,560
new experiences, like staying at home to watch the same football match that is simultaneously

36
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,640
happening in the park. She blends the words physical and digital to make a new word describing

37
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,879
this combination. Figital. But while a digital future sounds like paradise to some,

38
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,920
others are more skeptical. They doubt that VR will come true or be useful.

39
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,680
One such skeptic is technology innovator Dr. Nicola Millard. For one thing, she doesn't like

40
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,680
wearing a VR headset, the heavy helmet and glasses that create virtual reality for the wearer,

41
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,200
something she explained to the BBC World Services tech tent.

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
There are some basic things that we need to think about. So how do we access it?

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,319
So the reason that social networks took off was we got mobile technologies that let us use it.

44
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:59,439
Now, obviously one of the barriers can be that VR or AR headsets. So VR, I've always been slightly

45
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:06,240
skeptical about, I called it vomiting reality for a while because frankly, I usually need a bucket

46
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,120
somewhere close if you've got a headset on me and also do I want to spend vast amounts of time

47
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,079
in those rather unwieldy headsets. Now, I know they're talking AR as well and obviously that doesn't

48
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,199
not necessarily need a headset, but I think that we're seeing some quite immersive environments

49
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,680
coming out at the moment as well. Nicola called VR vomissy reality because wearing a headset makes

50
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:34,800
her feel sick, maybe because it's so unwieldy, difficult to move or wear because it's big and heavy.

51
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:42,000
She also makes a distinction between VR, virtual reality and AR, which stands for augmented reality.

52
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,000
Tech, which adds to the ordinary physical world by projecting virtual words, pictures and

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,920
characters, usually by wearing glasses or with a mobile phone. While virtual reality replaces

54
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:02,080
what you hear and see, augmented reality adds to it. Both VR and AR are immersive experiences.

55
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,519
They stimulate your senses and surround you so that you feel completely involved in the experience.

56
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,000
In fact, the experience feels so real that people keep coming back for more.

57
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,919
Right, so in my question, I asked Neil how many people who try VR for the first time want to try

58
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:25,199
it again? I guessed it was about half 49%. Was I right? You were wrong, number three. The correct

59
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,759
answer is much higher. 79% of people would give VR another try. I suppose because the

60
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:38,560
experience was so immersive, stimulating, surrounding and realistic. Okay, Sam, let's recap the other

61
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,879
vocabulary from this program on the Metaverse, a kind of augmented reality, reality which is

62
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:51,839
enhanced or added to by technology. 3D objects have three dimensions, making them appear real and solid.

63
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:57,599
Figital is an invented word which combines the features of physical and digital worlds.

64
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,760
A skeptical person is doubtful about something. And finally, unwieldy means difficult to move or

65
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:09,920
carry because it's so big and heavy. That's our six minutes up in this reality anyway. See you in

66
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,120
the Metaverse soon. Goodbye.
