Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

3
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:25,839
And I'm Rob. Now, on Friday the 29th of June 1975, movie posters appeared in cinemas all over

4
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:32,960
the USA with the now notorious words you'll never go in the water again. So, do you know which movie

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,600
was being promoted, Sam? Yes, I think it was George, Steven Spielberg's infamous horror movie,

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,600
which terrified a generation with its story of a man eating great white shark with a taste for

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,439
revenge and for human flesh. George multiplied people's fascination with and fear of sharks.

8
00:00:54,159 --> 00:01:01,359
But sharks' fearsome reputation is not based on facts. Most attacks on humans are cases of

9
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:08,159
mistaken identity, where the shark mistakes a swimmer for fish. In recent years, the average

10
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,879
annual number of worldwide deaths from shark bites was as low as four. Today, sharks should be the

11
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:21,680
apex predators of the ocean, the top predator that hunts and eats other animals but has no natural

12
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,720
predator of its own. Instead, over 100 million sharks are caught and killed each year,

13
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,200
and thanks to this overfishing, many shark species are now endangered. We'll hear more soon,

14
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,520
but first I have a question for you, Rob. Approximately, how many different species of shark

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:50,800
exist today? Is it A, 330, B, 530 or C, 730?

16
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,519
Will I take a guess at B, 530? Okay, I'll reveal the correct answer later in the program.

17
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,200
Now, as Sam mentioned, jaws made many people nervous about swimming in the sea,

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,039
largely thanks to scenes in the movie showing the shark biting swimmers in a frenzy of teeth and

19
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:16,000
blood. George Burgess has spent 40 years studying the cause of shark attacks in his job as director

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,639
of the Florida program for shark research. According to him, the movie's depiction of great whites

21
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:28,080
is totally unrealistic as he told BBC World Service Program, The Inquiry.

22
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,719
Well, a single shark that's involved in a bite on a human, be more likely to bite another human

23
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:40,639
in the future. In other words, is there something of the jaw's image as we saw, unfortunately,

24
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,479
of which you had a white shark that apparently had a grudge and would try to go after a

25
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,879
human, or nothing could be farther from the truth than that? In the movie, sharks

26
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,399
operate as vengeful creatures who recognize and try to kill individual people.

27
00:02:56,399 --> 00:03:02,879
The shark in jaws had a grudge, a feeling of anger or hatred towards someone because of what

28
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:09,199
they did in the past. According to marine biologist George Burgess, this is nothing like the real

29
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:15,759
behavior of sharks in the wild. He says nothing could be further from the truth, an expression

30
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:22,000
used to emphasise that something is not true at all. The actual truth is that sharks have been

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,079
perfectly designed by evolution for their ocean environment. In fact, they have hardly changed

32
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:33,919
over the last 400 million years, making them even older than the dinosaurs.

33
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:41,839
Sharks' characteristic design, their thin teeth and skin, allows them to thrive in their natural

34
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:48,159
environment. Listen to Oliver Krimman, senior curator at London's Natural History Museum,

35
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,399
explaining more to BBC World Service programme, The Inquiry.

36
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:57,359
If we look at the really successful features of sharks, you've got to consider this

37
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:03,759
cartolegionous skeleton. That's no bone in the skeleton. That flexible material that the skeleton

38
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:11,519
is made of enables sharks to be very agile and it enables them to be athletic and it's like weight.

39
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:19,279
Sharks skeletons are made of cartolegge, not bone. Cartolegge is a strong flexible tissue

40
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,719
which connects joints in the bodies of living creatures. Feel for the boning material in the

41
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:30,879
fold of your ear. That's cartolegge. Not having bones allows sharks to be both flexible,

42
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,879
able to bend without breaking and agile, able to move their body quickly and easily.

43
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:43,759
Boneless, bendy and built for speed, sharks really are the perfect evolutionary design.

44
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:50,800
Yet overfishing and the crawl practice of thinning, cutting off shark fins to make exotic soups

45
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,399
and returning the wounded creature to the sea to die, are threatening shark numbers.

46
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,199
Which is why it's tragic that so many of their species are facing extinction.

47
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,839
And speaking of shark species, what was the answer to your question, Sam?

48
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:11,439
Hmm, in my quiz question, I asked how many species of shark there are in existence?

49
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,599
Yeah, and I guess it was around 530 different species.

50
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:21,839
Which was the correct answer, Rob. And the variety of shark species is incredible,

51
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,799
from giants like the great white to the tiny dwarf lantern shark.

52
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:33,599
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from this program all about sharks, the ocean's apex predator.

53
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:39,039
That's the top predator that hunts other animals but has no predators of its own.

54
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:45,599
If you hold a grudge, you have feelings of anger towards someone because of something they did in the past.

55
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:51,679
The phrase nothing could be further from the truth is used to emphasize that something is totally

56
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:58,879
false. Cutledge is the strong flexible tissue connecting bones or joints in the body.

57
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,000
Flexible means able to bend without breaking.

58
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,879
And finally, if you're agile, you can move your body quickly and easily.

59
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,079
Hmm, so once again our six minutes are over.

60
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,879
Bye for now.

61
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,360
Goodbye.
