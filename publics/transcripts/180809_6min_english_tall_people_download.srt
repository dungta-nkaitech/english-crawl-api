5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,960
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,240
And I'm Catherine.

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,559
Catherine, are you tall enough?

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,080
Tall enough for what?

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,240
Tall enough to be happy with your height.

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,080
Oh well, yes, I'm alright with my height.

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,920
I can't do a thing about it anyway.

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,359
So how about you?

13
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:28,960
Well, the same really.

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,000
I wouldn't mind being a slightly taller, I suppose,

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,759
which is appropriate as today's topic is about heightism.

16
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,439
Hightism. Now you may not have heard of heightism before,

17
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:44,079
but it's like other isms, like racism, sexism, ageism,

18
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,200
and other isms that highlight a particular kind of discrimination

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,159
or unequal treatment that people experience.

20
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:55,200
But before we find out more about this topic,

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,960
our quiz question for today.

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,880
The tallest person ever proven to live was Robert Wodlow from the USA,

23
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,159
but how tall was he?

24
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,079
Was he A, 2 metres 71 centimetres?

25
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,560
B, 2 metres 72?

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,439
Or C, 2 metres 73?

27
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:14,640
What do you think, Catherine?

28
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,760
Wow, that's really, really tall.

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,120
I'm going to guess 2 metres 71.

30
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,920
Well, listen out for the answer at the end of the programme.

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,960
Tanya S. Osensky is an attorney and author of the book Short Changed

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,840
about her own experiences of heightism.

33
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,000
Clever title.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,320
To short change someone is to not give them what they're entitled to,

35
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,200
what they deserve.

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,960
And originally this phrase comes from paying for something and not getting the right money back.

37
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,799
So if I buy something for £6 and I pay with a £10 note and the shopkeeper only gives me

38
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,840
£3 back, I've been short-changed.

39
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,039
It means I've been cheated.

40
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,239
And in the context of facing discrimination because you're not tall,

41
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,399
short-changed is a really good pun.

42
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:07,280
Tanya spoke about her book on the BBC Radio programme thinking allowed.

43
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,719
She talks first about our general feelings about height.

44
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,120
What does she say people never wish for?

45
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,519
Everybody that I've spoken to who is tall relishes their height.

46
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,640
I have not met anybody who said they would wish they were shorter.

47
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,560
And people generally tend to even embellish what their height is when you ask them what it is.

48
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,000
So what is it she says no one wishes for?

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,480
Well, she says no one wishes they were shorter.

50
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,160
And that's right, she said that tall people relish their height.

51
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,080
This means they enjoy being tall, they get great satisfaction from it.

52
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,879
And another point she makes is that many people embellish their height if asked.

53
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,079
This means they say they're taller than they actually are.

54
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:57,280
Now to embellish a fact means to exaggerate it to make it seem bigger,

55
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,759
faster, better and so on.

56
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:02,000
Here is Tanya Esersinski again.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,400
Everybody that I've spoken to who is tall relishes their height.

58
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,599
I have not met anybody who said they would wish they were shorter.

59
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,439
And people generally tend to even embellish what their height is when they when you ask them what it is.

60
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:24,879
She goes on to explain how some research has shown that shorter people are less likely to get jobs,

61
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,120
less likely to get promoted and less likely to earn as much as taller people.

62
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,719
What is the financial difference she mentions?

63
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,199
She talks about the premium per inch.

64
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:41,120
An inch is about 2.5 centimeters and the premium is a word which means the extra benefit the extra

65
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,079
advantage.

66
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,840
Here's Tanya Esersinski again.

67
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:51,520
One set of data showed that the premium for height is over $2,000 per inch for men

68
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,560
and $1,000 per inch for women.

69
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,120
And over time that disparity grows significantly.

70
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,960
So it ends up being a huge chunk of someone's paycheck over their career.

71
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,520
She says that taller men earn $2,000 an inch.

72
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,680
For women it's a bit less but still significant at $1,000 an inch.

73
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,960
And this disparity or difference between the salaries of taller and shorter people is an example

74
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,000
of heightism.

75
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,720
shorter people she says are getting fewer jobs and fewer benefits because they're short.

76
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,040
Well one person who certainly wasn't short with the subject of today's quiz question,

77
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,000
the tallest person who has lived Robert Wodlow.

78
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:43,680
We asked how tall he was. Was it a two meters 71 centimeters,

79
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,199
b two meters 72 centimeters or c two meters 73 centimeters.

80
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,240
What did you say Catherine?

81
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,560
I said two meters 71.

82
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
Well you were almost there.

83
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,240
The correct answer was b two meters 72.

84
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,079
Congratulations if you got that right.

85
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:04,800
Now Catherine much as I relish being in the studio with you we must wrap up the program now

86
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,120
with a review of today's vocabulary.

87
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,840
Well relish was one of those words.

88
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,720
If you relish something you really enjoy it.

89
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,079
So thanks for that Neil.

90
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,040
You're welcome.

91
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,160
This program was about a kind of discrimination.

92
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,639
This means the unfair or unequal treatment of people because of, for example,

93
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,399
their race, religion, color, age or indeed height.

94
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,199
And discrimination because of someone's height is called heightism.

95
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,240
Something which many of us do is embellish our height.

96
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,160
We say we are taller than we actually are.

97
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,040
A premium is an extra benefit or advantage that can be gained in this case by being taller.

98
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,200
And finally we had disparity, another word for difference.

99
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,240
There's a disparity between salaries of told people and their shorter colleagues.

100
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,680
And that is six minute English for today.

101
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,160
Do join us again and until then we look forward to seeing you in all the usual places.

Bye.
