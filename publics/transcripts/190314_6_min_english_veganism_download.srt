Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,280
I'm Dan.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,879
Enjoying me is Rob.

6
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:17,839
Hello.

7
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,039
Here at BBC Learning English, we're always discussing diets.

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,760
Hmm, I am on a seafood diet.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,160
When I see food, I just have to eat it.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,839
I suppose there's no chance of converting you to a vegan diet, is there?

11
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:33,119
That seems to be the most talked about food fad at the moment.

12
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,039
A fad is something that is popular, but only for a short time.

13
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:42,159
Of course, veganism, that's not eating or using any products that come from animals,

14
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,840
may be more than a fad.

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,519
It could be a lifestyle that improves our health and the planet,

16
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:49,039
and it could be here to stay.

17
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,240
But personally, me becoming a vegan would take some persuading, I'm sure it would.

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,439
And in this programme, we'll be discussing the debate about veganism

19
00:00:57,519 --> 00:01:00,559
and how it's sometimes difficult to change people's minds.

20
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,879
But first, a question to answer.

21
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:08,879
We've mentioned what a vegan eats, but what about a lacto-ovogetarian?

22
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,840
Which one of these items can they eat?

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,840
Is it a pork, b fish, or c cheese?

24
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,959
I'll say b, they can eat fish.

25
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:22,159
Well, you'll have to wait until the end of the programme to find out.

26
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,920
But now, back to veganism.

27
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:32,159
According to some national surveys, there are now around 3.5 million full-time vegans in the UK,

28
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,680
and the number is growing.

29
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,960
And what was recently a radical lifestyle choice is slowly moving into the mainstream,

30
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,320
or has become accepted by most people as normal.

31
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,680
Advocates of veganism say their healthy lifestyle would also free up space and resources for

32
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,920
growing food, and it would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,200
But come on, Dan.

34
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,799
Having a meat-free diet means you might not get all the nutrients you need.

35
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,200
Well, this is all part of the debate, Rob.

36
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,879
There's always two sides to an argument, and it's something that's been discussed

37
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,840
on BBC Radio 4's Farming Today programme.

38
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,439
They spoke to Dr. Yuta Tobias Mortlach, a senior lecturer in Organizational Psychology

39
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:17,360
at London City University, who explained why views about veganism are so polarised.

40
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,439
That means causing people to divide into two groups with opposing views.

41
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,639
This issue touches on personal beliefs, and beliefs always trump facts.

42
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,759
And so often, when we talk about beliefs, we're touching on important values.

43
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:36,639
Values are the things that guide our opinion over what's right versus what's wrong.

44
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,639
And so whenever people argue over whether it's right or wrong to eat meat,

45
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,279
they are in fact not debating the facts around this issue.

46
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:47,759
They're actually debating the beliefs about what's moral, or immoral about this.

47
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,599
So it seems, in the whole debate about veganism,

48
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,599
we are basing our views on beliefs. A belief is something we feel is true or real.

49
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,479
Our beliefs are based on our values. Those are the things we think are right and wrong.

50
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,759
And when we argue over the rights and wrongs of veganism,

51
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,039
we base it on our values, not hard facts.

52
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,599
We talk about our view on what is immoral,

53
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,959
so what society thinks is wrong or not acceptable.

54
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,519
But basically, there is no right or wrong answer.

55
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,519
That's why we need facts, Rob.

56
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,640
So Dan, what can I do if I want to win you over to becoming an omnivore like me?

57
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,040
According to Dr. Yutte, there are two main routes to winning someone over.

58
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,200
A direct, fact-based approach, or a peripheral route, which might be more effective.

59
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Let's hear her explain how it works.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,760
If I'm working with you and trying to get you to come round to my side,

61
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,960
I might not focus on the central facts.

62
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,920
I might focus on the peripheral stuff around how I'm constructing my argument.

63
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,600
I'd look for ways of how they overlap as people, like what do they have in common?

64
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,680
And that's a way to debate an issue such as this controversial one

65
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,560
in a way to get people to feel connected to each other

66
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,360
and to actually feel that they value each other as decent human beings.

67
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,719
Interesting. This is a more subtle way of winning an argument.

68
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,359
She says we should focus on the peripheral stuff.

69
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:20,240
These are the things that are not as important as the main argument but are connected to it.

70
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,120
So we could say we're looking for common ground.

71
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,639
Things that both sides agree on, or at least understand.

72
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,920
Dr. Yutte talked about making both sides feel connected.

73
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,279
And it's a good point.

74
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,519
Even if you don't want to be a vegan, you should respect someone's choice to be one.

75
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,600
Yes, it's all about valuing someone as a decent human being.

76
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,520
Decent means good and having good moral standards, like us, then.

77
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,360
Well, their wise words, Rob.

78
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,680
Of course, it would be morally wrong.

79
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,120
Immoral. Not to give you the answer to our quiz question.

80
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,400
Earlier, I asked which one of these items can a lacto-over-vegetarian eat?

81
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,920
I said be fish.

82
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,320
Sorry, no. That's something they can't eat.

83
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,560
But they can eat cheese.

84
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,240
A lacto-over-vegetarian is a person who eats vegetables, eggs, and dairy products.

85
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,240
But does not eat meat.

86
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,280
No meat?

87
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,360
No steak. How can they enjoy eating?

88
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,079
Rob, remember as decent human beings, we respect all views here.

89
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,959
Just joking.

90
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:26,000
But now I'm deadly serious about reviewing some of the vocabulary we've discussed today.

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,959
Okay.

92
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,120
Our first word was fad.

93
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,639
A fad is something that's popular, but only for a short time.

94
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,439
Next, we mentioned mainstream.

95
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,759
Something that is mainstream has become accepted by most people as normal.

96
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,919
Then we had polarised.

97
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,439
That describes a situation that causes people to divide into two groups with opposing views.

98
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,560
A belief is something we feel is true or real.

99
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,959
And immoral describes something that society thinks is wrong or not acceptable.

100
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:00,560
We also mentioned peripheral, which relates to things that are not as important as the main argument,

101
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,000
but are connected to it.

102
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,039
It also means situated on the edge.

103
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,560
And finally, decent means good or good enough.

104
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,759
