00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,879
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:19,199
And I'm Sam. How are you, Neil?

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,760
Oh, I've been as busy as a bee this week, Sam.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,879
Ah, don't you sound like the bees knees.

8
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:27,760
All right, Sam. There's no need to get a bee in your bonnet.

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,120
As you can hear, English is full of idioms involving bees.

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,840
Hmm, but the sad truth is that bee numbers are declining at an alarming rate

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,400
and in some places disappearing altogether.

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,560
And this has serious consequences for humans.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:50,960
Today, one third of the food we eat depends on insects to pollinate crops, fruit and vegetables.

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,160
But bees are in trouble. In some European countries, up to half of all

15
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:02,000
bee species are facing extinction, placing our food supply chain at risk.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,200
Bees are vital in pollinating hundreds of crops from apples and blackberries to cucumbers.

17
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:12,640
In fact, almost all plants need insects to reproduce, which is my quiz question.

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,920
Of the world's top 50 crops, how many rely on insect pollination?

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,959
Is it a 35 out of 50, b 40 out of 50 or c 45 out of 50?

20
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:32,639
I reckon those busy bees pollinate b 40 out of 50 of the most common crops.

21
00:01:32,639 --> 00:01:35,199
Okay, Sam, we'll find out the answer later.

22
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:39,519
Now, if you think back to your school biology lessons, you may remember that

23
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:44,719
plants and flowers contain both male and female reproductive parts inside.

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,359
But what exactly is going on when bees pollinate a plant?

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,840
Here's Claire Bates from the BBC World Service Programme People Fixing the World to remind us.

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,159
What is pollination? All flowering plants need it to reproduce.

27
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,719
Pollin is moved from the male part of a flower to the female part of a flower.

28
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,319
Then fertilization can happen, causing fruit to grow.

29
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,039
Some staple crops, such as wheat, rice and corn, are pollinated by the wind.

30
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,519
However, many plants don't release their pollen easily, and this is where insects,

31
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:21,519
and especially bees come in.

32
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,719
As they collect nectar to eat, pollen sticks to them, and they carry it from flower to flower.

33
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,959
Pollination is the process in which pollen is taken from one plant to another,

34
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,319
so that it can reproduce.

35
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,399
This is the important work done by bees and insects.

36
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:41,840
Only after pollination can the next process occur.

37
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,360
Fertilization. When the pollen carried from another plant,

38
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,719
fertilizes a female of you to make new seeds.

39
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,039
Fertilization occurs in all flowering plants, some of which, like wheat, potatoes and rice,

40
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:02,719
are staple crops. Food that is eaten in large amounts as part of a community's daily diet

41
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,400
and provides a large fraction of their energy and nutrient needs.

42
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:14,159
Fewer bees reduces pollination levels, meaning fewer new seeds are created and fewer crops grown.

43
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,920
But it isn't just the decline in bee numbers causing a problem.

44
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:24,879
Like us, bees need to rest, and this has led some to come up with creative new ways of supplementing

45
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,080
bee pollination.

46
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,080
One such innovator is Karen Memran, co-founder of AgroTech Company ADDET.

47
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:38,320
Here she is explaining how dropping pollen from drones can pollinate crops,

48
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,120
giving a helping hand to hardworking bees.

49
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:50,560
How come our food security is so much dependent on an insect that we cannot really control.

50
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,840
We can bring the bees to the orchard or to a field, but we cannot control their behavior.

51
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,439
They do not come out of the hive when it's raining or when there's heavy wind.

52
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:08,000
They work only during daytime. There must be a possibility of developing a mechanical

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,719
solution to the pollination challenge.

54
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,439
Karen Memran, there, speaking on the BBC World Service program, people fixing the world.

55
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:23,519
Bees behavior can't be controlled. When it rains, they won't leave their hive. That's the structure

56
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,680
where bees live, either built by people or made by the bees themselves.

57
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,680
So Karen's company has developed drones to drop pollen on her orchard,

58
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,879
an area of land on which fruit trees are grown.

59
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,879
The need for these high-tech solutions reflects the seriousness of the pollination problem for

60
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:49,040
food security. Everyone getting enough affordable and nutritious food to meet their daily

61
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:56,560
dietary needs. I had no idea bees were so important, Neil. Maybe I underestimated how hard they

62
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,759
work. Ah, you mean today's quiz question. I asked how many of the top 50 world crops rely on

63
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,759
insect pollination? Ah, and I said, be, foresee out of 50 of the top crops.

64
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,680
And you were right. They certainly are the bees' knees when it comes to pollinating plants.

65
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,800
So in today's program, we've been hearing about the important role bees play in pollination.

66
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,720
Transferring pollen from plant to plant, necessary for the next stage of fertilization,

67
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,400
producing new seeds and fruit inside a plant.

68
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,680
Bees and insects play a vital role in growing the world's staple crops.

69
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,720
Food, which eat an enlarge amount, makes up the majority of a community's daily diet

70
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,840
and meets their nutrient needs. So bee numbers are directly linked to the issue of food security.

71
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:55,519
Everyone getting enough affordable, nutritious food to meet their dietary needs.

72
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:01,759
Which explains why when bees won't leave their home or hive, some people have started using drones

73
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:08,079
to pollinate their orchards, land-growing fruit trees. And that's it for this edition of 6 Minute

74
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,319
English. Bye for now. Goodbye.
