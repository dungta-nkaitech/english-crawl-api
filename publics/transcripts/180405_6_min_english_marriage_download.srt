From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,199
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,240
And I'm Rob.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,160
Now Rob, can you complete this saying?

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,960
Love and marriage go together like...

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,240
Love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage.

10
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:32,159
That's right. And when was the last time you saw a horse and carriage?

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,359
Well, that would have been quite a while ago.

12
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,039
They're quite rare these days, not on everyday sight.

13
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,719
Indeed. And according to recent statistics,

14
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,079
marriage in the UK is getting rarer too.

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,039
Not as rare as seeing a horse and carriage, but the numbers are falling.

16
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:52,640
Before we look at this topic in a bit more detail, a little quiz for our listeners.

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,640
Yes. According to the UK's Office for National Statistics,

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,640
how many opposite sex marriages were there in 2015?

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:08,799
Was it A, 239,000, B, 309,000, or C, 339,000? Any idea, Neil?

20
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,079
Mmm. I have no idea, but I'm going to have a guess and I'm going to say...

21
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,519
A, 239,000.

22
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,040
Okay. Well, we'll reveal the answer a little later in this programme.

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,319
And whatever the correct number, the trend is downwards.

24
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,799
Year on year, there are fewer opposite sex couples getting married in the UK.

25
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,199
So, why might this be? Are we falling out of love with marriage?

26
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:36,319
Let's hear from a couple of people with different views.

27
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,879
First, here's Tom from BBC Learning English.

28
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,199
What doesn't he like about the idea or concept of getting married?

29
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:48,799
I'm not that enthusiastic about the idea of marriage to tell you the truth.

30
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,799
I think it's a bit of an archaic concept these days.

31
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,359
And I'm a bit of a commitment fob.

32
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,759
I don't like the idea of signing a piece of paper that says I have to be with someone

33
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,879
for the rest of my life and can never escape from that person, I suppose.

34
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,240
Although, I am in a very happy relationship at the moment.

35
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,680
So that was Tom there, not a fan of marriage, but what were his objections, Neil?

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,439
Well, he described marriage as an archaic concept.

37
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,079
When someone describes something as archaic, they think it is very old-fashioned.

38
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,280
Out of date, belonging to a different time.

39
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,920
So that was one of his problems with marriage.

40
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,040
But he also said that he was a commitment fob.

41
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,040
The suffix fob means someone who is afraid of something.

42
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,400
In some cases, it can also be used as a standalone word,

43
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,760
but it means the same.

44
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,480
So a commitment fob is someone who is afraid of

45
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,960
or doesn't like the idea of commitment.

46
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,120
And when talking about relationships,

47
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,920
commitment means being with one person and giving up the idea of being free

48
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,839
to do whatever you want and see whoever you want romantically.

49
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:59,519
So for commitment fobs, commitment means losing something.

50
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,039
But that's not true for everyone.

51
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:03,599
Here's Dan also from BBC Learning English.

52
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,279
What's his view of marriage?

53
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:06,719
In general, I think it's quite good.

54
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,439
It has a very stabilizing effect on society.

55
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,799
And it declares publicly to the world that

56
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,519
you have found the right person for you

57
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,599
and that you're in a committed relationship.

58
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,280
So Dan is a fan.

59
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,120
He thinks marriage has a stabilizing effect on society.

60
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,079
He sees marriage as being good for society as a whole.

61
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:30,799
It makes society stronger, more stable.

62
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,680
And he also sees it as a way to say to everyone

63
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,599
that you have a strong relationship.

64
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,759
You're with the one person you love.

65
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,919
So for Dan, commitment and being in a committed relationship

66
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,639
is a good thing.

67
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,759
Now back to our question at the top of the program.

68
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,519
I asked how many opposite sex couples got married in the UK?

69
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,879
In 2015.

70
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,960
And I took a guess, didn't I?

71
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,919
And I said,

72
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:56,560
A, 239,000.

73
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,439
Am I right?

74
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,879
You are definitely right.

75
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,680
The answer is 239,000.

76
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,120
Or 239,020 to be precise.

77
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,359
That figure was 3.4% lower than 2014.

78
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:12,240
So what do relationship experts think is the reason

79
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,840
fewer people are getting married?

80
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,599
Well, there could be lots of reasons.

81
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,639
In some countries, the way society is changing

82
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,000
means that there is less pressure to get married or stay married.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,240
As a result, there are more divorces.

84
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,639
So perhaps children of divorce parents are less likely to get married themselves.

85
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,800
Right, well, before we go,

86
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,839
let's recap the vocabulary we highlighted today.

87
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,839
The first word was trend.

88
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,599
A trend is the direction that something is changing over time.

89
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:43,120
When it comes to marriage, the trend is for fewer marriages.

90
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,599
And the trend for six minute listeners is the opposite,

91
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:48,319
going up, particularly when you're presenting Neil.

92
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,759
That's very nice of you.

93
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,879
You're very kind.

94
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,240
The next two words were an archaic concept.

95
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,399
archaic is an adjective for something dated or old-fashioned.

96
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:00,240
A bit like your fashion sense.

97
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,959
Oh, Rob, just as I was beginning to like you.

98
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,360
Sorry about that. You know I don't mean it.

99
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,680
In the interview, archaic was used to describe the concept of marriage,

100
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,199
not your fashion sense.

101
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,159
Concept is another word for an idea or belief.

102
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:17,519
So an archaic concept is an old-fashioned idea.

103
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:20,639
Our next expression was commitment fob.

104
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,079
We use this phrase to talk about someone who's scared of the idea

105
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,759
of a long-term relationship,

106
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,560
because they see it as giving up some freedoms.

107
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,639
You're obviously a complement fob.

108
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,719
You're afraid of saying nice things about someone,

109
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:35,519
so you always have to say something nasty as well, eh?

110
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,560
Well, I said I was sorry.

111
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,719
And finally, we had the adjective stabilizing.

112
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:43,120
Something that is stable is strong,

113
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,120
and something that makes something strong

114
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,279
can be described as stabilizing.

115
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:52,239
Dan expressed his belief that marriage had a stabilizing effect on society.

116
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:53,919
