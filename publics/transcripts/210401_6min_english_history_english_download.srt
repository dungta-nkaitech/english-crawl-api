6-Mate English from BBCLearningEnglish.com

3
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,199
Hello, this is 6-Mini English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,719
And I'm Georgina.

5
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:19,760
Gordon Amedian.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,600
Melee Cupfeat on Metinet.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,359
I beg your pardon, Neil.

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,519
It's something stuck in your throat.

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,679
Are you speaking a foreign language?

10
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:33,119
Ha, well, actually Georgina, I was saying good morning, please to meet you in English.

11
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,280
But not the English you and I speak.

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,000
That was Anglo-Saxon or Old English.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,399
The earliest form of English spoken in the Middle Ages, so between the 5th and 15th century.

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,200
It doesn't sound anything like the way people talk nowadays.

15
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,039
No, but it's surprising how many of the words we use today have survived from Old English.

16
00:00:53,119 --> 00:01:00,240
Beer, wine, drink, fish, bread, butter, eye, ear, mouth, head, hand, foot,

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,439
life, love, laughter, mother, daughter, sister, brother, son, father,

18
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,519
all Anglo-Saxon words.

19
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,000
Wow, so many everyday words.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,879
But what about the classics Latin and Greek?

21
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,439
I thought a lot of English vocabulary came from there.

22
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,359
That's also true.

23
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,400
But the history of English is the history of invasions.

24
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,440
You know, when the army of one country fights to enter and control another country.

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,520
Like the Roman invasion of Britain?

26
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,520
Right. And later invasions too, by Norse speaking Vikings and Germanic Saxons.

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,640
In fact, Georgina, that reminds me of my quiz question.

28
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,280
Go on then, but in modern English, if you don't mind.

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay, well, the year 1066 is remembered for a famous battle.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,640
When the French-speaking Norman King, William the Conqueror, invaded England.

31
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,840
But what is the name of the famous battle?

32
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,560
Is it A, the Battle of Waterloo?

33
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,480
B, the Battle of Hastings?

34
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,480
Or C, the Battle of Trafalgar?

35
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,760
Mmm, my history is not great now, but I think it's B, the Battle of Hastings.

36
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,879
Okay, Georgina will find out later another old English word there.

37
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,000
But it's not just words that survive from Anglo-Saxon.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's word endings too.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,400
The suffix, or letters added to the end of a word, to modify its meaning.

40
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,439
Right, like adding S to make something plural,

41
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:27,360
as in one bird, two birds, or the nest in goodness and happiness and

42
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,159
Dom as in freedom and kingdom.

43
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,360
Poet Michael Rosen is fascinated by Old English.

44
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,879
Here he is talking about word suffixes to Oxford University Professor Andy Orchard

45
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,840
for BBC Radio 4's programme Word of Mouth.

46
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,920
Listen out for the proportion of modern English that comes from Anglo-Saxon.

47
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,000
I walked that, walked a bit on the end.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,119
Yeah, the E.D. ending, most modern verbs, if we would say, you know, I texted my daughter.

49
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:57,279
I mean, text is obviously comes from Latin.

50
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:58,479
I tweeted.

51
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,119
We still laps to the Anglo-Saxon.

52
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:05,119
And generally, when I'm speaking, just let's do it in mathematical terms.

53
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:08,799
What proportion can we say is Old English?

54
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,039
Can we say like about 80% in common parlance,

55
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,719
sorry to use a French word there?

56
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:16,400
In speech, it will be something like that,

57
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,159
in the written language less.

58
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,199
So the basic building blocks of who we are and what we think.

59
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:29,199
Professor Orchard estimates that 80% have spoken English in common parlance comes from Anglo-Saxon.

60
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:34,479
In common parlance means the words and vocabulary that most people use in ordinary,

61
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,239
everyday conversation.

62
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,840
So Anglo-Saxon words are the building blocks of English.

63
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,120
The basic parts are put together to make something.

64
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,520
He also thinks that the languages we speak shape the way we see the world.

65
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:54,240
Here's Michael Rosen and Professor Andy Orchard discussing this idea on BBC Radio 4 program,

66
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,120
Word of Math.

67
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,199
Can we say that English speakers today, as I'm speaking to you now,

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,199
view the world through Anglo-Saxon eyes through Anglo-Saxon words? Can we say that?

69
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,960
Well, certainly in Old English poetry, it's always raining and I suppose it's always raining today.

70
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,400
There is a retrospective element that we're still inhabiting that worldview,

71
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,720
those ideas, the same words, the same simple ideas that they inhabited.

72
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,639
And what's extraordinary if you think about the history of English is despite the

73
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,280
invasions by the Norse and by the Normand, and then despite the years of empire where we're bringing

74
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,199
things back, the English that we're speaking today is still at its root, Old English word,

75
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,920
at its heart, Old English word, still very much English.

76
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,080
Michael Rosen asks if English speakers see the world through Anglo-Saxon eyes.

77
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,680
When we see something through someone's eyes, we see it from their perspective, their point of view.

78
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,439
And Professor Orchard replies by saying that despite all the history of invasion and empire,

79
00:04:53,439 --> 00:05:00,879
the English we speak today is still Old English at heart. A phrase used to say what something is really like.

80
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:07,040
Wow, so much history crammed into six minutes, and now time for one more history fact.

81
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,480
Do you mean your quiz question, Neil? What's the name of the famous battle of 1066?

82
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,800
What did you say, Georgina?

83
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,120
I said be the Battle of Hastings.

84
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:23,920
Which was the correct answer? The Battle of Hastings in 1066 played a big part in the Norman

85
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,680
Conquest and mixing French words into the language.

86
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,120
And I also know how the English ruler King Harold died, shot through the eye with an arrow.

87
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,439
Ouch. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary, some of which exists because of invasions,

88
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,319
when one country enters and controls another.

89
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,920
A suffix is added to the end of a word to make a new word.

90
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,399
The phrase in common parlance means using ordinary everyday words.

91
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,360
Building blocks are the basic parts used to make something.

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,240
To see things through someone's eyes means from their point of view.

93
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,879
And finally, at heart is used to say what something is really like.

94
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,280
That's all for this program. Join us again soon at six minute English, but for now.

95
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,439
Fargazand, that's Old English for goodbye. Fargazand.
