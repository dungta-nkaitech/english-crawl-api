From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,960
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Rob.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,240
And I'm Dan.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,480
Hey Dan, what's the time?

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,120
Time you got a new watch?

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,120
Now I didn't ask you that just for a joke or a sarcastic comment now, did I?

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,839
Well, no, but look, there's a clock over there.

11
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:31,440
And you are wearing a watch.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,359
You have a smartphone and a computer, all of which show the time.

13
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:37,519
So why are you asking me?

14
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:40,640
Oh, Dan, I was trying to introduce today's topic,

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,240
which is all about virtual assistants or bots.

16
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,000
You've seen to have forgotten the script.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,240
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

18
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,719
We're talking about software that you talk to and that can talk back to you.

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,519
Like Apple's Siri, Google's Assistant,

20
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:59,200
Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana.

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,680
It might be on your phone or computer or even a speaker in your house.

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,040
Now before we hear more about this topic,

23
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,640
here is today's quiz question.

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,159
Do you know when was the first computer which could recognise speech launched?

25
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:20,320
Was it in a 1951, be 1961 or C 1971?

26
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,200
Oh, I found my script.

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
So I've seen the answer.

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,120
But I have to say, I was surprised.

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,480
OK, don't tell anybody, Dan.

30
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,240
OK, we'll give the answer for the listeners at the end of the program.

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,680
We're going to hear now from Tom Hewitson,

32
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,400
who is a conversation designer working in the field of virtual assistants,

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,920
talking on BBC Radio 4's Word of Mouth program.

34
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,920
He talks about the whole idea of virtual assistants

35
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,200
and how they're changing the way we interact with technology.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,920
How does he describe our existing relationship with computers?

37
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,320
It changes the way that we think about computers.

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,200
To date, we've thought of them largely as tools.

39
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,000
They're just an advanced version of a calculator.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,800
There's something that you kind of use to get a specific thing done.

41
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,479
Whereas this is kind of changing the more into like an agent.

42
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,479
They're an active participant in the kind of interaction

43
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,439
and in guiding you to make the right decision.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,280
How do he describe our existing relationship with computers then?

45
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,840
He said that to date, which is an expression which means up until this point in time,

46
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,400
we've thought of them as advanced calculators.

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,439
Yes, that's right.

48
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,000
We use them as a tool to get things done.

49
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,800
But he says that modern technology is turning them into an agent.

50
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,759
This doesn't mean a secret agent like James Bond.

51
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,520
In this sense, an agent is something that has agency

52
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,879
and that means it has the ability to act individually

53
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,479
and make its own decisions.

54
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:53,359
I'm not sure I'd like my phone to have agency.

55
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:55,759
It probably wouldn't like being in my pocket all day.

56
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,280
Hmm, it would, Dan.

57
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,000
But I'm not sure Huitson is suggesting our devices will become that clever.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,519
But he did say they could become more active in our lives.

59
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,879
Hmm, maybe.

60
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,599
Oh, I imagine, for example, telling us if we're spending too much time

61
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,879
in fast food restaurants.

62
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,639
Maybe in your case, Dan.

63
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,239
Mine will be telling me I spend too much time in the gym.

64
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,439
Huitson goes on to explain how the way we talk

65
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,000
to our virtual assistants will develop.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,879
What does he say we don't need to do?

67
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,280
We will develop our own kind of vernacular for speaking with machines

68
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,080
that will be subtly different from how we speak to other people

69
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,080
because as you rightly point out,

70
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,920
you don't need to make the machine like you.

71
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,719
You don't need to kind of make random chitchat that's just filling the time.

72
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:45,520
It can be much more brusquen to the point.

73
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,680
A lot of what we say in human communication is to do with our relationship

74
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,280
with the person we're talking to.

75
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,320
We say things and talk about things that are maybe not directly relevant to our point.

76
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,240
With a digital virtual assistant, we don't need to do that

77
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,200
so we don't need to make the machine like us.

78
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,560
Huitson said that we will develop our own vernacular.

79
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,439
This is a general word for a native language.

80
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,360
This vernacular will be a little bit different from our everyday vernacular

81
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,080
because as we said, we don't need to maintain a social relationship

82
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,680
with the artificial assistant.

83
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,000
This means that we won't need chitchat.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,960
Chitchat is another expression for small talk.

85
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,600
Conversation topics which aren't important,

86
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,720
but are part of everyday social communication

87
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,319
like talking about the weather.

88
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,439
And because we don't need to be friends with our virtual assistants,

89
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,840
we can be brusquen to the point.

90
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,600
Both of these mean being very direct and not very polite.

91
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,760
Well, Dan, I don't mean to be brusqu,

92
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,960
but it is time for the answer to this week's quiz question.

93
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,600
Earlier, I asked, when was the first computer

94
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,920
which could recognise speech launched?

95
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:58,000
The options were A, 1951, B, 1961, and C, 1971.

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,680
Well, actually, the first computer which could recognise speech was launched in 1961.

97
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,879
Yep, it was called the IBM shoebox

98
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,839
and could recognise 16 words and the numbers 0 to 9.

99
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,519
That's nearly as many as you.

100
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,719
Cheeky, right, enough of this chitchat.

101
00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:18,879
Let's recap today's vocabulary.

102
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,719
Well, chitchat was one of today's expressions, meaning small talk,

103
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:25,519
but we also had the expression to date.

104
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,560
That means up until this moment in time.

105
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,480
Then we have the noun agent.

106
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,439
This refers to something that has agency,

107
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,240
and that is the ability to think, make decisions,

108
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,920
and act independently.

109
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,120
The next word is vernacular, another word for language,

110
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,079
particularly when talking about a native language.

111
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,160
And finally, there was brusqu, meaning direct and not polite,

112
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,519
and to the point, which also means direct and without unnecessary information.

113
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,800
Hey, Rob, yes, what can I do for you, Dan?

114
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
In the programme, certainly, Dan.

115
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,360
Well, that's all from us today.
