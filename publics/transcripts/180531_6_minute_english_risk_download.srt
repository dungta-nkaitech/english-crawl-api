From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,839
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,800
I'm Neil and joining me today is Rob.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,800
Hello.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,280
So Rob, what's the most dangerous thing you've ever chosen to do?

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,960
Mmm, tricky question.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,440
I've done many risky things.

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,440
Probably the most risky thing is bungee jumping in New Zealand.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,960
Oh wow, bungee jumping.

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,640
You never catch me doing that.

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,719
Did you enjoy it?

15
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:38,039
Not really, no. I won't do it again.

16
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:45,719
OK, well today our topic is risk and how different people react to different levels of risk in different ways.

17
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,200
For example, would you be happy to be in a driverless car?

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,840
Absolutely not.

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,600
No, I don't trust anybody's driving even a computer.

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,679
So no, I wasn't going to drive a list car.

21
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:58,679
OK, I won't offer you a lift.

22
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:01,800
Driverless cars are the topic of today's quiz.

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,159
The question is when was the first driverless car demonstrated on a public road?

24
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:13,040
Was it A, the 1970s, B, the 1950s or C, the 1920s?

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,000
Well, I think they're quite modern, so I'm going to say 1970s.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,879
OK, well, we'll find out if you're right at the end of the programme.

27
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:27,719
Joe Cable is an associate professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.

28
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:33,239
In a recent BBC science programme all in the mind, he talked about the psychology of risk

29
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:40,399
and whether there was anything physically in our brains that could predict how much risk we are prepared to accept.

30
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:45,159
Here he is, first talking about a number of different ways people see risk,

31
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:47,959
how many different types does he describe.

32
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:53,639
Some people are quite risk averse and really don't want to take any decisions

33
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:55,639
where there's risk involved at all,

34
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:58,199
whereas others are fairly risked home rent,

35
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:59,959
and in some cases even risk seeking.

36
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:05,000
So they seek out decisions that have an aspect of risk to them.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,719
How many different types of people did he mention when it comes to attitudes to risk?

38
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:11,319
Well, there were three.

39
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:14,840
The first group was those who are risk averse.

40
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,039
If you are averse to something, you're against it.

41
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,159
You don't like it.

42
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,360
So risk averse people don't like to take risks.

43
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,319
The second group are those who are risk tolerant.

44
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,520
If you are tolerant of something, you accept it.

45
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,080
You don't mind it. It's not a problem for you.

46
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,599
So someone who is risk tolerant is not worried by an element of risk in what they choose to do.

47
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,360
The third group he mentioned are those who are risk seeking.

48
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,599
If you seek something, you actively look for it.

49
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,359
You try to find it.

50
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:48,479
So risk seekers are those who enjoy risk

51
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,120
and want to take risks in their life.

52
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,959
Associate Professor Cable carried out research on risk taking

53
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,159
and discovered that there were differences in brain structure

54
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,159
and the way parts of the brain work together between those who are risk averse

55
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,039
and those who are risk tolerant or risk seekers.

56
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,560
So it seems as if this is something that could be measured.

57
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,799
You could put someone in a brain scanner

58
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:13,439
and tell if they like risk or not.

59
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,199
I wonder how useful that would be though.

60
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,400
Is there any practical application for this knowledge?

61
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,039
Good question. And one that was put to Cable.

62
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:23,759
What area does he say this could be applied to?

63
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,359
Definitely something that I can see coming out of this

64
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:34,240
is using these associations to help develop better assessments

65
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,439
of who's likely to take risks versus not.

66
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,599
This is exactly the thing that financial advisors want to assess

67
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,519
when you come to them and say,

68
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,919
I want to put my money away for retirement.

69
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,519
Exactly the aspect of your personality that they want to know

70
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,439
is what's your tolerance for taking risks.

71
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,959
In which area does he say knowledge of someone's attitude to risk might be useful?

72
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,120
Financial planning. He says that financial advisors

73
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,319
who are people that give advice on what to do with our money

74
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,639
would find this information very useful.

75
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,000
It would help them to assess what to do with your money,

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
which means it would help them to decide to make an intelligent decision

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,319
about your money in certain situations.

78
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,959
For example, if you're planning for your retirement,

79
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,199
retirement is the time when you are able to or you have to stop working.

80
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,759
He also used an interesting expression there

81
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,279
to put your money away, which means save your money,

82
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,319
put it somewhere where you can't spend it and where it can grow.

83
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,639
You know, I think my financial planner could just ask me about

84
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:40,399
how I feel about risk rather than giving me a brain scan.

85
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:42,000
I hope brain scans can be risky.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,319
Not sure that's true, but anyway,

87
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,519
what is true is the answer to this week's quiz question.

88
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,479
I asked you when the first driverless car was demonstrated on a public road.

89
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:59,120
The options were A, the 1970s, B, the 1950s and C, the 1920s.

90
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,079
What did you say, Rob?

91
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,159
I said the 1970s.

92
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:05,039
And you were wrong, I'm afraid.

93
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,240
Apparently it was the 1920s, so a long time ago.

94
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,640
Well done if you got that right.

95
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,120
Now, before we drive off into the sunset, let's recap today's vocabulary.

96
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,840
Yes, right.

97
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,760
First, we had three words describing different attitudes to risk.

98
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,920
There was risk averse for people who don't like risk.

99
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,879
People who don't mind risk are risk tolerant.

100
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,160
And people who like risk and want risk are risk seekers.

101
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,360
Next, we had the verb to assess.

102
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,960
This means to make a judgment or a decision based on information.

103
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,560
A phrase meaning to save money is to put money away.

104
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,400
And finally, we had retirement.

105
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,680
That time of life when you are too old to work anymore

106
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,199
or you have enough money that you don't need to work anymore.

107
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,120
Are you looking forward to your retirement, Rob?

108
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,920
Oh, cheeky.

109
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,840
I'm neither old enough nor rich enough to even think about that, Neil.

110
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,639
Same here.

111
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,120
Well, that's all from us today.

112
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,240
And you don't have to be a risk seeker to find us on Facebook,

113
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,840
