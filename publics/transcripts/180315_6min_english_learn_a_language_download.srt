From BBC Learning English

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,200
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English,

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,199
the show that brings you an interesting topic,

7
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,800
authentic listening practice,

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,920
and vocabulary to help you improve your language skills.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,879
I'm Rob.

10
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:25,199
What has she known to my or her, Neil, does it?

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,160
And that means...

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,120
My name's Neil.

13
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,199
Ah, Neil. Here's a question for you.

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,759
Can you speak any languages other than English, of course?

15
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:32,560
I think you can.

16
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,240
In Poco, Spanish.

17
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,399
Ah, that means a little bit of Spanish.

18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:36,879
Yeah.

19
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:38,879
Some Japanese, which I tried at the beginning,

20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,920
and also a little bit of Czech language.

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,719
Dobri den.

22
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,920
Ah, the axiomash.

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,439
Yeah, very impressive.

24
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,719
So, what tips can you give for learning to speak another language?

25
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,960
Well, practice, practice, practice.

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,000
And don't be afraid of making mistakes, as I...

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,799
No doubt have.

28
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:55,439
Of course.

29
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,879
Well, my aim this year is to master the Spanish language.

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,800
Master means to learn thoroughly.

31
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,240
My bien.

32
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,600
Well, you're not alone.

33
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,400
A survey by the British Council found learning a language

34
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,359
is a new year's resolution for about one in five Britons in 2018.

35
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,760
So, learning Spanish is a good start, Rob.

36
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,879
But do you know approximately how many languages there are in the world altogether?

37
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,760
Are there A, 70, B, 700, or C, 7000?

38
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,760
Ah, well, I know there are many,

39
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,480
but surely not 7000, so I'm going to say B, 700,

40
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,160
but don't expect me to learn all of them.

41
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,200
I won't, Rob.

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,520
But I will give you the answer later.

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,200
So, we all know learning another language is a good thing.

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,640
It brings us many benefits.

45
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,920
Yes, we can communicate with people from other countries.

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,520
And when we're traveling, we can understand what signs and notices say.

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,960
So, we don't get lost.

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,360
That's right.

49
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,439
But many scientists also believe that knowledge of another language

50
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,280
can boost your brain power.

51
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,480
A study of monolingual and bilingual speakers

52
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,439
suggests speaking two languages can help slow down the brain's decline with age.

53
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,960
All good reasons.

54
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,519
But Neil, learning another language is hard.

55
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,759
It would take me years and years to become fluent in say, Mandarin.

56
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,120
And by fluent, I mean speak very well without difficulty.

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,039
Well, this depends on your mother tongue.

58
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,599
In general, the closer the second language is to the learner's native tongue and culture

59
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,879
in terms of vocabulary, sounds, or sentence structure.

60
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,120
The easier it will be to learn.

61
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,319
But whatever the language, there's so much vocabulary to learn.

62
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,799
You know, thousands and thousands of words.

63
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:33,759
Maybe not, Rob.

64
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,840
Professor Stuart Webb, a linguist from the University of Western Ontario,

65
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,280
may be able to help you.

66
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,240
He spoke to BBC Radio for more or less programme

67
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,400
and explained that you don't need to do that.

68
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,759
For language learners in a foreign language setting,

69
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:55,439
so for example, if you were learning French in Britain or English in Japan,

70
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:04,319
students may often really struggle to learn more than 2,000, 3,000 words after many years of study.

71
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,840
So for example, there was a study in Taiwan recently

72
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,319
that showed that after nine years of study,

73
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,319
about half of the students had still failed to learn the most frequent 1,000 words.

74
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,959
Now, they knew lower frequency words,

75
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,640
but they hadn't mastered those most important words.

76
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,560
So, Rob, don't waste your time trying to learn every single word.

77
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,760
Professor Webb spoke there about research that showed students

78
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,240
new, lower frequency words, but weren't learning enough high frequency words.

79
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,560
Right, and frequency here means the number of times something happens.

80
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,000
So the important words to learn are the high frequency ones.

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,439
And how many are there exactly?

82
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,360
Here's Professor Stuart Webb again.

83
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,520
For example, with English, I would suggest if you learn the 800 most frequent lemmas,

84
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:57,760
which is a word and its inflections, that will account for about 75% of all of the English language.

85
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,400
So that learning those 800 words first will provide the foundation for which you may be able to learn

86
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,240
the lower frequency words.

87
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,560
Fascinating stuff.

88
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,240
And good to know, I just need to learn about 800 words,

89
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,680
or what he calls lemmas.

90
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,600
Yes, a lemma is the simplest form or base form of a word.

91
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,759
And the inflection here refers to how the base word is changed according to its use in a sentence.

92
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,079
Knowing these things gives you a foundation.

93
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:29,519
That's the basics from which your language learning will develop.

94
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,400
Simple.

95
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,840
Thank goodness I am learning just one new language.

96
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,759
But how many languages could you potentially be learning Rob earlier?

97
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,000
I asked you approximately how many languages there are in the world altogether?

98
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,639
Are there A, 70, B, 700 or C, 7000?

99
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,120
And I said 700. Was I right?

100
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,639
No Rob, you were wrong.

101
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,079
There are around 7000 recognised languages in the world.

102
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:59,759
UNESCO has identified two and a half thousand languages, which it claims are at risk of extinction.

103
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,759
A sobering thought Neil.

104
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,240
Now, shall we remind ourselves of some of the English vocabulary we've heard today?

105
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,680
Starting with master.

106
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,519
To master a new skill in this context means to learn thoroughly,

107
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:12,799
or learn well.

108
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:17,599
Rob hopes to master Spanish before he starts a new job in Madrid.

109
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:19,439
Really, that's news to me, Neil.

110
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,120
But it would be good to be fluent in Spanish or any language,

111
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,959
or to speak it fluently.

112
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,919
That speaking it very well and without difficulty.

113
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,240
Now our next word was frequency.

114
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,959
Here we are referring to high and low frequency words.

115
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,199
So it means how often they occur.

116
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,879
Examples of high frequency words are it, the, and and.

117
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,479
And our next word is inflections.

118
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,879
These are the changes to the basic form of words,

119
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,120
according to their function in a sentence,

120
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,479
such as adding an S to the end of a word to make it plural.

121
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,639
And don't forget lemma, which is the simplest form or base form of a word

122
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,479
before an inflection is added.

123
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,959
And finally, foundation, which means the basics you're learning grows from.

124
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,759
That just leaves me to remind you that you can learn English with us

125
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,839
at bbclearningenglish.com.

126
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,519
That's it for today's six minute English.

127
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,479
We hope you enjoyed it.

128
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,439
Bye for now.

129
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:12,479
Nascale da no,

130
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,359
hasta luego,

131
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:14,240
Jane!

132
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,120
And an English.

133
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,599
Goodbye.

134
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:16,079
Goodbye.
