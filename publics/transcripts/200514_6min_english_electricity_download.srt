00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,039
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,400
And I'm Georgina.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,080
How Georgina, what do you know about ACDC?

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,719
You mean the Australian rock and roll band?

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,160
Well, the 1979 hit Highway to Hell

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,800
stayed at number one for 11 weeks.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,000
No, no, no, not that ACDC Georgina.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,079
I'm not talking rock music here. I'm talking electrical currents.

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,320
Alternating current AC

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,240
and direct current DC.

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,039
The two ways in which electricity flows.

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,600
Oh, I see. No, I don't know anything about that ACDC.

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,840
Well, don't worry because in today's programme we'll be finding out some quirky facts about electricity.

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,920
How it differs across the world and why some countries have more complicated electrical systems than others.

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,800
Hmm, I have noticed that when I travel to another country I need a converter plug to connect my laptop.

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,600
Is that something to do with ACDC?

21
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,960
Yes, it could be.

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,800
Of course, electricity itself doesn't change from country to country.

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:24,640
No, it's an invisible natural force at work in everything from lightning storms to the electrical sparks firing in our brains.

24
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,319
But although it happens naturally, one scientist was credited with discovering electricity.

25
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:32,480
Who? That's my quiz question.

26
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,480
Who discovered electricity?

27
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:41,200
Was it A, Thomas Edison, B, Alexander Graham Bell, or C, Benjamin Franklin?

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,280
Hmm, I'm not a qualified electrician myself, Neil, but I'll say C, Benjamin Franklin.

29
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,400
Okay, well, one person who definitely is a qualified electrician is BBC presenter, Gareth Mitchell.

30
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,000
So when BBC Radio 4's science stories sent him to meet electricity expert Keith Bell,

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
the conversation was, shall we say, Sparky?

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,320
Standard Freaks in the US is 60 Hertz.

33
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:12,000
Actually, I think in the US, on the mainland, US main continent, there are three different synchronous areas.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,920
So although it's around 60 Hertz, any moment in time, these three different areas,

35
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,080
because they're not connected to each other, we'll be going at a slightly different frequency.

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,439
There are bigger differences elsewhere.

37
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,400
So in Japan, for example, I think one of the main islands is at 60 Hertz,

38
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,639
and the other half of Japan is at 50 Hertz.

39
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,599
That's a bit of a pickle.

40
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,280
Generally speaking, frequency means how often something repeats.

41
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,960
In the case of electrical currents, frequency is the number of times an electrical wave repeats

42
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,199
a positive to negative cycle.

43
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,120
It's measured in Hertz.

44
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,719
In the US power is at 60 Hertz, and in the UK, it's around 50 Hertz.

45
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,120
So the US and UK are not in the same synchronous area,

46
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,919
not occurring together at the same time and rate, or in this case, frequency.

47
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,800
Which means that to safely use a British electrical device in America,

48
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,120
I need to convert the power supply.

49
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,560
If not, it won't work, or even worse, it could break.

50
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,759
And a broken laptop could leave you in a bit of a pickle,

51
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:19,120
an informal expression, meaning a difficult situation with no obvious answer.

52
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,640
His, Gareth, and Keith again, talking about more differences.

53
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:29,280
I'm pretty sure when I go to the United States, my electric toothbrush

54
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,879
doesn't charge up at 60 Hertz, 110 volts, but my laptop still works.

55
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,280
Maybe you have no comment, Keith, but I'm just saying one of these anomalies that

56
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,080
I seem to have found.

57
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,080
So I'm not sure about the electric toothbrush, but I know a lot of our power supplies for

58
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,960
laptops and stuff are solid state.

59
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,640
You know, they've got electronics in that do all the conversion for you.

60
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,320
So basically it ends up with a DC supply into the machine itself.

61
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,240
So it's a little converter in there and it's designed that it doesn't care what frequency

62
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,439
the AC input is.

63
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,000
Gareth noticed that in the United States, his toothbrush doesn't always fully charge up,

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,719
get the power needed to make it work.

65
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:14,319
Electric toothbrushes which don't fully charge and differences between electrical frequencies

66
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,800
are good examples of anomalies.

67
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,000
Things which are different from what is usual or expected.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,680
But with modern technology, these anomalies are becoming less and less commonplace.

69
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,839
For example, computer companies have started making laptops with solid state electronics.

70
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:37,519
Electronics using semiconductors which have no moving parts and can automatically convert

71
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,279
different electrical currents.

72
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,439
Meaning I can use my laptop to google the answer to your quiz question.

73
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,240
Ah yes, I asked you which scientist was credited with discovering electricity.

74
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,360
And you said,

75
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,439
C Benjamin Franklin and I already know I'm right because I googled it on my solid state laptop.

76
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,920
To show that lightning was electricity, Franklin attached a metal key to a kite and fluid

77
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,480
during a thunderstorm. The key conducted electricity and gave him a shock.

78
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,959
Hmm, not an experiment.

79
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,879
I recommend trying it home.

80
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,519
Today we've been talking about anomalies or unexpected differences in electrical

81
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,879
currents between countries.

82
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,560
Electrical currents are measured in frequencies.

83
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,399
The number of times a wave repeats are positive to negative cycle.

84
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,480
These can be different if two countries are not synchronous,

85
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,399
occurring at the same rate.

86
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:32,879
For example, Britain and the United States.

87
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,920
Different frequencies may mean you're electrical devices like your laptop,

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,120
phone and toothbrush won't properly charge up, get the power to function in other countries.

89
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,520
And having a phone with no power could leave you in a bit of a pickle, a difficult situation.

90
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:56,080
Fortunately, many modern devices use solid state electronics, non-moving semiconductors inside

91
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,759
the machine which automatically convert the electrical current.

92
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,520
So you'll never miss another edition of 6 Minute English again.

93
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,879
That's all for today.

94
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,439
See you soon at BBC Learning English for more interesting topics and related vocabulary.

95
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,319
Goodbye for now.

96
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,120
Bye!
