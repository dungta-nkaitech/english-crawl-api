00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,800
Hello, welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,080
And hello, I'm Rob.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,199
Today we're discussing music and the idea that songs are becoming faster.

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,719
What music do you like, Rob?

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,039
Oh, me, I like rock music.

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,199
It has good vocals and it's loud.

11
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,160
How about you, Neil?

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,240
Well, I like anything and I prefer streaming my music, actually.

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,359
No old-fashioned CDs to buy and load up.

14
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:38,240
It's easier to play and you can play it anywhere.

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,359
And streaming is where you listen or watch music

16
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:44,640
or videos directly from the internet as a continuous stream.

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,799
Did you know that some people believe that streaming music online is actually

18
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,280
changing the songs people write?

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,240
And it might be leading to songs getting faster.

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,079
Well, that's what we're discussing today.

21
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,479
Let's hope it doesn't happen to this programme,

22
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,439
otherwise we might become 3 Minute English.

23
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,679
But before it does, let's get on with our question for everyone to answer.

24
00:01:05,679 --> 00:01:08,799
In 2017, Louise Fonzzi's summer hit,

25
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,479
Despacito, officially became the most stream song of all time.

26
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,480
Do you know approximately how many times it was streamed?

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,079
Is it A, 1.6 billion times, B, 3.6 billion times,

28
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:25,359
or C, 4.6 billion times?

29
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,760
I know the song was popular, but 4.6 billion sounds too big,

30
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,799
so I'll go for A, 1.6 billion.

31
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,200
OK, well, we'll find out later in the programme.

32
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,879
But now back to our discussion about how music producers are adapting

33
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,959
their songs for modern technology.

34
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,480
Researchers have found long instrumental introductions to pop songs

35
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,560
have become almost extinct.

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,000
Of course, the aim of many pop songs is to be enjoyed by many to be popular,

37
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,879
but they also need to be a commercial success.

38
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,079
They need to make money.

39
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,239
Brendan Williams, a music producer and professor of music technology,

40
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,120
can explain what he thinks influences the songs.

41
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,960
Here he is speaking on BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme.

42
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,719
I think that, you know, one of the things that's driving this,

43
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:12,960
there are a number of things.

44
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,159
They're all radio, they're all singles designed for radio playlists.

45
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,360
Radio playlists are extremely important factors in judging the success of a track

46
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,400
and obviously do feed into the kind of commercial success of a track.

47
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,360
So he mentions that radio playlists are important factors.

48
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,200
A playlist is a list of songs that a radio station plans to play,

49
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,160
and he says that radio playlists affect the commercial success of a song.

50
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,560
By the way, he called a song a track.

51
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
That's a recorded piece of music.

52
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,640
And notice how he used the word driving,

53
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,200
which means having a strong influence.

54
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,160
So getting a song played on the radio is important,

55
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,240
and it has to be made in a way that will suit the radio station's playlist.

56
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,359
Now, we know there are thousands of songs out there to listen to,

57
00:02:57,359 --> 00:02:59,519
and plenty of ways to listen to them.

58
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,240
So how can record companies get someone to listen to their particular song?

59
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,199
Well, have a listen to Brendan Williams again to see what he thinks.

60
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,759
But then there's the influence of streaming services like Spotify,

61
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,800
where if a track isn't played for at least 30 seconds,

62
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,240
then it doesn't register a play.

63
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,280
And if we don't hear the vocals, then we might not carry on listening.

64
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,240
Absolutely, yeah.

65
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,800
Yeah, that's the theory is to get through, I guess,

66
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,319
to get into the meat of the song,

67
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,280
to hear the lyrical content and get through to that first chorus.

68
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,680
Well, it seems songs no longer have an intro,

69
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,520
the instrumental piece of music that's played before the singing begins.

70
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,360
In the old days, radio DJs,

71
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,639
disjockeys who played the records love to talk over that bit.

72
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,920
Now we need to get to the lyrical content.

73
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,759
That's the lyrics or the words to the song as soon as possible.

74
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:53,519
So the theory or idea is to present listeners with vocals and a chorus more quickly,

75
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,679
as it will make them want to continue listening.

76
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:59,199
That's because if a song isn't streamed for more than 30 seconds,

77
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,199
it doesn't register a play.

78
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,919
It doesn't get measured or recorded as a play,

79
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,120
so it doesn't make money.

80
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,039
So a song needs to hook the listener in quickly.

81
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:13,120
In other words, it needs to attract their attention and be easy to remember.

82
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
Another word for this is catchy.

83
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,039
Do you have any favourite catchy songs, Rob?

84
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,439
Oh, I do, I do. It's got to be happy by For Elle Williams, very catchy song.

85
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,920
Well, something that is always catchy in this programme is our quiz question.

86
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,080
Earlier I mentioned that in 2017, Luis Fonzzi's summer hit,

87
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,000
Despacito, officially became the most streamed song of all time.

88
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,759
Did you know approximately how many times it was streamed?

89
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:46,080
Was it A1.6 billion times, B3.6 billion times, or C4.6 billion times?

90
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,439
And I went for a staggering 1.6 billion times.

91
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:51,120
Well, it's not staggering enough, Rob.

92
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,279
It was actually streamed 4.6 billion times.

93
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,240
Amazing.

94
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,519
That's a number that we can only dream of for this programme.

95
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,079
Or is it?

96
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,919
Well, Neil, shall we download to our memory some of the vocabulary we've learnt today?

97
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,680
Streaming describes the activity of listening to or watching music,

98
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,759
radio or videos directly from the internet as a continuous stream.

99
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,920
Something that is a commercial success is popular and makes lots of money,

100
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
like a new computer game or pop song.

101
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,360
A good pop song, Rob.

102
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,920
Not something annoying like Gangnam style.

103
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,839
Oh, well, that was a huge commercial success because it was catchy.

104
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:31,839
A word that describes something that attracts attention and is easy to remember.

105
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,360
We also mentioned a playlist.

106
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,319
That's a list of songs that are radio station plans to play.

107
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,159
And we also use the same word, playlist, to describe a list of songs you compile yourself

108
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,439
on a streaming service.

109
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,920
We also heard the adjective driving, which in the context of our discussion

110
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,920
means having a strong influence.

111
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,560
And we mentioned the verb to register.

112
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,079
If you register something, you record, count or measure it.

113
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,039
Like every download of this programme is registered.

114
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,120
But how do we download this programme, Rob?

115
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,560
