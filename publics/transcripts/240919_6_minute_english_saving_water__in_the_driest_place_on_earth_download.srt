00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,160
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Neil

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,359
And I'm Beth

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:17,120
We all know how horrible it feels to be thirsty

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,640
Human bodies need around 3 litres of water a day

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,480
And thankfully most of us can just turn on the kitchen tap to get clean drinking water

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,600
But globally over 2 billion people around a quarter of the world's population live in water

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,159
stressed countries where access to water for drinking, cooking and washing is not guaranteed

10
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:45,760
What's more, water is also needed to grow food and that's getting harder due to droughts

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,000
which are increasing with climate change

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,240
In this programme we'll visit farmers in one of the driest places on earth, Yuma in the USA

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:00,880
where a new technology involving liquid clay is helping farmers grow fruit and vegetables in the desert

14
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,799
And as usual we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary too

15
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,079
But first I have a question for you Neil

16
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,240
Everyone knows that plants need sunlight and water to grow

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,040
but soil is just as important

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,159
One of the most useful soils is clay, a dense, smooth soil which is very fertile but sticky

19
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,399
Clay has been used in agriculture for thousands of years

20
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:28,799
But what is its more modern use?

21
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,439
Is clay good for a. Curing headaches, b. Digesting food or c.

22
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,879
Smoothing face skin

23
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,239
Well I think clay can be used to smooth the skin on people's faces

24
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,319
Okay Neil, we'll find out if that's the correct answer later

25
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,919
Lack of water and farming are closely connected

26
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:56,159
Agriculture uses a massive 70% of the world's fresh water supply

27
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,599
so ways to use water more efficiently are much needed

28
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:05,919
Oles-Sivitzen's company Desert Control works with date farmers in Yuma

29
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:09,120
an area on the border of California and Mexico

30
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:16,240
One of the hottest places on earth, Yuma has been experiencing its worst drought in 500 years

31
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,079
forcing farmers to pump water from rivers to grow their date palm trees

32
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:26,079
Fortunately, Oles team have created a liquid that they say

33
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:30,799
can turn the sandy desert soil into a sponge which holds water and nutrients

34
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,639
Here he explains his invention to Anthony Wallace

35
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,799
reporter for BBC World Service program People Fixing the World

36
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,159
To understand how it works we need to look at the difference between sandy soil and clay soil

37
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,520
sandy desert soil has a lot of gaps in it

38
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,560
so water drains through it quickly making it harder for plants to establish a root system in the ground

39
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,199
but clay soil is made up of much smaller particles that cling together and naturally stop water from escaping

40
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:05,439
It creates the habitat for the soil microbiology to also start to develop and evolve

41
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,359
so it's kind of a kickstart as well to nature's natural processes

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,760
The problem with sandy soil is that it drains water

43
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,120
if you drain something you remove the liquid from it

44
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,600
Clay soil on the other hand is made of smaller particles which cling or stick together tightly

45
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,160
and hold water helping plants grow

46
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,520
Oles makes a liquid by mixing clay and water which changes the soil composition

47
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,640
and kick starts the growth of his trees

48
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,840
the liquid makes the trees start growing more quickly

49
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,200
liquid clay technology is still new and costing around $2,000 an acre

50
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,520
it's not cheap but Oles claims his technique halves the amount of water needed to grow fruit trees

51
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,599
and that most farmers will make back their investment within two years

52
00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:00,560
Oles claims sound too good to be true but are there downsides to interfering with nature in this way

53
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,960
presenters Myra and Nubi and Anthony Wallace discuss this question for BBC World Services

54
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,400
People Fixing the World

55
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,680
Anthony I'm still left wondering right when you manipulate soil like this

56
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,160
Could you be causing problems down the line?

57
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,800
Yeah I think anytime that there's a new technology where you are like you said

58
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,680
manipulating nature only time will tell what the long term effects of that will be

59
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:33,040
but Oles did stress that their liquid clay does not use any chemicals only clay, air and water

60
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:40,960
Oles liquid clay involves manipulating soil using and controlling it skillfully to achieve some results

61
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:49,200
Myra worries that when people do this they could create problems down the line at some unspecified point in the future

62
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:56,400
In fact only time will tell if liquid clay is a long term solution to the problem of water scarcity

63
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,720
the phrase only time will tell means that the result of something happening now will not be known

64
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,160
until the future something we can know though is the answer to my question Neil

65
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:15,120
Yes you asked about a modern use for clay and I guessed it was for smoothing facial skin

66
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:24,160
Which was the correct answer a clay mask also called a mud pack is used to smooth the skin on your face

67
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt in this programme starting with the verb to drain

68
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,439
which means to remove liquid to cling it means to stick or hold tightly onto something

69
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:40,000
if you kick start something you make it start or develop more quickly

70
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,160
to manipulate means to skillfully use or control something

71
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,839
the phrase down the line means sometime in the future

72
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:53,759
and finally the idiom only time will tell means that the truth about something happening now will

73
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,879
only be known in the future once again our six minutes are up but remember to join us again

74
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:04,719
