00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,919
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Phil.

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:19,199
And I'm Georgie. We all know how important exercise is to stay fit and reduce the risk of heart disease.

4
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,240
Do you exercise much, Phil? I try to. I ride my bike at the weekend.

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,320
But to be honest, I do spend a lot of time sitting down.

6
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,240
Sitting too much is becoming an increasing problem in the modern world.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,280
Maybe you take the bus or train to work, then sit at a desk all day, then go home feeling tired

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,879
and just sit in front of the television all evening as well. Added together, that's hours of

9
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,719
sitting every single day. In this programme, we'll be finding out exactly how much sitting is too

10
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,640
much. And of course, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary. But first, are you sitting

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,799
comfortably, Phil, because I have a question for you? On average, how many hours a day do British

12
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:10,319
adults spend sitting down? Is it A, seven hours, B, nine hours or C, 12 hours?

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,560
I'll guess it's seven hours. Okay, Phil, I'll reveal the correct answer later.

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,400
Charlotte Edwudson is a professor of health and behaviour studies who has investigated the

15
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,960
link between sitting and health problems in her lab at Lester University. Here, she talks to

16
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,880
BBC Radio 4 programme inside health. If we think about our daily activities, a lot of activities

17
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,880
are done sitting down. Movement in our everyday lives has really been engineered out with advances

18
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,280
in technology, and our bodies just weren't designed to sit this much, so it's going to cause problems

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,320
with our health. So when you sit down, you're not using the largest muscles in your body, so these

20
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,679
are the ones in your legs and your bum. So that means that your muscle activity goes down. When your

21
00:01:53,679 --> 00:02:00,559
muscle activity goes down, your blood circulation reduces. Throughout history, humans have always

22
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:07,359
walked and moved their bodies. Now, modern technologies like motorised vehicles and office jobs

23
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:13,519
means we spend more and more time sitting. Modern life has engineered out the need for us to move.

24
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,760
When you engineer something out, you design things in such a way that it is no longer required.

25
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,879
For example, CD drives have been engineered out of laptops because downloads are more popular.

26
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:34,960
Charlotte says humans are not used to sitting this much. Here, the words this much mean in such

27
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:42,240
large amounts. It's a negative thing. One negative being the harm to blood circulation. The flow of

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:48,719
blood through the heart and blood vessels, which carries oxygen around the body. When we sit,

29
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:56,080
we stop using important muscles. This reduces blood circulation and causes a range of other effects,

30
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:03,600
like increased levels of glucose and fat and decreased energy levels. The body uses 20% more

31
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:11,520
energy when simply standing than when sitting down and walking uses 92% more energy. And that's not

32
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,400
to mention the damage sitting too much causes to muscle movement and blood pressure.

33
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:23,760
But the hard truth is that sitting is a big part of modern life. Everything is geared around sitting.

34
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,640
It's organised towards that particular activity. And that makes it hard to stop.

35
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,400
Here's Professor Ed Woodson again talking with James Gallagher, presenter of BBC Radio 4 program

36
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,039
Inside Health. How much do you feel like you're just swimming against the tide with all of this?

37
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:47,680
The whole of society is driving as more and more towards sitting down all the time. And you're like,

38
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:55,599
please don't. Sitting is so much part of our everyday activities. You go into a meeting and

39
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,080
someone's come and take a seat. You go into your GP surgery, come and take a seat. Everything's

40
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,120
geared around sitting. And as technology advances and it tries to make our life easier,

41
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,960
it then leads to a sitting even more. James asks if Charlotte is swimming against the tide of

42
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:16,639
modern life. If you're swimming against the tide, you're doing the opposite of what most people

43
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:23,280
are doing. He also says that society is driving us towards sitting more. To drive someone

44
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,680
towards something means pushing them to accept a new situation even when the situation isn't so good.

45
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,840
Luckily, there's some simple advice to help. Break up periods of sitting 30 minutes or more with

46
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,400
a few minutes of walking or moving your arms. Also, try to spend less than half of your waking hours

47
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,360
sitting down. Good to know. Now, about your question, Georgie.

48
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,199
Right. My question was how long does the average British adult spend sitting each day?

49
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:00,879
Phil guessed it was seven hours, which was close, but not right, I'm afraid. In fact, on average,

50
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:08,879
we spend nine hours per day sitting down. That's about 60% of our waking life. So remember to take

51
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:15,360
regular breaks even just a minute or two. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned. Starting

52
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,800
with to engineer something out, meaning to design or plan in such a way that something is no longer

53
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,920
needed. The phrase this much or so much means in such large amounts. Blood circulation is the

54
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,040
movement of blood through the heart and blood vessels which carries oxygen around the body.

55
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:41,040
If things are geared around a certain activity or purpose, they're organized to support it.

56
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,960
The idiom to swim against the tide means to not follow what most people are doing.

57
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:53,599
And finally, to drive someone towards a new situation means to push them towards accepting it.

58
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,719
Once again, our six minutes are up. Remember to join us again next time for more

59
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:04,799
