00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,359
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,240
And I'm Neil.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,679
The BBC's 100 Women's Season is back this week.

7
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:22,400
It will explore women's stories of defiance

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,000
and it will include stories of women who inspired us.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,080
And that's what we're going to talk about today.

10
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:30,239
And which woman has inspired you, Alice?

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,280
Oh well, I have many female role models.

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,439
And this means people look to by others as examples to be followed.

13
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,879
But I must say I have a great admiration for the suffragettes.

14
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,079
Ah, the women who fought for the right to vote in the UK.

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,679
Yes, I think they were very brave.

16
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,959
Yes, so do I.

17
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:49,599
Let's see how much you know about it, Neil.

18
00:00:49,599 --> 00:00:52,079
This is today's quiz question for you.

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,519
Which was the first country to give all women the right to vote in public elections?

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,760
Was it A, Finland, B, New Zealand, or C, the United States?

21
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,960
Hmm, I am going to say A, Finland.

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,240
Well, we'll see if you were right or not later on in the show.

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,840
Here in Britain, women's groups lobbied or tried to persuade parliament

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,439
for decades before eventually winning the right for all women to vote in 1928.

25
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,359
So why did it take so long?

26
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,439
Because parliament didn't see votes for women as a priority.

27
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,120
Then, 30% of men still didn't have the vote either.

28
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:36,959
And politicians felt they needed to address this before thinking about the woman question as it was known.

29
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,039
The thing is, without the power to vote, it's hard to influence public policy.

30
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:44,400
Politicians are worried about losing popularity with the electorate.

31
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,640
That's the people who are allowed to vote.

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,439
Women had to find a voice, and the suffragette movement gave them a voice.

33
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,719
There were several activists in this movement, but perhaps the most famous was Emmeline Pankhurst.

34
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,039
Emmeline Pankhurst campaigned fearlessly for women's rights for all women.

35
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:05,039
Aristocratic ladies, factory workers, conservatives, socialists.

36
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:11,840
Let's listen to Julia Bush, author of Women Against the Vote, talking more about this suffragette leader.

37
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,400
Well, she was a very charismatic leader, one of the great women of the 19th century,

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,159
and she had a deep compassion for the plight of women.

39
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,719
And in particular, she was fired by the inequalities that women experienced at that time.

40
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,079
It wasn't just about the parliamentary vote.

41
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:40,800
The suffragette movement, she in particular wanted wider reforms for women in improvement in women's

42
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,719
status and position. Author Julia Bush, she talks about the plight of women.

43
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,879
Plight means a bad situation.

44
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,159
Women did have a really hard time back then, especially working class women.

45
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,799
And they had little hope of improving their lives because they had no public voice.

46
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:04,240
So that's what Julia Bush means when she says Mrs. Pankhurst wanted wider reforms,

47
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,759
access to better schools for women to university to better pay jobs and professional careers.

48
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,759
And it was a big challenge to be heard.

49
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:16,800
June Purvis, a meritor's professor of women's and gender history at the University of

50
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Portsmouth here in the UK, talks about how the suffragette started to raise their profile or get

51
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,280
noticed with deeds not words.

52
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,719
You have women interrupting theatre plays, getting thrown out of church services for

53
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:37,280
interrupting, getting thrown out of lion's cornerhouse for standing up on chairs and having

54
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,920
little impromptu meetings. But militancy also takes on other forms. It takes on forms of direct

55
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,719
action, which start with large demonstrations when women will not be time-backed by the police,

56
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,239
and then it moves on in other forms as well to criminal damage.

57
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:58,239
So women started to interrupt public events to talk about their right to vote.

58
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,560
An impromptu meeting is one that hasn't been planned. Lion's cornerhouse was a chain of

59
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:10,079
T-shops popular at the time. You can imagine that women suddenly standing up on chairs and

60
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,440
addressing the public would have been quite shocking in those days. Indeed. The suffragette started

61
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:21,280
small with T-shop talks, but they began to take more militant or aggressive direct action.

62
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,840
And direct action means using demonstrations, strikes. The suffragette's chained themselves to

63
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,520
railings, broke shop windows. It was quite a struggle, and there was no way of delaying the decision

64
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,199
to give women the right to vote. In 1914, war broke out in Europe, and with the men away

65
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,000
fighting many women ran their homes, cared for children and relatives, managed money, and often

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,120
had a job as well. So when the war ended in 1918, women had proved how capable they were in so many

67
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,279
ways to deny that the right to vote now seemed ridiculous. Although it took another 10 years before

68
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:02,240
all women were given the vote on equal terms to men. But come on, Alice, it must be time to hear

69
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,000
the answer to today's quiz question. I asked which was the first country to give all women the

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,639
right to vote in public elections. Was it A, Finland, B, New Zealand, or C, the United States?

71
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:25,279
And I said Finland. Well, no, sorry, Neil. It was B, New Zealand. In 1893, New Zealand became

72
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,360
the first country to give all adult women the right to vote in national elections.

73
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,680
Now, shall we remind ourselves of the words we learned today? Yes, they were. Roll models,

74
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:46,720
suffragettes, lobbied, electorate, plight, raised their profile, impromptu, militant, direct action.

75
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,040
That's the end of today's six-minute English, and we would like to invite you to follow the

76
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:57,040

77
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:03,439

79
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,120
