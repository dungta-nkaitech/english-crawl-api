00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,600
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,120
And I'm Neil.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,120
Have you heard this, Doke Neil?

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,480
Question. What's a rat's favourite game?

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,679
I don't know, Sam. What is a rat's favourite game?

9
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:28,879
Hide and squeak.

10
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:30,879
Very funny.

11
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:35,600
Well, I'm glad you're laughing because, as we'll be finding out in this programme,

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,439
laughter is good for you. In fact, laughter is often called the best medicine.

13
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,159
And it seems that's really true, medically speaking.

14
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,480
Laughing releases anti-stress endorphins into the body,

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,799
and there's evidence that people who laugh recover more quickly from illness,

16
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,000
including Covid.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,280
Laughing is an essential part of what makes us human.

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,120
Babies cry straight from birth, but the next sound they make,

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,480
often as young as two or three months, is laughter.

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,760
And who can hear a baby laugh without laughing themselves?

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,200
Laughter is catching.

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,599
But before we start tickling off any bones, I have a quiz question for you, Neil,

23
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,920
and it's no laughing matter.

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,159
Laughter can be a serious business.

25
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,920
In fact, there's a scientific field of study into laughter and its effects on the human body.

26
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,120
But what is this study called?

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:34,079
Is it A, GIGLOGY, B, GELOTOLOGY or C, GIFOLOGY?

28
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,000
Did you make those words up, Sam?

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,600
They sound a bit funny to me.

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,520
I'll say the study of laughter is called B, GELOTOLOGY.

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,760
Okay, Neil, but you'll be laughing on the other side of your face if you're wrong.

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,320
Anyway, we'll find out the correct answer later in the programme.

33
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,320
Someone who's an expert in the study of laughing, whatever it's called,

34
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,559
is Cognitive Neuroscientists, Professor Sophie Scott.

35
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:00,639
Here she explains to David Edmunds,

36
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:04,079
presenter of BBC World Service programme The Big Idea,

37
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,919
exactly how a laugh is produced.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,240
Laughing is a variation of breathing.

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,759
Like breathing, it involves the ribcage.

40
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:17,919
When you laugh, you get these very, very large,

41
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:21,840
very fast contractions of the ribcage.

42
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,000
And it's a very primitive way of making a sound.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,039
So you're really just squeezing air out in big bouts.

44
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,919
Each of those individual squeezes gives you both a huff sound.

45
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,719
The ha ha sound you make when you laugh comes from your ribcage.

46
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,840
A structure made of bones, called ribs,

47
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,120
in your chest which protects the heart and lungs.

48
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,199
The ribcage works like a drum to amplify a laugh.

49
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,199
It's the reason why jokes are sometimes called rib ticklers.

50
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,359
Professor Scott calls this a very primitive way of making sounds,

51
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:58,879
because it's simple, natural and essentially human.

52
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,280
The word primitive can be used to describe anything relating to the basic way

53
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,639
humans lived at their early stages of development.

54
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:09,439
Before money, machines or writing were invented.

55
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:13,120
Primitive human noises like crying and laughing

56
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,239
linked to a universal human experience.

57
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,879
And this can be seen in the large number of words we use to talk about them.

58
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,000
In English, chuckle, giggle, turtle, cackle and giggle,

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,639
all describe different types of laughter.

60
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,519
Right, so how would you describe a giggle, Sam?

61
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,240
Hmm.

62
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,280
I'd say a giggle is laughing in a quiet but uncontrolled way,

63
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,120
like a child who finds something very funny or feels embarrassed.

64
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,599
Unlike a giggle, which is when you blast out a very loud laugh,

65
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,560
often it's something stupid or rude someone has said.

66
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,080
But humans aren't the only animals to laugh.

67
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,000
We belong to the same family as other primates like chimpanzees,

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,120
gorillas and orangutans, all of whom laugh.

69
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,680
Even rat tickle each other and make squeaky noises like laughter when they play.

70
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,120
Here's Professor Scott again to take up the story for BBC World Service Program,

71
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,080
The Big Idea.

72
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,360
Play's a very important behaviour for mammals,

73
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,879
all mammals play when they're juveniles and some mammals play their whole lives.

74
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,639
And laughter's a sort of an invitation to play to sign that you're playing.

75
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,279
Professor Scott says laughter is an important social tool for all mammals.

76
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:32,399
Animals, including humans, dogs and whales, which give birth to live young,

77
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,920
rather than laying eggs, and who feed their young with milk.

78
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,600
By laughing, young mammals, sometimes called juveniles,

79
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,439
signal that they want to play.

80
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:46,079
And young rats who don't laugh back are more likely to get a bite than a giggle,

81
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:48,719
and a rat bite is nothing to laugh about.

82
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,159
What a lot of facts we've learnt about laughter, Neil.

83
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,959
Yes, we could almost be experts on laughter.

84
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:57,599
Gapologists, isn't that what you called them, sir?

85
00:04:57,599 --> 00:04:58,319
Ah, yes.

86
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,639
In my quiz question, I asked you to name the scientific study of laughter

87
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,639
and its effects on the body.

88
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,319
I'm almost certain it's not gigglogy or gapology,

89
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,799
so the answer must be...

90
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:12,079
Gelatology!

91
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,319
The correct answer, well done, Neil.

92
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,079
I knew you were good for a laugh.

93
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,279
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary from the programme

94
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,680
before you think up any more terrible jokes.

95
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,199
First, we had ribcage, the structure in your chest,

96
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,560
which is made of ribs, and produces the sound of laughter.

97
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,279
The adjective primitive relates to the simple, natural way humans lived

98
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,279
in the early stages of development.

99
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,159
There are different types of laughter, including giggles,

100
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:41,519
childlike laughter, in a quiet but uncontrolled way.

101
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,919
And gaffors, when you laugh out loud, often at something someone has said.

102
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,319
Mammals are animals, including humans,

103
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,839
which give birth to live young and feed them with milk.

104
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:57,120
And finally, a young animal, which is not fully grown, can be called a juvenile.

105
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,879
Well, it's been a laugh a minute, Sam, but unfortunately, our six minutes are up.

106
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:04,159
Join us again soon for more trending topics,

107
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:07,919
useful vocabulary, and who knows, maybe some terrible jokes,

108
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,319
here at six minutes English. Bye for now.

109
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,120
Goodbye.
