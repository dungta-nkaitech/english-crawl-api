Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Rob.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,960
And I'm Sam.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,359
In this program, we'll be unlocking the secrets of the ancient Egyptians,

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,800
Pyramid Builders and the inventors of Hieroglyphs,

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,200
a writing system which uses pictures and symbols to represent words.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,560
The meaning of Egyptian Hieroglyphs remained a mystery until 1799,

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:44,000
when Napoleon soldiers unearthed a dark, damaged rock in the Egyptian coastal town of Rosetta.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,400
On the broken granite stone, three scripts were faintly carved,

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,640
Greek at the bottom, D'Amotic in the middle, and Hieroglyphs at the top.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,160
Today, the Rosetta Stone is perhaps the most famous museum object in the world.

13
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,159
But what's actually written on it is quite dull.

14
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,680
In fact, the Rosetta Stone contains a tax break.

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,560
It describes an agreement exempting priests from paying taxes to the king.

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,200
Ah, the famous Egyptian pharaohs.

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,640
Exactly, but which one, Sam, let's test your ancient Egyptian knowledge with this quiz question.

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,040
The writing on the Rosetta Stone is a tax agreement between the priests

19
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,439
and which Egyptian pharaoh.

20
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,640
Is it a, Cleopatra, B, Ptolemy, or C, Ramases?

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,719
I'll guess a, Cleopatra.

22
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,159
Okay, Sam, I'll reveal the answer to that mystery later on.

23
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,719
Before the discovery of the stone, no scholar had been able to understand the strange symbols carved

24
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:46,240
on the great Pyramids.

25
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,919
Egyptologist Richard Parker was in charge of the Rosetta Stone exhibition at the British

26
00:01:51,919 --> 00:02:01,119
Museum for 20 years. Here he is, telling BBC Radio 4 program in our time about circumstances

27
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,199
before the discovery of the stone.

28
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:10,479
People were exploring all sorts of means of trying to decipher, including trying to link

29
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,680
the script with Chinese to see if that offered a parallel.

30
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,319
It was known from the classical authors that the Egyptian script contained great

31
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,719
mysterious pearls of wisdom from the Egyptian philosophers, and people had hugely high expectations,

32
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,840
and all attempts to decipher to get a grip on the script I think had really failed.

33
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,800
Before the discovery of the Rosetta Stone, no one had managed to decipher hieroglyphs

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,080
to work out the meaning of writing, which is difficult to read.

35
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,760
Experts hoped that the Egyptian script contained great pearls of wisdom,

36
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,400
wise words, sayings or advice.

37
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,520
As we know, the actual meaning of the text turned out to be quite dull,

38
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,960
but it was the fact that the messages were written in three scripts, including Greek,

39
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,720
a language scholars already knew that provided the key to finally crack the code.

40
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:12,319
In 1801, the race was on between Egyptologists in Britain and France to be the first to translate

41
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,639
the entire system of hieroglyphs. In the end, it was a young Frenchman named Jean-François

42
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:24,400
Champollion, who became the first person to understand hieroglyphs since the ancient Egyptians

43
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,280
themselves, nearly 2,000 years earlier.

44
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,719
Here's Penelope Wilson, professor of Egyptian archaeology at Durham University,

45
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:38,800
explaining more about this remarkable young Frenchman to BBC Radio Falls in our time.

46
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,680
He was certainly a prodigy, I think, as far as language is concerned, but also had a fascination

47
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,240
for Egypt, I think, and the story is he was taught copdic by a copdic priest, and at that lecture

48
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,680
was one of the first to argue that copdic was related to ancient Egyptian.

49
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,840
So he was also encouraged by this by his older brother.

50
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,560
So I think there was seem to be no holding him back.

51
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,000
Once he got the bug, he was encouraged and he made great strides.

52
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,960
When Penelope Wilson calls Champollion a prodigy, she means someone young with a great natural talent

53
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:17,439
for something, in this case studying languages. Added to his natural ability was a fascination with

54
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:25,040
Egypt and the encouragement of his brother. So Champollion soon got the bug, suddenly developed a

55
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,200
strong enthusiasm for something. In English we often add a noun to describe exactly what

56
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:38,160
someone is enthusiastic about. So for example the skiing bug for someone who loves to ski.

57
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,800
Champollion was so enthusiastic there was no holding him back, an idiom to say that you were doing

58
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,200
something so eagerly you cannot be stopped. The story goes that he worked so hard deciphering

59
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,759
hieroglyphs. When he finally finished he ran through the streets of Paris shouting,

60
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,519
I've done it before collapsing unconscious. Rob, earlier you asked me which

61
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,920
pharaoh ordered the stone to be written? Yes and what did you say?

62
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,800
I thought it was Cleopatra, was I right? Well, Cleopatra was from the same dynasty,

63
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,680
but a little later than the correct answer which was B tolamy. The pharaoh who ruled from around

64
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:27,040
300 BCE. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned, starting with hieroglyphs.

65
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:34,400
Symbols used to represent words in ancient Egypt. The challenge was to decipher them,

66
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,879
to uncover the meaning of writing which is difficult to read or understand.

67
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,399
Maybe they contained pearls of wisdom, wise words, sayings or advice.

68
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,839
The hieroglyphic code was finally cracked by Jean-François Champollion, a prodigy or young person

69
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:58,560
with a great natural talent. When Champollion got the bug or suddenly became very enthusiastic

70
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:05,439
about understanding hieroglyphs, there was no holding him back. Nothing could stop him from succeeding.

71
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,799
And nothing can stop us from saying goodbye because our six minutes are up. Goodbye.
