00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,280
Hello and welcome to 6MtEnglish. I'm Alice.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,160
And I'm Neil.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,000
So Neil, did you sleep well last night?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,320
Uh, yes thanks. Why do you ask?

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,440
Today we're talking about how much sleep we need.

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,320
Ah, I like a good 8 hours myself, 10 at the weekend. How about you?

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,080
Ah, 6 is enough for me.

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,280
But did you know this?

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,480
Humans sleep around 3 hours less than other primates like chimps,

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,320
who sleep for about 10 hours.

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,759
So you're a chimp, Neil.

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,480
At the weekends at least.

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,359
Are you ready for the quiz question?

18
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:51,920
Okay, I'll assume that means yes.

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,960
Right, what's another word for sleepwalking?

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,000
Is it A?

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,119
Narkolepsy B?

22
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,880
Restless legs syndrome?

23
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,079
Or C?

24
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,680
Somnum mullism?

25
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,239
I will go for B. Restless legs syndrome,

26
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,159
since there's a connection with the legs.

27
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,079
Well, we'll find out whether you're right or wrong later on in the show.

28
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,640
So what keeps you awake at night, Neil?

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,599
Not much, to be honest. I usually sleep like a log.

30
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:21,840
And that means very heavily indeed.

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,560
But sometimes my own snoring wakes me up,

32
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,280
and then I can find it hard to get back to sleep.

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,599
Snoring for those of you who don't know

34
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:31,760
means breathing in a noisy way

35
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,400
through your mouth or nose while you're asleep.

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,840
Like that. How about you, Alice?

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,200
Very good, yes. Well, that's quite ridiculous.

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,120
Anyway, for me, it's drinking too much coffee during the day.

39
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,760
It's a caffeine in the coffee,

40
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,159
a chemical that makes you feel more awake,

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,480
which can stop you from sleeping at night.

42
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,359
But there are so many things that can keep us awake these days.

43
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,480
Oh, yes. Radio TV, techie stuff, like 24-hour internet computers,

44
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,519
smartphones. I love my phone. It's never far from me.

45
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:05,840
Well, let's hear what Professor Jerome Seagal

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,520
from the University of California found when he studied the sleep habits

47
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,759
of three different hunter-gatherer communities

48
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,879
who have very little contact with modern society.

49
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,680
They don't have artificial light, electricity,

50
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,560
batteries, or any of the gadgets that we rely on today.

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,199
Their sleep was not that different from ours.

52
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:31,920
The range of sleep period was about 6.9 to 8.5 hours.

53
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,159
If you actually measure sleep in current populations

54
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,000
in the United States or in Europe,

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,360
they're definitely at the low end of what's been reported.

56
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,400
They certainly don't sleep a lot less than we do,

57
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,319
but they clearly don't sleep more.

58
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:52,000
Professor Jerome Seagal found that people in these communities

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,319
don't go to bed until several hours after sundown, just like us.

60
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,479
But one big difference is that very few of them suffer from insomnia,

61
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,079
which means having difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep.

62
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:06,479
Now, I don't have a problem with insomnia

63
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,680
and hunter-gatherers, people who live by hunting animals

64
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,240
and gathering plants to eat, don't either.

65
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,680
Probably because they take a lot of physical exercise during the day.

66
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,120
Yes, that's right.

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,800
Taking exercise is an important factor in sleeping soundly or well at night.

68
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,920
But these days, our minds can be so active that it becomes very difficult to fall asleep.

69
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,400
Let's listen to Professor Kevin Morgan from Loveborough University here in England,

70
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,879
talking about how cognitive behavioral therapy can be used to help people with insomnia.

71
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,000
If you have a train of thoughts which would otherwise keep you awake,

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,680
one way of dealing with this is to block those thoughts.

73
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,680
What I'd like you to do is repeat the word THE in your mind at irregular intervals.

74
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,280
What you'll find is that the mind space required to do this

75
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,199
blocks out almost everything else.

76
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:11,360
So, Professor Kevin Morgan suggests saying one word over and over again at irregular intervals,

77
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,720
irregular, and this context means not spaced out evenly.

78
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,000
Doing it can help to block out the thoughts that are stopping you from getting to sleep.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,080
It sounds like a very simple solution.

80
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,040
Wonder if it works.

81
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,280
Hmm, there's one way to find out, Neil.

82
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,240
Try it yourself.

83
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,960
Hmm, I will.

84
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,080
Okay.

85
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,319
And cognitive behavioral therapy, by the way,

86
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,800
is a treatment for mental health problems that tries to change the way you think.

87
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,439
Well, I usually count sheep if I can't get to sleep.

88
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,480
Do you do that, Alice?

89
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,520
No, not usually, Neil.

90
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay, I think it's time for the answer to our quiz question.

91
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,079
I asked, what's another word for sleep walking?

92
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:56,000
Is it A, narcolepsy, B, restless leg syndrome, or C, some nambulism?

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,319
And I said B, restless leg syndrome.

94
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,839
Hmm, sorry, Neil.

95
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,560
It's actually C, some nambulism.

96
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,680
The roots of this word come from Latin.

97
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,360
Somnus means sleep, and ambulare means walk.

98
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,920
Narcolepsy is a condition where you can't stop yourself from falling asleep,

99
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,360
especially during the day.

100
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,360
Narcolepsy.

101
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,759
Hmm, and restless leg syndrome is a condition that makes you desperate to move your legs around,

102
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,439
especially when you're sitting quietly while trying to get to sleep.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,720
Get to sleep.

104
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,079
Now, Neil.

105
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,319
Well, wake up.

106
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,359
Oh, hello, Alice, sorry.

107
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:37,839
Hello.

108
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,319
Can we hear today's words again, please?

109
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,120
Ah, okay.

110
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,359
Sleep like a log.

111
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,199
Snoring.

112
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,279
Caffin.

113
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,599
Insomnia.

114
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,599
Hunter-gatherers.

115
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:54,240
Soundly.

116
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:56,719
Irregular.

117
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,839
Cognitive behavioural therapy.

118
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,519
Well, that just about brings us to the end of this edition of 6 Minute English.

119
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,519
We hope you've enjoyed this programme.

120
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,359

121
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:09,839
Bye.

122
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,319
Goodbye.
