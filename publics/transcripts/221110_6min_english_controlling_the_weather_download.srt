00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,240
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,320
And I'm Neil. It's raining again, Sam. I've had enough. It's been drizzling.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,960
That's raining lightly all week.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,320
I know what you mean, Neil. Living in a wet country like Britain,

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,240
I sometimes wish I could push a magic bus and stop it raining.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,520
And ironically, people living in hot, dry countries need rain, but don't get it.

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,600
If only we could control the weather.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,200
Well, it's funny you should say that, Neil, because you're not the first person to have that idea.

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,480
In this programme, we'll be hearing about cloud seeding and geoengineering.

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,400
Two controversial methods scientists are using to manipulate or change the weather.

13
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,920
And as usual, we'll be learning some new vocabulary as well.

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,679
Anything that stops it drizzling sounds good to me, Sam.

15
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:09,759
I hate to disappoint you, Neil, but these ideas involve making more, not less rain.

16
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:13,759
We'll learn the details soon, but first I have a question for you about the

17
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:20,560
wetest place in the world, a village which gets nearly 12 metres of rain a year.

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:28,640
But where is it? Is the wetest village on earth found in A, Ireland, B, New Zealand,

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,480
or C, India?

20
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,799
Well, it rains a lot in Ireland, doesn't it?

21
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,920
So I'll say that's where the wetest place on earth is.

22
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,840
Okay, Neil. We'll find out if that's the correct answer later in the programme.

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,680
The first type of weather manipulation we'll hear about is a way of getting snow and rain out of clouds,

24
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,280
known as cloud seeding.

25
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,239
Airplanes fly through the clouds and spray chemicals to make water particles freeze

26
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:58,400
and stick together as snowflakes. These then fall as snow, which builds up during winter,

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,439
before melting in spring to help water crops.

28
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,879
Listen as Charme in Cozier, presenter of BBC World Service programme The Inquiry,

29
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:13,199
speaks with Professor Katia Friedrich, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Colorado.

30
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,359
The first cloud seeding experiments took place in the 1940s,

31
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:21,599
in the air since scientists have often accused of meddling with nature.

32
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,399
People are thinking, yeah, you're putting some substances in the atmosphere that should not be there.

33
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:31,679
Usually I respond and say, every time you get into your car, every time you get on an airplane,

34
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:36,799
you put substances in the air that don't belong, so you're also playing God.

35
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:41,519
Because everyone needs water, cloud seeding is becoming more and more popular.

36
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,439
With scientists from over 50 countries, using the method to extract rain from clouds.

37
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:52,160
But some critics accuse these scientists of meddling with nature,

38
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,400
trying to change something, which it's not their responsibility to change.

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,600
In other words, they're accused of playing God,

40
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,160
acting as if they have unlimited power and can do whatever they want.

41
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,040
Unlike cloud seeding, the next type of weather modification has never been tested

42
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,199
and is still just a theory. Solar geoengineering aims to reduce global warming

43
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,639
by reflecting sunlight away from the earth back into space.

44
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:24,319
This involves putting tiny particles called aerosols into the stratosphere,

45
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,639
the band of sky 20 kilometres above the surface of the earth,

46
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,199
about twice as high as airplanes fly.

47
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,319
Although it's never been tested, the method is controversial.

48
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,959
As Charming Cozier discussed with Harvard University Professor of Engineering,

49
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,640
David Keith for BBC World Services, the Inquiry.

50
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,280
How controversial is this area?

51
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,400
There's lots of controversy around solar geoengineering, and for good reason,

52
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,480
people are, I think, sensibly scared that this could provide an excuse

53
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,680
that allows countries or companies to avoid doing the work that has to be done to cut emissions.

54
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,040
But in fact, controversy is really waxed and waned over time.

55
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,920
So in the early work on climate change in the 1960s and 70s and early 80s,

56
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,399
these ideas were just part of the way we talked about what might happen about climate change.

57
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:18,159
And then this climate change became more politically central, say, in the 90s and 2000s.

58
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:19,439
There was really a taboo.

59
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:25,759
David Keith believes that geoengineering could provide an excuse for inaction on climate change,

60
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,680
a reason for countries to explain why they did not take action.

61
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,360
He says controversy over the method has waxed and waned,

62
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,240
an idiom connected with the cycle of the moon,

63
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,800
which describes something that increases then decreases over time.

64
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,199
In the 1960s, for example, geoengineering was uncontroversial,

65
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:52,079
but by the 1990s, it had become taboo, a subject that is avoided for social or religious reasons.

66
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,920
While these ideas to change the weather have potential benefits,

67
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,840
other suggestions, for example, to position a giant floating mirror between the earth and the sun,

68
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,680
are highly controversial.

69
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,040
Although personally, I think the idea of a giant floating umbrella above Britain would be good.

70
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,120
Well, just think.

71
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,160
There are even a reindeer places to live, Neil, as I asked in my question earlier.

72
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,960
In which country is the world's rainiest village?

73
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,879
I guess it was in Ireland.

74
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:23,519
Which was the wrong answer I'm afraid.

75
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,040
In fact, Morse and Ram, the world's wettest village,

76
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,000
is in the Cassie Hills of Northeastern India.

77
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:35,199
With around 12 metres of rain a year, I guess it's not somewhere you'll be visiting, Neil.

78
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,839
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned,

79
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,759
starting with drizzling, which means raining lightly.

80
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,319
If you're meddling, you're trying to change something which is not your responsibility,

81
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,920
or without being asked to.

82
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,600
Someone who is playing God is acting as if they control everything and can do whatever they want.

83
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,519
An excuse is a reason you give to explain why you did something wrong.

84
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:02,159
If something waxed and waned, it grew stronger, then weaker over time.

85
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:07,039
And finally, a taboo is a subject that's avoided for social or religious reasons.

86
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,639
Once again, our six minutes are up.

87
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,680
Bye for now.

88
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,319
Bye bye.
