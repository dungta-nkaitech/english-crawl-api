6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish.com

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,280
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,560
And I'm Georgie.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:20,480
So Georgie, I'd like to know if you have any brothers or sisters and if you get on well with them.

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,600
Yes, I do. I have a sister and we get on very well.

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,640
We didn't use to, but now that we're adults, we get on well.

7
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:33,079
Well, in this programme we'll be discussing one of the closest relationships there is,

8
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:35,200
the connection between sisters.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,719
We'll hear from three Irish sisters, reuniting on a radio show.

10
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,280
And from a psychotherapist on some stereotypes about sisterhood.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,200
Plus, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary too.

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,079
And remember, if you want to read along while you listen,

13
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,159
you can find the script for this programme on our website, BBCLearningEnglish.com.

14
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:57,639
Yeah, great idea.

15
00:00:57,639 --> 00:01:02,239
Now, whether you have one or not, our history and culture is full of sisters

16
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,479
from the fairy tale of Cinderella and her ugly sisters to tennis players,

17
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,479
Venus and Serena Williams.

18
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,920
And currently, two sisters, Ellie and Rachel Reeves,

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,519
are senior ministers in the British government.

20
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:17,719
So Neil, my question for you is this.

21
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:20,479
What is Rachel Reeves' government job?

22
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,000
Is she A. Home Secretary?

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,120
B. Foreign Secretary?

24
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,960
Or C. Chancellor of the Exchequer?

25
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,120
Well, I think the answer is C, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,

26
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,840
which is the name for the finance minister in the UK.

27
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,000
OK, Neil, we'll find out if that's the correct answer later in the programme.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,920
Newlamma Governe, the presenter of BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, has two sisters.

29
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,320
They both live in Ireland, so they're joining me on a video call.

30
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,120
Hello, Eileen. Hello, Vera. Welcome to Woman's Hour.

31
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,159
Hello. Hello.

32
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,159
Hi.

33
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,159
Nula was born in Dublin and moved to New York, then London, to work as a journalist,

34
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,599
while her two sisters stayed in Ireland.

35
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:07,599
Here she introduces her older sister, Vera and younger sister, Eileen,

36
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,519
for a BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour special about sisterhood.

37
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:15,199
Nula was a little worried what her sisters would say about her on the radio,

38
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,159
so let's listen in and find out.

39
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:21,639
Eileen, what would you say if you were to describe our relationship as sisters?

40
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:27,039
Very connected, I think, and we do get on very well, which I'm proud to say.

41
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,039
Yes, I'm just right.

42
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,639
Here, I'm going to put you on the spot, Vera.

43
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,639
What word would you use to describe me as a sister?

44
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:40,000
I couldn't give you words, but you definitely marched to your own drum.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,199
What would that word be?

46
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,199
Independent.

47
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,319
Independent, definitely.

48
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,759
You liked to control the situation.

49
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,239
Eileen thinks she gets on with her sisters.

50
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,640
To get on with someone means to like them and have a good relationship with them.

51
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,400
Nula puts her older sister on the spot by asking Vera to describe her in one word.

52
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,760
When you put someone on the spot, you make them answer a difficult question then and there,

53
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,240
sometimes making them embarrassed or uncomfortable.

54
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,520
But Nula didn't need to worry what her sisters would say.

55
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,560
Vera simply said that Nula marches to her own drum.

56
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:20,080
She does things in her own way, which may be different from how other people do things.

57
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,560
It seems Vera, Nula and Eileen have remained close friends as they've grown up,

58
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,199
but the relationship between older, middle, and younger sisters isn't always so harmonious.

59
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:34,240
Let's listen to BBC Radio 4's Women's Hour special programme

60
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,039
as Nula is joined by psychotherapist Jennifer Glethill.

61
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,199
Thank you very much to Eileen and Vera.

62
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,679
What a treat to have a chat with my sisters about sisters.

63
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:47,639
I want to bring in Jennifer here who's listening to it all.

64
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,319
Some of the stereotypes around siblings that the elder sister is bossy,

65
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:53,959
the middle sister is a peacemaker and the little sister is spoiled,

66
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:55,879
that is not applying to our family.

67
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:00,759
But I'm wondering, is there any substance about or why does that even get bandied around?

68
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,839
We love giving people labels, don't we?

69
00:04:02,839 --> 00:04:07,479
We like to put people into categories and then we can make sense of behaviours.

70
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,359
But actually, since then, scientists find no proof of being these rebels in the families.

71
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:20,199
Nula discusses stereotypes about siblings, a word that means either brother or sister.

72
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:23,879
One stereotype is that the older sister is usually bossy.

73
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:26,599
She enjoys telling people what to do.

74
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:30,279
Another stereotype is that the younger sister is spoiled.

75
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,599
If you describe a child as spoiled,

76
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:35,159
you mean they are allowed to do anything they want,

77
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,320
often with the result that they behave badly.

78
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,840
What do you think about these stereotypes, Georgie?

79
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,920
Are they true for you and your sister?

80
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:48,360
I'm not sure I agree with these stereotypes because the older sister is meant to be bossy,

81
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,680
but my younger sister is the bossy one.

82
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,200
I don't think I'm bossy at all.

83
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,560
Well, that's interesting.

84
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,240
Jennifer did say that there's no scientific proof.

85
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,240
Anyway, it's time now to find out the answer to your question, Georgie.

86
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:06,600
Yes, and my question was, what is Rachel Reeves' government job?

87
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,960
And you guessed she was the chancellor of the ex-checker,

88
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,879
which was the correct answer.

89
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,840
Well done, Neil.

90
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,720
Hooray!

91
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,720
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this program.

92
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,759
Starting with the phrasal verb, get on with someone,

93
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,319
meaning to have a good relationship with them.

94
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:27,240
If you put someone on the spot, you cause them embarrassment by forcing them to

95
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,360
answer a difficult question at that very moment.

96
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,520
If you march to your own drum, you do things in your own unique way,

97
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,680
regardless of how other people do them.

98
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,639
A sibling can mean either a brother or sister.

99
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,319
People who are bossy enjoy telling other people what to do.

100
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,639
And finally, a spoiled child is allowed to do whatever they want,

101
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,879
becoming badly behaved as a result.

102
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,120
Once again, our six minutes are up, but remember to head over to BBCLearningEnglish.com,

Bye for now.

106
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:03,879
Goodbye.
