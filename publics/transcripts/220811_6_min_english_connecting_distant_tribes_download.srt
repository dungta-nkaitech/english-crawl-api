6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,519
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,559
And I'm Sam.

6
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:23,039
Now, if you're old enough to remember the early days of dial-up internet,

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,800
then you'll know the unforgettable sound of the handshake.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,839
The clicks and squeaks your computer made as it struggled to connect to the internet

9
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:33,439
through the telephone line.

10
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,520
Yes, I remember that strange noise.

11
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,880
Dial-up internet was slow and websites took forever to load.

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,079
And because you couldn't use both the internet and the telephone at the same time,

13
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,880
this was usually followed by someone shouting,

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,240
get off the computer! I'm making a phone call!

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,640
In the 30 years since then, the internet has changed dramatically.

16
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,200
Fiber optics and broadband have created superfast internet speeds

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,079
and an interconnected online world where physical distances between people

18
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,719
are no longer a barrier to communication.

19
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,159
A situation expressed in the phrase, the global village.

20
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:18,640
But take a closer look and you'll still find people around the world with a slow connection

21
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,640
or no internet at all.

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,359
In this programme, we'll be finding out about how some communities are working together

23
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,400
to fix their internet connection problems for the benefit of local people.

24
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,840
And of course, we'll be learning some new vocabulary too.

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,560
But before that, I have a question for you, Sam.

26
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,439
We've been talking about the early days of the internet,

27
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,120
but do you know the name of the first ever internet browser?

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,120
The engine for searching websites?

29
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,039
Was it A, ask Jeaves, B, World Wide Web, or C, Yahoo?

30
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:54,000
Hmm, I guess it was C, Yahoo!

31
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,239
Okay, Sam, we'll find out the answer later.

32
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,280
You might think it's people living in the most remote and isolated places

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,280
with the greatest difficulty getting online, but that's not always true.

34
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,879
Even here in the UK, people struggle to connect,

35
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,680
including BBC Radio listener Katie,

36
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,920
who explained her problem to BBC World Service programme Digital Planet.

37
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,400
Hi, I'm Katie. I live in Dorset in England.

38
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,800
Our internet can be quite spasmodic here,

39
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,240
and I think that that's due to most of our underground cabling is very old,

40
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,439
and somewhat dodgy, tati, and need replacing.

41
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,240
Katie lives in Dorset, a rural part of southwest England.

42
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,320
She describes her internet connection as spasmodic,

43
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,120
suddenly working, but only for a short time,

44
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,800
and not in a regular way.

45
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,720
She thinks this is because her internet cables are dodgy,

46
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,360
slang for bad or untrustworthy.

47
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,480
A dodgy internet connection might be irritating,

48
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,400
but in other parts of the world, the consequences can be more serious.

49
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,880
Amahayet is a farmer who lives in the Pakistani Punjab,

50
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,760
one of the country's most fertile regions,

51
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,560
but also one of the least connected.

52
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,400
His village is a three-hour drive from the nearest town,

53
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,840
and he can't make a phone call, even with 2G.

54
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,080
For Amah, basic weather information, like knowing when rain is coming,

55
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,400
can mean the difference between his crops succeeding or failing.

56
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,160
Without the internet, he doesn't have a reliable weather report,

57
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:34,160
so the villagers decided to build their own 50-meter-high telephone transmission tower,

58
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,880
linking a network of five villages to the internet.

59
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,080
Here is Amah talking to BBC World Service Programme Digital Planet.

60
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,320
We used to do the conventional farming,

61
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,720
like just getting information from the world of mouth.

62
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,639
Now I'm using latest technologies to have gadgets available with us,

63
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,840
and taking information right from the harsh mouth,

64
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,599
you can say, through internet and the technology we have in our hands.

65
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,800
So this is what I'm doing in my farm practices.

66
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,639
Before the community-built tower brought the internet to his village,

67
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,079
Amah got his weather report by word of mouth,

68
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:13,280
information passed on by people telling each other.

69
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,520
Now there's stable internet that works,

70
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,720
thanks to a tower high enough to pick up a telephone signal,

71
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,879
which it then sends into the village's via solar-powered receivers.

72
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,439
A type of gadget, meaning a small, electronic device, which does something useful.

73
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,199
This means Amah now gets his weather reports straight from the horse's mouth,

74
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,000
an idiom meaning from a reliable source,

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,040
or from someone who knows what they're talking about.

76
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,120
The internet brings reliable, climatic information,

77
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,879
which means a good harvest, not just for Amah and his family,

78
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,480
but for all the families living in the five connected villages.

79
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,920
It's a great example of community action and of people looking after each other,

80
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,480
something which may have been lost since the early,

81
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,240
idealistic days of the internet.

82
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,720
And speaking of the early internet,

83
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,560
it's time to answer my question.

84
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,399
Remember, I asked you for the name of the very first internet browser.

85
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,079
I guess it was C, yeah, who, so was I right?

86
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,240
You were wrong, I'm afraid Sam.

87
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,279
Way back before Google, the first internet browser was called the World Wide Web,

88
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,120
invented by none other than cyber legend Sir Tim Berners-Leap,

89
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,519
who I think would be pleased to hear about Amah's community internet.

90
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,879
Yes, right.

91
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:34,639
Let's recap the vocabulary we've learned about internet connections between people living at a physical

92
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,759
distance in the modern world, something described as the global village.

93
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,279
If your internet is spasmodic, it's irregular,

94
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,000
stopping then suddenly working for a short time.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,959
In other words, it's dodgy, a slang word meaning bad or unliable.

96
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:56,480
If you know something by word of mouth, it's been passed verbally from person to person.

97
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,199
Whereas if you hear it from the horse's mouth,

98
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,480
it's come directly from a reliable source of information.

99
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,039
And finally, a gadget is a small electronic device with a useful purpose.

100
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,800
Once again, our six minutes are up.

101
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,600
Bye for now.

102
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,400
Bye.
