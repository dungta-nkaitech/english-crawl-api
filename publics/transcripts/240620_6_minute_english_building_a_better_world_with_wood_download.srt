00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,439
Hello, this is 6-Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:12,560
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,240
Being in nature has benefits for our physical and mental health.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,080
So wouldn't it be good if instead of giving you a bottle of pills,

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,039
your doctor recommended spending time in nature?

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,080
That's an interesting idea, Neil. Being outdoors always makes me feel better.

8
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,799
And in Japan, there's even a word for it,

9
00:00:30,799 --> 00:00:35,359
Shinrin Yaku translated into English as forest bathing.

10
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:41,599
Forest bathing is a type of relaxation that involves being calm and quiet amongst the trees

11
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:46,399
and using all your senses to observe nature around you while breathing deeply.

12
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,640
It sounds wonderful, Beth.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,200
In this programme, we'll be hearing how one of the world's oldest building materials,

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,759
wood, is being used in new ways to build a greener future.

15
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:01,920
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,679
Great, but first I have a question for you, Neil.

17
00:01:05,679 --> 00:01:08,640
Britain used to be covered in trees.

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,000
In Roman times, it's estimated that as much as 40% of the land was forest.

19
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,200
Trees provided wood, the building material needed for many things,

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,920
including buildings, furniture and chips.

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,039
So how many trees do you think were needed to build the HMS

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,480
victory, Nelson's famous ship at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805?

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:41,360
Was it A, 4000 trees, B, 5000 trees, or C, 6000 trees?

24
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,520
Well, I have no idea, but I'll guess it was 5000 trees.

25
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,360
Okay, Neil, I'll reveal the correct answer at the end of the programme.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,160
Throughout history, buildings in Britain have been made of timber,

27
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,000
trees that are grown so their wood can be used as a building material.

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,439
But in modern times, this has mostly been done by man-made materials,

29
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,280
brick, concrete and steel.

30
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,879
One of those arguing for a return to wood is architects Michael Rammage,

31
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,560
talking here to BBC Radio 4 programme Rare Earth.

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,319
There is some compelling evidence to show that children in schools made of wood

33
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,879
learn better, they have greater concentration, lower stress, lower heartbeats,

34
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:35,680
and there's compelling evidence to show that patients in hospitals recover better in both rooms

35
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,359
made of wood or other natural materials, and also in rooms that have views of nature out the window.

36
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,719
Michael believes there is compelling evidence for the health benefits of wood.

37
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,400
If something is compelling, it's so convincing that you believe it.

38
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,520
As evidence, he gives examples that wooden schools help children learn.

39
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:02,319
But there's another compelling reason to build with wood. The carbon which wood captures helps

40
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,080
combat climate change. It's why many governments around the world want to replace the carbon

41
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,280
intensive production of concrete and steel with biobased materials like wood.

42
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:19,120
Here's architect Michael Rammage again describing the possibilities of wooden buildings to

43
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,360
BBC Radio 4's Rare Earth.

44
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:29,120
We look at the possibilities of building with wood and other materials we can grow, bamboo,

45
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:38,879
hemp, flax, and how we can use them intelligently as replacements for steel and concrete in the world

46
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,480
that we create around us. We've looked at skyscrapers, we've looked at housing, we've looked at

47
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,439
schools and there are a whole range of buildings that we can build if we use wood well.

48
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:57,599
Michael builds with natural materials which can be sustainably grown, including bamboo and hemp,

49
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,239
a family of plants which are used to make many products such as rope and cloth.

50
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,719
He thinks these natural biobased materials will work if they are used intelligently

51
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,959
in a clever, intelligent way.

52
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:16,800
A good example of this is plywood, the first new material in construction since the invention of

53
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:22,960
reinforced concrete a hundred years ago. Tests prove that plywood made from layers of pine,

54
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,280
which are laid crossways and then glued together, is as strong as steel.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,920
It's already been used to build skyscrapers, the very tall modern buildings you often see in cities.

56
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,920
An 85 metre high skyscraper in Norway and an even taller one at 87 metres the world's tallest

57
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:49,439
in Milwaukee, USA. Strong, relaxing, and eco-friendly. It seems that building with wood is good for

58
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:55,680
the future as well as the past, which reminds me of my question, Neil. Yes, you asked me how many

59
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,720
trees we used as timber for Nelson's famous warship HMS Victory and I guessed it was 5,000.

60
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:10,960
Which was close, but the wrong answer I'm afraid. It was even more, around 6,000 trees,

61
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,680
most of which were oak, with some timbers over half a metre thick.

62
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,560
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt in this programme starting with forest bathing,

63
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,320
being in nature and immersing your senses in the experience for its physical and mental health

64
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:35,519
benefits. Timber is trees grown so the wood can be used for building. If an argument or evidence is

65
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:42,639
compelling, it's strong, convincing, and believable. The adverb intelligently means done in a way

66
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,319
showing intelligence and skill. Hemp is a family of plants, some of which are used to make a

67
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:55,199
rope and strong cloth. And finally, a skyscraper is a very tall modern building, usually in a city.

68
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,599
Once again, our six minutes are up, but remember to join us again next time for more
