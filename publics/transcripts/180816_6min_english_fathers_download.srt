00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,359
Hello and welcome to 6MuteEnglish. I'm Catherine.

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,399
And I'm Neil.

7
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,320
Now Neil, you're a dad, aren't you?

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,719
I am a dad. How did you know?

9
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:23,839
Is it the grey hair in my beard? Is it the wrinkles around the eyes?

10
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,519
I thought that was just your age.

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,199
Well, yes, maybe.

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,320
In today's programme, we're going to be talking about fathers

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,679
and how being a father has changed over the years.

14
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:35,679
But before we hear more about this topic,

15
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:36,799
our question for the day.

16
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:39,600
According to recent research in the UK,

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,359
what percentage of men are present when their children are born?

18
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:49,920
Is it A 55% B 75% or C 95% what do you think?

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,159
I think a lot of men these days like to see their children born.

20
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,079
It's not culturally inappropriate.

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,439
So I'm going to go for 95%.

22
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,560
Well, we'll find out if you're right at the end of the programme.

23
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,719
Now, Dr Anna McInn is an evolutionary anthropologist.

24
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,719
She studies, among other things,

25
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:11,759
how human behaviour has changed and is changing.

26
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,879
She's written a book called The Life of Dad.

27
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,840
She's been studying new fathers and spoke about her research

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,640
on the BBC's Woman's Hour programme.

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,280
She asked why men want to become fathers.

30
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,079
She starts by saying that there are lots of reasons,

31
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:28,320
but how many does she mention in her answer?

32
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,320
There's lots of different reasons why men want to be fathers.

33
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,040
For some of them, it's just the stage in life they've reached.

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,640
You know, they've got the house, they've got the job now.

35
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,000
It's time to have a family.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,799
Sometimes they admit that actually they're not that keen,

37
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,319
but they're part of the once-baby.

38
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:43,920
So they're kind of going along with it.

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,799
And a reasonable number actually say they do it

40
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,840
because they want to undo what their father did to them.

41
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,320
So rewrite history in relation to fathers

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,760
and the experience of fathering

43
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,920
to be a better father than their father was.

44
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,200
How many reasons does she mention?

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,120
She mentioned three reasons.

46
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,320
The first was that it was that time in life.

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,439
The guys had a home and a job and a having children

48
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,120
was the thing to do next.

49
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,480
Another reason was that it was what their partners wanted,

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,120
even if they weren't that keen themselves.

51
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,560
If you're not keen on something,

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,120
it means you're not enthusiastic about it.

53
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,439
It's not really something you want to do,

54
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,080
but because it's what their partner wants,

55
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,520
they agree to do it.

56
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,480
Or as Dr. MacKin said, they're going along with it.

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,560
Yes, going along with something

58
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,599
is a phrase that means agreeing to do something

59
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,400
even though you don't really want to do it.

60
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
It's interesting that Dr. MacKin said

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,960
that some men admit to this.

62
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,040
To admit to something is to say or agree that something's true

63
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,360
even if you're perhaps ashamed of it

64
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,280
or you don't want it to be true.

65
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,040
There was one more reason she mentioned

66
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,360
and that was that some men become parents

67
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,360
because they want to be a better father

68
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,280
than their own father had been.

69
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,240
Let's listen again.

70
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,320
There's lots of different reasons why men want to be fathers.

71
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,040
For some of them, it's just the stage in life they've reached.

72
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,640
You know, they've got the house, they've got the job now.

73
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,920
It's time to have a family.

74
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,800
Sometimes they admit that actually they're not that keen

75
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,320
but they're partner wants a baby.

76
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,840
So they're kind of going along with it.

77
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,800
And a reasonable number actually say they do it

78
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,840
because they want to undo what their father did to them.

79
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,320
So rewrite history in relation to fathers

80
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,760
and the experience of fathering

81
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,840
to be a better father than their father was.

82
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,520
So what is it about some fathers own dads

83
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,719
that they didn't like?

84
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,840
Is Dr. MacKin again?

85
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,480
Well, in some cases, you know, the father would be neglectful.

86
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,120
Some fathers were absent.

87
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
And others, they just felt that they were a very,

88
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,880
I suppose we'd say, 1950s father.

89
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,439
So distant, disciplinary,

90
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:47,520
and not actually involved in their child's daily life

91
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,359
and certainly not involved in their care.

92
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:50,960
So today's generation fathers,

93
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,120
even in the 10 years that I've been studying dads,

94
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,879
we've seen a massive evolution

95
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,159
in how hands on fathers are.

96
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,159
She talks there about some negative characteristics

97
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,560
associated with dads in the past.

98
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,560
She suggests that some fathers didn't have

99
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,960
a very close relationship with their sons.

100
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,680
They were absent, which means they weren't at home a lot

101
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,919
and didn't spend time with their children.

102
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,520
Yes. And some fathers

103
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,280
were seen as disciplinarian.

104
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,639
That's described someone who's main communication

105
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,360
with their children was to give them strict rules

106
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,360
and tell them off or punish them

107
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,879
if they do something wrong.

108
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,639
These days, according to Dr. MacKin,

109
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,879
fathers are much more hands on.

110
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,879
This phrase means they are much more involved

111
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,639
with their children and share bringing up

112
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,400
their children with their partners.

113
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,680
I'm talking of sharing.

114
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,639
Neil, come on.

115
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,199
It's time to tell me the answer to today's question.

116
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:39,840
Yes, indeed.

117
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,400
According to recent research in the UK,

118
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,079
what is the percentage of fathers

119
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,319
who are there when their children are born?

120
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,479
Was it 55%, 75% or 95%?

121
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,839
And I said a very optimistic 95%.

122
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:55,599
Being optimistic is good, obviously,

123
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:56,799
because you are correct.

124
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:57,759
Yay!

125
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,879
That's fantastic.

126
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:01,599
And now for something else fantastic,

127
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:04,239
our review of today's vocabulary.

128
00:05:04,239 --> 00:05:06,399
We started off with admit two.

129
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,319
For when you say something's true,

130
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,759
even if it might make you look a little bit bad.

131
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,759
And before we go on, I have to admit,

132
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,399
Neil, that it was me who ate your biscuits.

133
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,120
Oh, which one?

134
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,560
The one you left on the desk.

135
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,079
Ah, that's all right.

136
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,920
I wasn't really keen on it anyway.

137
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,039
It had been on the floor.

138
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:23,839
What?

139
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,560
Ooh.

140
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,159
Yeah, well, serves you right.

141
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,959
And to be keen on something is our next phrase,

142
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,719
meaning being very interested in

143
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:32,959
and enthusiastic about something.

144
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,599
Then we had to go along with something.

145
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:37,759
This is when you were great to do something,

146
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,000
even if you're not keen on it.

147
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,879
An absent father is one who is not at home

148
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,879
to spend time with his children.

149
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,079
And some fathers are disciplinarians.

150
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,959
They have strict rules and they give out punishments.

151
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,600
But these days, more fathers are hands-on,

152
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,560
which means that they're very much involved in looking after

153
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,240
and bringing up their children.

154
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,319
Well, that's all we have time for today.

155
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,600
