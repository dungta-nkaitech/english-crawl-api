Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,960
I'm Dan and joining me today is Catherine. Hey, Catherine.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,679
Hey, Dan.

6
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,679
So, Catherine, do you prefer a brew or a cup of Joe in the morning?

7
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,039
Oh, well, if you're referring to whether I prefer a cup of tea,

8
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,480
which we sometimes call a brew or a cup of coffee,

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,799
sometimes called a cup of Joe, I prefer my coffee in the morning.

10
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:36,240
I only drink coffee when I really need to wake up quickly.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,320
Mmm, and why are you asking, Dan?

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,560
Because it's part of this 6 Minute English.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,679
Coffee, I see. So how do you take it, then, Dan?

14
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:46,000
Well, I'm an instant coffee kind of guy,

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,320
and I like mine with a dash of milk.

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,200
How about you?

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,920
A dash of something is a small amount of something, especially liquid.

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,079
Personally, I prefer freshly ground coffee beans,

19
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,079
and I like my coffee dark and strong,

20
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,159
preferably Colombian or maybe Brazilian.

21
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,039
Wow, a coffee aficionado, eh?

22
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:13,759
An aficionado is a person who's very enthusiastic about

23
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:17,039
or interested in a particular subject.

24
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:21,120
Well, let me test your knowledge with this week's quiz question.

25
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,759
The speciality coffee, Copi L'Ouac,

26
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,640
is made from coffee beans which have already passed

27
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,280
through an animal's digestive system.

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,040
But which animal?

29
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,480
Is it A, an elephant?

30
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,599
B, a cat or C, a weasel?

31
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,719
I'm always going to answer B, a cat.

32
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,239
Did you say this coffee actually goes through the animal?

33
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,560
As in, it eats it, and then it comes out the other end,

34
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,200
and that's what we use for the coffee?

35
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,400
Well, yes, it is actually one of the most expensive coffees in the world.

36
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,080
Anyway, we'll find out if you're right or not later on.

37
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,760
So talking of expensive, do you tend to pay more for your coffee

38
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,480
or are you happy with the cheapest chips stuff?

39
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,200
Chippers chips means very cheap.

40
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,400
And personally, I do actually like a quality product,

41
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,280
and I am willing to pay a bit more for it.

42
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,120
Would you be willing to pay even more than you already do

43
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,920
if it meant that the farmer who grew the beans

44
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
was getting a fairer price?

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,199
I would, because I think that that sort of thing is important.

46
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,799
And you aren't alone.

47
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:31,199
There's a growing trend among many Western customers of artists and cafes

48
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:35,279
to be willing to pay more for ethically-produced coffee.

49
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:37,759
Ethical means morally right.

50
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,359
So, Dan, why is this trend happening at the moment?

51
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:43,919
Well, it's probably been going on for a while,

52
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,079
but a new report from the UN's World Intellectual Property Organization

53
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:51,039
has observed the effect that smarter processing,

54
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:56,239
branding and marketing has had on the farmers and their communities.

55
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,239
And because of this, coffee drinkers are better able to choose ethically-produced coffee

56
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,840
that puts more money in the hands of the farmers.

57
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,479
But, Dan, do the farmers actually see any of this money?

58
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,479
Well, it's complicated.

59
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,879
The price of the coffee is relatively cheap

60
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,319
until it's been roasted or cooked in an oven.

61
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,840
As a result, roasters take most of the profits.

62
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,079
But there is still a difference.

63
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,439
I'll let Jonathan Joseph's a business reporter for the BBC News explain.

64
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,560
For a pound of coffee beans that end up in the instant-sold-in supermarkets,

65
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,280
the roaster can get over $4.

66
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,400
But the export price is just $1.45.

67
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,079
The farmer gets most of that.

68
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:47,039
But when the new wave of socially-aware customers pays a premium for higher standards,

69
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,400
the roaster can get $17.45.

70
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,079
But the export price also rises to $5.14.

71
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,280
A premium is an amount that's more than usual.

72
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,120
So if the farmer makes three and a half times as much money,

73
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,079
which means a better quality of life for the farmer,

74
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,879
their family and their community.

75
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:09,759
That's good news.

76
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,359
I will definitely look for the ethically-produced coffee from now on.

77
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,199
As long as Dan, it doesn't come out of some animal.

78
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,639
Yes, actually, that reminds me our quiz question.

79
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,439
I ask you which animal the speciality coffee Copi-Lawak comes from.

80
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,120
Is it A, an elephant?

81
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,160
B, a cat or C, a weasel?

82
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,520
And I said a cat.

83
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,360
And you were wrong, I'm afraid.

84
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,080
Copi-Lawak comes from a type of weasel.

85
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,759
I'm kind of relieved about that.

86
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,520
Let's try not to think about it and have a look at the vocabulary instead.

87
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:44,240
Okay, so first we had dash.

88
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,279
A dash of something is a small amount of something,

89
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,799
usually illiquid.

90
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:51,759
Where might we talk about a dash of something, Dan?

91
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,319
Well, I like my tea with a dash of milk,

92
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,319
my gin with a dash of tonic, and my soup with a dash of salt.

93
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,199
Then we had a fishanado.

94
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,560
An fishanado is someone who's very interested or enthusiastic about a subject.

95
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,399
What are you an fishanado of?

96
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,199
I'm working on becoming a bit of an accordion of fishanado, actually, Dan.

97
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,079
Wow, cool.

98
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:14,959
Yeah.

99
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,039
After that, we had cheap as chips.

100
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,639
If something is cheapest chips, then it's very cheap indeed.

101
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,759
Like my shoes.

102
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,479
I bought them at a market for next to nothing.

103
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,959
They were as cheap as chips.

104
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,719
Then we had ethical.

105
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:31,759
Something which is ethical is morally right.

106
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,560
Do you consider yourself to be an ethical person, Catherine?

107
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,000
Well, I try, Dan.

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,560
I don't always get it right, but I do attempt to be.

109
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,319
After that, we heard roasted.

110
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,839
Roasted means cooked in an oven, like our coffee beans.

111
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,279
And of course, our very famous English roast.

112
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:49,439
Finally, we had a premium.

113
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,879
If you pay a premium, you pay more than usual,

114
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,920
usually for a better quality or service.

115
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,360
Can you think of an example?

116
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,079
If you're going to the cinema, you might pay a premium

117
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,839
to get more comfortable seats.

118
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:04,240
