Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,719
And I'm Neil. Sam, do you remember an old children's television show called Lassie?

4
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,280
Yes, I grew up watching the adventures of schoolboy Timmy and its pet dog,

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,359
a collie named Lassie. Whenever Timmy got lost or into trouble,

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,320
Lassie sensed danger and came to the rescue.

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,400
If you believe shows like Lassie, pets know when their human owners feel afraid or in danger.

8
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,960
But in real life, do animals know or care about human feelings?

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,640
Now, Neil, obviously we're not talking about wild animals, right?

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,320
We're talking about domesticated animals.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,920
Types of animals which are under human control and have been living closely with people for centuries.

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,600
They include pets like cats and dogs, working animals and farm animals like cows and sheep.

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,079
So, what about dogs like our friend Lassie? Do you think they can sense human feelings?

14
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,400
It's hard to know what's really going on behind a dog's big brown eyes.

15
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,920
Unlike humans, pets can't talk to say how they're feeling,

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,799
and this makes it easy for us to misunderstand them.

17
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,879
People often anthropomorphise their pets, treat them as if they were human by giving them human

18
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:32,799
characteristics. In cartoons, Mickey Mouse can talk and Donald Duck dances and things,

19
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,319
but we know mice and ducks don't really do that in nature.

20
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:42,239
Exactly, but recently, new research has suggested that sometimes pets do respond to their own

21
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:47,439
as feelings. Okay, well, before we find out more, I have a quiz question for you, Neil.

22
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,239
Lassie wasn't the only TV show to feature a boy and his pet companion. A similar show,

23
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:59,280
Skippy was setting Australia, but what type of animal was the star?

24
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,280
Was Skippy A a rabbit, be a frog or see a kangaroo?

25
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,159
Well, if Skippy was Australian, I'll guess he's see a kangaroo.

26
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,039
Okay, I'll reveal the answer later in the program.

27
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:17,599
Now, Neil, earlier you mentioned that because animals can't speak,

28
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,560
it's difficult to know their feelings about us.

29
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,719
Difficult, yes, but not impossible. Recently, anthrozoologist Dr Karen Heastand

30
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,120
designed an experiment to test whether our pets really do care about us.

31
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,439
She filmed pet owners pretending to be hurt and observed the reactions of their dogs and cats.

32
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,719
Here's Aegean Washborne, producer for BBC World Service Programme Health Check,

33
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,560
pretending to hear his leg at home where he lives with his two pets, a cat and a dog.

34
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,560
And now I'm going to fake an injury and we'll see how they respond.

35
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,360
Well, the tailwaking has got a bit more, there's a bit of a yawn, so I don't think they were

36
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,800
particularly sensitive or bothered that I was squealing around the floor in agony holding my leg

37
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,439
up in the air trying to feign an injury. Meanwhile, the cat who's on the windowsill is looking at me

38
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,880
with wide eyes. Adrian didn't really hurt his leg, he feigned or pretended to be hurt.

39
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,080
He pretended to be an agony, extreme physical pain, to see what his pets would do.

40
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:38,160
Aegean's dog wagged his tail and gave a yawn. The cat meanwhile just looked at him with wide eyes,

41
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,319
little evidence of pets showing care or concern there, you might think.

42
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,319
But according to Dr Heesdan, the animal's behaviour makes perfect sense when you remember where

43
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,479
they came from. Dogs are descended from ancient breeds of wolves, very social animals who

44
00:03:54,479 --> 00:04:00,159
live together in packs, so it makes sense that a dog would sniff and come closer to investigate

45
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,680
what was happening. Cats on the other hand are solitary creatures, descended from wild cats who

46
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,599
lived and hunted alone. Dr Heesdan thinks this explains the reaction of Adrian's cat,

47
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,480
as she told BBC World Service Programme Health Check.

48
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,800
What we're seeing typically is cats staying much more still,

49
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,160
that they're looking and looking at their owner, so they're definitely paying their owner

50
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,160
awful lot of attention when they're displaying this negative distress emotion,

51
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,399
compared to during the control procedure where they're just doing cat things, walking around,

52
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:36,959
grooming that kind of thing. The experiment showed the different responses of cats and dogs to

53
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:43,679
human distress, feelings of worry, sadness or pain. In the experiment, dogs were visibly concerned,

54
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:48,959
while cats simply paid more attention to what was going on. Some cats did nothing except carry

55
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,959
on grooming, cleaning themselves, using their tongue and paws. The experiment confirms the idea we

56
00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:01,519
have of cats being cold and anti-social. And of dogs being our best friend. But according to Dr

57
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:07,519
Heesdan's findings, cats also feel human distress, they just show it in a different way.

58
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,479
Well, if the experiment included lassie, she'd probably phone the emergency services,

59
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:19,359
then make a junior cup of tea. And what about Skippy? Ah, yes. In my quiz question, I asked Neil,

60
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,240
about the Australian TV star Skippy. I guess that he was sea a kangaroo. Which was the correct

61
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:33,680
answer. Over two metres high, in able to jump nine metres in a single hop, you'd be in safe hands

62
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,560
with Skippy the kangaroo. Right, let's recap the vocabulary from this programme,

63
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:46,000
starting with domesticated, a word to describe animals which are not wild and live under human control.

64
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,199
To anthropomorphise means to give animals human qualities and characteristics.

65
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:57,040
If you feign illness, you pretend to be ill when you're not. To be an agony means to be an

66
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:04,240
extreme physical pain. Someone whose distress feels worry, pain or sadness. And finally, grooming

67
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,600
is how some animals clean themselves using their tongue and paws. That's all the time we have for

68
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
this programme. Bye for now. Bye.
