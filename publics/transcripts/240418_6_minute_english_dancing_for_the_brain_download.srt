00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,919
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:13,200
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,320
Do you love to boogie on down, strut your stuff and throw shapes, Beth?

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,719
What I mean is, do you like dancing?

6
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:22,960
Yes, I love to dance.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,640
Just listening to the music and letting it move my body.

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,920
What about you, Neil? Do you often hit the dance floor?

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,039
Sometimes, but I'm not a great dancer. To be honest, I get a bit embarrassed.

10
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:40,399
But maybe I shouldn't, because it's been proved that dancing has many physical and mental health

11
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,719
benefits, including releasing stress, boosting your mood, or just enjoying a fun night out.

12
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,880
In this programme, we'll be hearing how dancing can benefit our brains and emotions at every

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:58,560
stage of life. And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,079
Of course, another great thing about dance is that there are so many different styles,

15
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,320
from ballet and ballroom dancing to tap, hip hop and jazz.

16
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,719
But my question is about a very unusual style, a traditional English folk dance where performers

17
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:20,719
wearing black hats and colourful waist coats hit sticks together while moving in patterns.

18
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,239
But do you know the name of this unusual dance bet?

19
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:30,239
Is it A, the Highland Fling, B, Flamenco or C, Morris Dancing?

20
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,959
I think the answer is Morris Dancing.

21
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay, we'll find out later in the programme.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,159
Besides Beth, someone else who loves to dance is Julia Raevie,

23
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,840
presenter of BBC Radio programme Mental Muscle.

24
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,519
Here, Julia tells us exactly why she loves dancing so much.

25
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,119
I love nothing more than a night or a day out where I can just dance like no one's business.

26
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,039
To me, it's just such a release and it's something that I definitely rely on to get the stress

27
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:07,759
out of my body. And I now absolutely love to move any chance I get.

28
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,840
I'll dance now. I know everyone's not a fan because some people can find dancing to be

29
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,480
awkward or uncomfortable and I've seen people who just avoid the dance floor at all costs.

30
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,879
But, Dancing is so good for us and potentially our brains.

31
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,800
Julia can dance like nobody's business, an idiom meaning very well or very quickly.

32
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,439
For her, dancing is a release, a way of freeing emotions, feelings or tension from her body.

33
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,520
Not everyone is the same as Julia though and if like me, the thought of dancing makes you

34
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,199
uncomfortable, you might avoid the dance floor at all costs. No matter what happens.

35
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,280
That's a pity, Neil, because the benefits of dancing are huge.

36
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,400
Just ask Dr Peter Levitt, also known as Dr Dance.

37
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,079
Over four decades, he's studied how dancing helps improve brain function in everyone

38
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,400
from children and adults to older people living with diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.

39
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,960
Dr Levitt's dance therapy involves spontaneous movements, closing your eyes and letting the

40
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,880
music move you. It promotes divergent thinking leading to happier, more creative brains.

41
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:33,520
So, how can we get more people dancing? That's exactly what Julia Raevi asked Dr Levitt

42
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,000
for BBC Radio programme Mental Muscle.

43
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:44,879
What would you say to the person listening who maybe doesn't dance at all right now?

44
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,759
Maybe we'd like to dance a bit more, maybe for them there's still a little bit on the fence

45
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,479
about whether they want to dance. How can everyone get a little bit more movement into their daily life?

46
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,840
Okay, so very first thing to do, I would suggest is to lay on your bed with your eyes closed

47
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,960
and to find a piece of music that you like. Close your eyes and then just hear the beat and

48
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,360
feel the rhythm. So think about where in your body do you feel a twitch?

49
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:18,079
Julia mentions people who are sitting on the fence who still haven't decided if they will do

50
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:25,199
something or not in this case dance. Dr Levitt's advice is simple, get comfortable, close your eyes

51
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:32,399
and listen to some music. Soon you'll feel a twitch, a small sudden and involuntary movement

52
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,399
somewhere in your body. From there it's only a few steps to dancing.

53
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:42,000
It seems a dancer day keeps the doctor away. So what do you reckon Neil? Are you ready to give

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,639
it a go? Maybe after I've revealed the answer to my question. Right, you asked for the name of the

55
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:55,439
traditional English folk dance where dancers wear colorful waist coats and hit sticks. And I

56
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:02,000
guess it was Maurice Dancing? Well, that was the correct answer, Beth. Maurice Dancing is the name

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,079
of the unusual English folk dance, not flamenco, which of course is Spanish, or the Highland Fling,

58
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:14,479
which comes from Scotland. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned starting with Boogie,

59
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:21,200
strut your stuff through shapes and hit the dance floor or modern idioms meaning to dance.

60
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,160
If you do something like nobody's business, you do it very well or very quickly.

61
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,600
A release is the act of freeing emotions, feelings or tension from the body.

62
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,960
If something must be done at all costs, it must be done whatever happens, even if it involves

63
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:45,599
a lot of difficulty, time or effort. Someone who sits on the fence delays making a decision or

64
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:52,159
choosing one course of action over another. And finally, a twitch is a sudden jerky movement or

65
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:59,759
spasm in your body, often involuntary. Once again, our six minutes are up. Join us again soon for more
