Hello, I'm Rob and this is 6 Minute English,

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,640
the show that brings you an interesting topic,

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,320
authentic listening practice,

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,920
and some vocabulary to help you improve your language skills.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,160
And hello, I'm Neil.

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,839
Our topic today is transport.

9
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,159
How do you think you'll be travelling to work in say 30 years time, Rob?

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,320
Well, not only will home working be more prevalent, that means common,

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,280
but I hope I won't be working in 30 years time.

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,320
Good answer.

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,399
But if we look back and see how transport has changed in the last 30 years,

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,879
it makes you wonder what the future holds.

15
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,120
Yes, we've seen how air travel has become commonplace for many people.

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,600
Commonplace means not unusual.

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,320
And there's been the development of high speed train travel.

18
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,640
But the main priority has been speed,

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,200
going faster to make your journey quicker.

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,319
That's true, and we'll be discussing some ideas for making transport even faster soon.

21
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:10,480
But let's not waste any time and speed on to today's quiz question.

22
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,680
Yes, time waits for no one, not even you, Neil.

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,599
So, can you answer this question?

24
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,519
According to Guinness World Records,

25
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,760
in which country has the fastest ever train been recorded?

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,840
Is it in a China,

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,320
B, Japan, or C, France?

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,520
Mmm, all these countries have fast trains,

29
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,480
but I've heard the Chinese trains go particularly fast,

30
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,560
so I'm going to say, A, China.

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,880
Well, you'll have to wait until the end of the programme to see if you're right.

32
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,320
But let's talk more now about the future of transport.

33
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,520
One development we hear much about is automation.

34
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,920
Automation means using machines to do work that humans normally do.

35
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,520
And in terms of transport, this means driverless vehicles.

36
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,439
It won't be too long before we become the passenger in a driverless car.

37
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,640
Hmm, scary.

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,679
And the French train engineering company Allstom

39
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:05,039
is planning to test automated freight trains later this year.

40
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:11,120
The automated train prototype can travel for about 100 kilometres without driver intervention.

41
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,280
A prototype is the first version of something which can be tested

42
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,439
before it's produced in large quantities.

43
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,719
Of course, some trains are already driven by computers,

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,960
but there's an exciting plan to develop a form of driverless vehicle

45
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:31,039
that could move you around at 1,123 kilometres per hour.

46
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,599
Come on, Neil. That sounds a bit far-fetched.

47
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,400
Like flying cars that we see in sci-fi movies,

48
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,599
it's difficult to believe because it's unlikely to happen.

49
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,520
Well, you say that, but it's already being tested in Nevada in the USA,

50
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,000
and has a name Hyperloop 1.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,199
Oh, tell me more.

52
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,079
The idea is you get loaded into a pod,

53
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,800
and then you're pushed through a metal tube at high speed,

54
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,320
taking you to your destination in minutes rather than hours.

55
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,000
Anita Sengukta is the lead systems engineer and says there's nothing scary about it.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,320
The Hyperloop is a Maglev train in a vacuum system,

57
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,280
or a vacuum tube.

58
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,800
And so you can also think of it as an aircraft flying at 200,000 feet,

59
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
so people don't have any issue flying in airplanes,

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
and people don't have any issue going in Maglev trains.

61
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,760
This is simply combining the two and allows you to be more energy-efficient.

62
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,199
So Anita Sengukta explained the type of technology the Hyperloop used.

63
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,120
First, she mentioned Maglev.

64
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,159
That's a short way of saying magnetic elevation.

65
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,639
It's when trains travel on magnetic track rather than conventional rails.

66
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,199
And then she mentioned a vacuum system.

67
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,599
A vacuum is a space that has all the air and other gases removed from it,

68
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,159
so the tube, these pods traveling, have no air, so there's no resistance.

69
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,519
And these technologies are more efficient and they save energy.

70
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,719
Which is a good thing.

71
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,800
This sounds like a great way to travel, but will it take off?

72
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,280
Well, BBC Technology correspondent Rory Kethelin Jones isn't so sure.

73
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,160
He thinks it will be quite challenging to convince governments to allow long metal tubes

74
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,080
to be built on or below ground.

75
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,800
But we have to try these new technologies, Rob.

76
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,480
If we didn't, we'd still be traveling around on horse and cart.

77
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,920
Hmm, a good point, Neil.

78
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,280
And we wouldn't have been able to travel at the great speeds mentioned in today's question.

79
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,399
Now, earlier, I asked you, according to Guinness World Records,

80
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,159
in which country has the fastest ever train travelled?

81
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:28,319
Is it in a China, be Japan or see France?

82
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,799
And I said, a China.

83
00:04:31,679 --> 00:04:32,639
And you were wrong, no?

84
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,399
China does have some very fast trains,

85
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:41,759
but the fastest recorded train was a maglev from the central Japan railway company,

86
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,079
which ran on a test track at a speed of 603 kilometers per hour.

87
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:48,639
Now, that would make my commute to work very quick.

88
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,120
Hmm.

89
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,759
Okay, shall we recap some of the vocabulary we've heard today, starting with

90
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,719
commonplace?

91
00:04:54,719 --> 00:04:58,560
Yes, which means not unusual or often seen.

92
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,479
For example, free wifi and coffee shops is commonplace these days.

93
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,759
And very useful it is, too.

94
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,599
Next, we had automation, meaning using a machine to do something instead of a human.

95
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:14,399
Automation in the car making industry has led to the loss of hundreds of jobs.

96
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,239
Of course, when you build a new car, you need to make a prototype.

97
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:23,759
That's the first version of something which can be tested before it's produced in large quantities.

98
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,439
The prototype of a new solar powered bike has been so successful that it's now going into mass production.

99
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:32,560
Come on, Rob, that sounds a bit far-fetched.

100
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,399
And by that, I mean, so unbelievable, it's unlikely to happen.

101
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:41,039
Well, something people once thought far-fetched is now a reality, and that's maglev,

102
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,560
that's short for magnetic elevation, and is how some of the world's fastest trains travel.

103
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,840
Finally, we discussed the word vacuum.

104
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,760
It's a space that has had all the air and other gases removed from it,

105
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,520
basically an empty space.

106
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:02,400
The plan for Virgin's Hyperloop 1 is to make a maglev even faster by putting it in a vacuum tube.

107
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,200
And that brings us to the end of today's 6 Minute English.

Bye.
