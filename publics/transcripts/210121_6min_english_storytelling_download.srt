4
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,519
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,960
And I'm Georgina.

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,839
Let me tell you a story, Georgina. Are you ready?

7
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,039
Yes!

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,199
Grandma had always warned me not to look into the mirror at midnight.

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,079
There was something strange about that mirror, she said.

10
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:32,879
How childish! To believe silly stories.

11
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,519
Later that night I heard a noise. I woke up dark and alone.

12
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:38,879
A clock chimed midnight.

13
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:42,240
The floorboards were creaking as I walked towards the mirror.

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,439
I looked into my face, reflecting in the glass.

15
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:48,000
When suddenly my eye winked.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,320
Ah, stop Neil, you're scaring me.

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,480
Sorry, Georgina.

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,920
Okay, let's try another story.

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,520
Once upon a time there was a beautiful servant girl who lived with her wicked stepmother

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,280
and two jealous step-sisters.

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,960
Ah, that's better Neil. And I know this story, Cinderella.

22
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,840
More romantic and much less scary.

23
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,640
As you can see from Georgina's reaction, telling stories is a powerful way to connect

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,240
and communicate with people.

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,920
And the topic of this programme.

26
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,640
Stories help us make sense of the world, which is why we've been telling them to each other for

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,480
millennia. And why some of the earliest folktales, stories that parents have told and passed on

28
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,400
to their children over many years are still being told today.

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,519
According to the novelist Sandra Newman and other academics, there are seven classic plot lines,

30
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,960
which are constantly being recycled into new stories.

31
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,319
They include rags to riches plots like Cinderella.

32
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,359
Defeating the monster plots like Dracula?

33
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,400
And other plots such as comedies, adventures and tragedies.

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,680
So my quiz question is this, which of the following well-known folktales

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,920
is a defeating the monster story?

36
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,160
Is it A, bear wolf, B, beauty and the beast, or C, goldilocks and the three bears?

37
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,480
Well, they all have beasts, bears or wolves in the title.

38
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,280
So I'll guess B, beauty and the beast.

39
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,080
Okay, Georgina will come back to that later.

40
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,040
It's interesting to ask how we can explain the lasting appeal of these classic plot lines.

41
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,599
Someone who might know is anthropologist and writer, Professor Jamie Tarrani.

42
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,439
Here he is talking to BBC World Services, the Y Factor.

43
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,199
See if you can spot his answer.

44
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:34,799
Often the reason why we feel so motivated to pass on stories is because the stories do tap in

45
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:42,000
to certain universal human fantasies and fears that will often transcend the concerns of

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,919
particular times and places.

47
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,120
We are intensely moralistic.

48
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,080
Most of the time, the bad guys have unhappy endings and the good guys have happy endings.

49
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,759
We know that in the real world, it doesn't actually work like that.

50
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:04,000
So there's an element of wish fulfillment that somehow satisfies our moral appetite.

51
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,479
Stories from very different cultures often have plots with similar fantasies and fears.

52
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:16,399
These human emotions are universal, meaning they exist everywhere and relate to everyone in the world.

53
00:03:16,399 --> 00:03:20,159
Classic stories work because they tap into basic human emotions.

54
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,919
They understand and express what it means to be human.

55
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,919
Unlike in the real world, stories can reinforce our sense of morality.

56
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,639
Evil stepmothers get punished.

57
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,399
Cinderella marries her prince and everyone lives happily ever after.

58
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:39,839
In this way, they create wish fulfillment, the achievement of what we really want and desire.

59
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,120
Well, so much for plot lines, Neil, but that still doesn't explain how stories have the power

60
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,439
to catch and hold our attention.

61
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,439
Let's hear from novelist Sandra Newman, author of How Not to Write a Novel,

62
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,560
a handbook of over 200 common mistakes.

63
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:01,120
Here she tells BBC World Services, the why factor that her absolute number one storytelling rule

64
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,120
is comprehensibility. People need to understand your story.

65
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,599
There are some people who actually are so unfortunately bad at communicating that even when they tell

66
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,240
a story to another person, it becomes incomprehensible.

67
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:23,759
And gradually as they stop making sense and ramble and digress and don't know where they're going,

68
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,240
you see everybody not only lose interest but become hostile.

69
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,840
People become very frustrated when someone is not getting to the point.

70
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,599
According to Sandra, the biggest mistake is incomprehensibility or not understanding the plot

71
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:42,719
because the storyteller is rambling, talking in a confused way, going off the subject or not

72
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:48,319
making sense. When listeners give a story their time and attention, they want the storyteller to get

73
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,879
to the point. Start talking about the most important and relevant information.

74
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:57,839
But to cut a long story short, Georgina, it's time to return to the quiz question.

75
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,799
Remember I asked you which famous folktale had a defeating the monster plot?

76
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:03,839
What did you say?

77
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,079
I said the answer was B, beauty and the beast. Was I right?

78
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,279
Your answer was...

79
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,759
I'll do get to the point Neil.

80
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:18,319
Wrong. In fact the answer is A, bear wolf, an old English epic about the hero bear wolf who defeats

81
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,759
dragons and beasts.

82
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,759
Well Neil, there are two sides to every story as the saying goes.

83
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,240
So let's recap the vocabulary we've learned starting with folktales,

84
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,399
popular stories that have been told and passed down over generations.

85
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:38,399
Many folktales contain universal ideas, ideas which exist everywhere in every age and culture.

86
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:44,000
Stories tap into these ideas, meaning they understand, connect to and express them.

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,360
Wish fulfillment means the achievement or realization of things you really want and desire.

88
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,280
A good storyteller will never ramble, talking a confused way,

89
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,400
often going off the subject or not making much sense.

90
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
And instead we'll get to the point.

91
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,480
Start talking about what is most important and relevant.

92
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,720
That's all we have time for but remember to join us again soon for the inside story on

93
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,080
trending English topics in vocabulary here at 6 Minute English.

94
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,879
Bye for now.

95
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,520
Goodbye.
