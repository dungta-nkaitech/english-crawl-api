Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,960
And I'm Neil.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,519
Did you have a cup of coffee this morning, Neil?

6
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,600
Oh, yes. I can't start the day without my morning cup of coffee.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,839
Or two, or three.

8
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:30,480
And what do you like about coffee so much?

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,880
Well, that lovely smell for one thing.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,640
And of course, it wakes me up and gets me ready to face the world.

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,480
Ah, you mean the caffeine hit, the effect of caffeine,

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,480
which is a natural stimulant on your brain,

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,159
making you feel more awake.

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,640
Do you think maybe you're addicted to coffee?

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,120
It's not just me, Sam. Have you seen how busy coffee shops are nowadays?

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,640
Full of people enjoying delicious coffee from all around the world?

17
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,960
Well, it wasn't always like that, Neil.

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,960
The first coffee to reach Britain in the 17th century took months to arrive by sea.

19
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,920
It was made by boiling raw coffee beans,

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,079
and apparently tasted awful.

21
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,319
In this programme, we'll be looking into the history of coffee in Britain.

22
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:17,920
And as usual, we'll be learning some related vocabulary too.

23
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,680
But before that, I have a question for you.

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,800
The earliest coffee to arrive in Britain took its name from the port in Yemen.

25
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,800
It was shipped from, so what was it called?

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:37,520
Was it A, Kapuchino, B, Mocka or C, Latte?

27
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,760
I'll say B, Mocka.

28
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,880
Okay, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,760
Britain's love affair with coffee started with the opening of London's first coffee shop in 1652.

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,200
People loved the effect.

31
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,840
Coffee made them more talkative and brighter.

32
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,000
It kept them awake for longer, and the drink became more and more popular.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,120
Within a decade, over 18 new coffee shops had opened in the city of London alone.

34
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,800
By the 1800s, though, tea had replaced coffee as the most fashionable drink,

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,840
partly because it was drunk by Queen Victoria.

36
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,040
Listen as Judith Hawley, an expert on 18th century literature,

37
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:21,120
takes up the story with BBC Radio 4 programme in our time.

38
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,120
It became more of a working class drink, so there were coffee shacks and carts,

39
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,439
like the sort of little street carts that you get still in London.

40
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,120
You get all over New York that is a cheap quick drink to perk you up.

41
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:39,120
And the temperance movement sponsored coffee taverns to try to wean working men off,

42
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,239
going to the pub for lunch.

43
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,000
So it moved.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,399
It declined seriously and has never fully recovered, even in the current coffee boom.

45
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:53,199
In the 17th century, there was a coffee boom, an increase in its popularity.

46
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:59,039
One of the reasons was that coffee perks you up, gives you more energy and makes you more active.

47
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,199
Drinking coffee was also supported by a social group called

48
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,599
the Temperance Movement, who campaigned to make alcohol illegal.

49
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,399
They used coffee to wean men off alcohol, make them gradually stop using something

50
00:03:14,399 --> 00:03:16,159
they had become addicted to.

51
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,079
Coffee changed British society and continues to do so today.

52
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:26,639
Here's Professor Judith Hawley again, talking to BBC Radio 4s in our time about the situation today.

53
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,879
I think if we look at the way coffee consumption is going today,

54
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,639
it seems to me to set out two quite radical alternatives.

55
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:40,879
For the world one is the world of corporate coffee, the coffee change existing on a low wage

56
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,599
economy.

57
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,199
So you have that kind of mass coffee market on the one hand.

58
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,319
On the other hand, you have these micro lotter states, fair trade coffee,

59
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,239
the sort of hipster coffee which is as varied and as interesting as fine wines,

60
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,159
and is made in an artisan way.

61
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:03,919
Many customers today are turning away from large coffee chains like Starbucks

62
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,759
in search of a more responsibly sourced cup of coffee.

63
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:14,319
One example of this is fair trade, an ethical standard scheme which guarantees a fair price for

64
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,639
coffee producers in South America, Africa and Asia.

65
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,319
Another recent development is the use of micro lots.

66
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:28,319
Small plots of land which grow specialised coffee beans prized for their high quality and unique

67
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:35,199
flavour. Fair trade and micro lot coffee are parts of a shift in focus towards quality artisanal

68
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,199
coffee, coffee made by hand in the traditional way by skilled growers.

69
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,079
It's artisanal coffee that's often sold in smaller, independent coffee shops

70
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,399
preferred by trendy hipsters.

71
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:53,439
So coffee in Britain has come a long way from the days it travelled for months by sea,

72
00:04:53,439 --> 00:05:00,240
from far away places like Ethiopia and Java, which reminds me Sam, what was the answer to your question?

73
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,079
Ah, I asked Neil which city gave its name to the first coffee to arrive in Britain in the

74
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,279
1600s.

75
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,719
I guess it was B. Mocha, which happens to be my favourite drink.

76
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,879
Well, you guessed right because that was the correct answer.

77
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,039
You certainly know your coffee, Neil.

78
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,079
Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've used in this programme on the history of coffee,

79
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,399
a drink which can perk you up, give you more energy and make you feel awake.

80
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,159
Many people drink coffee for the caffeine hit, the way caffeine, which is contained in coffee,

81
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,319
stimulates your body and mind.

82
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,519
The effect can be so strong you might have to wean yourself off it,

83
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,560
gradually stop using something which is bad for you.

84
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,759
Fair trade coffee refers to a scheme which ensures that coffee farmers receive a fair price

85
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,919
for growing their product, while a micro lot is a small plot of land specialising in coffee beans

86
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,039
of the very high quality or unique flavour.

87
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:03,759
Finally, artisanal describes something made by artisans, skilled workers who make things by hand

88
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,039
in the traditional way.

89
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,680
Once again, our six minute to wrap.

90
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,840
I'm off to get myself a hot steamy mocha.

91
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,480
Bye for now.

92
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:10,960
Goodbye.
