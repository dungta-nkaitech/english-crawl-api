5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,359
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Sophie.

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,719
And I'm Neil. So Sophie, the subject of today's show is a traction.

7
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:22,640
Do you believe in love at first sight?

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,080
No, I don't. I think it takes time to get to know somebody

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,240
well enough to know if you love them.

10
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:31,679
But I have a friend who says when she saw her husband for the first time.

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,839
Uh, that was before they got married.

12
00:00:33,839 --> 00:00:37,439
That's right. When they met for the first time, that was it.

13
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,119
A bolt out of the blue.

14
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:41,519
And they got married three months later.

15
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:45,200
A bolt out of the blue means something totally unexpected.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,959
Well, that sounds very romantic.

17
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:49,519
And leads me onto today's quiz question.

18
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:54,480
Sophie, what percentage of Americans said they believe in love at first sight?

19
00:00:54,639 --> 00:01:00,640
Is it a 26% b 56% or c 86%?

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,879
I'm not an old romantic like you, Neil.

21
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,479
So I'm going to go for a 26%.

22
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,359
Well, we'll find out later on in the show if you're right to be skeptical or not, Sophie.

23
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,599
And skeptical for those of you who don't know,

24
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,759
means to have doubts about something.

25
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,599
I think you can be physically attracted to somebody straight away.

26
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,359
I just don't think you can fall in love with somebody so easily.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,599
Love is about other things, compatibility, personality, and a good sense of humour.

28
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,959
Yes, humour is important, but apparently Sophie, for men,

29
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:35,359
it's all about the waste hip ratio.

30
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,640
According to research, the ideal waste hip ratio for women is 0.7,

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,799
where ratio means the relationship between two sizes.

32
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,879
And you get this figure by dividing the waste measurement by the hip measurement.

33
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,560
I see.

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,839
And why do men find 0.7 so irresistible?

35
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:59,840
Well, let's listen to Dr Anna Machin, an evolutionary anthropologist from the University of Oxford,

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,079
explaining what a man is looking for.

37
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,719
He's going to look of signs for fertility and what we call for

38
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,240
quantity and good health.

39
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,319
And the major indicator of that in women is the waste hip ratio.

40
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,400
And the waste hip ratio, the absolute ideal, what men find most attractive,

41
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,840
regardless of culture, this has been tested in many different cultures around the world,

42
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,520
is 0.7.

43
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,400
And that's really your classic hourglass figure.

44
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,319
And the reason why that universally is attractive is because it's tied to the health of that

45
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,560
individual. There's a very strong relationship between someone circulating estrogen and

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,719
testosterone. Obviously, we want the estrogen to be high, the testosterone to be low for women

47
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:44,080
to be fertile. And also her general health. So 0.7 is linked to lower risk of heart disease,

48
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,560
lower risk of diabetes and certain sorts of cancers.

49
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:55,200
So a waste hip ratio of 0.7 correlates or has a strong relationship with good general health

50
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,520
and fertility in women. And the men find this attractive because it identifies fertile women,

51
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,480
women who will be able to conceive or get pregnant and have babies successfully.

52
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,200
Dr Machin also mentions that 0.7 is the classic hourglass figure, which means curvy.

53
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,959
Do you like curves, Neil? I'm your own business, Sophie.

54
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,959
But all this waste hip theory of attraction isn't very romantic, is it?

55
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,599
You're right, it isn't. And whilst we do judge people by the way they look,

56
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,799
we also use our senses smell to sniff out our ideal mate or sexual partner.

57
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,439
Apparently, we can detect whether people are genetically different to us,

58
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:41,759
by the way they smell. And parents who have different immune systems create healthier babies.

59
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,280
So it's back to having babies again, all biology and chemistry.

60
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,439
And not about feelings at all.

61
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,239
Well, let's leave chemistry behind for a moment and listen to Professor David Perrett

62
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,120
at the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrew's University in Scotland.

63
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,039
He talks about other factors that play a role in attraction.

64
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,479
Classic surgery really doesn't count for much in the end.

65
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,799
You could be with somebody who's aesthetically very beautiful, but if they don't

66
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,800
smile and react, then that counts for much less.

67
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:20,319
So we can change our faces by interacting with others and doing so in a pleasant manner.

68
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,840
And that will aid our attractiveness and make others interested in us.

69
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,840
What does aesthetically mean, Sophie?

70
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,759
It means judging something by the way it looks.

71
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,960
And whilst we all enjoy a pretty face, most of us are looking for more than that.

72
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:42,959
We are looking for people who appear friendly and approachable and who we share interests with.

73
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:48,239
Exactly. And personally, I think kind eyes are very important with a bit of a twinkle.

74
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:49,759
What about you, Sophie?

75
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,680
I like a good sense of humour.

76
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,439
Very good. Now remember I asked you, Sophie, what percentage of Americans said they believe in love at first sight?

77
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:03,199
Is it a 26% b 56% or c 86%?

78
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,359
I said 26%.

79
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,680
Sorry, that's the wrong answer.

80
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,600
Sophie, 56% of Americans believe in love at first sight.

81
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,759
And the percentage is even higher for married people and those in relationships,

82
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,280
according to a poll conducted by the website cbs.com in 2013.

83
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,600
Well, Americans are a romantic bunch.

84
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,840
Me too. And I'm British.

85
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,600
Now, here are the words we heard today.

86
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,280
Bolt out of the blue.

87
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,800
Skeptical.

88
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,240
Ratio.

89
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,759
Correlates.

90
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,599
Thirtile.

91
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:37,279
Conceive.

92
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,680
Our glass figure.

93
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,360
Mate.

94
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,279
Stethically.

95
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,279
