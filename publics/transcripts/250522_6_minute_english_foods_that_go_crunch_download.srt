2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,519
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English.

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,720
I'm Georgie and I'm Beth.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,160
Georgie, what do apples, carrots and celery

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,600
have in common with insects like beetles,

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,400
crickets and grasshoppers?

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,679
That's a tough one, Beth.

8
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:26,080
I'm going to say, I can fit them all in my backpack.

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,560
OK.

10
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:29,239
Well, the answer is actually,

11
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:32,560
that all examples of foods that crunch.

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,200
There's something very satisfying about the crunch

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,239
when you bite into a fresh apple,

14
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:40,879
a stick of celery or even a roasted beetle.

15
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,600
Yes, that's right.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,959
In some parts of the world,

17
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:46,480
edible insects are crunched too.

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,200
Scientists, Danielle Reid,

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,759
has been exploring our love of crunchy food

20
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,039
for BBC World Service programme, the Food Chain.

21
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:56,200
A crunch of a fresh apple

22
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,160
is nothing better in the world, honestly, to me.

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,240
I grew up as a small child in an apple orchard

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,079
and so we could pick them fresh off the tree.

25
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:07,719
And so I have a very nuanced understanding

26
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:10,040
of the different crunches of apples

27
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,520
and the different types of apples and so, yes,

28
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,400
I really find that to be one of life's real true pleasures.

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,200
Danielle says there's nothing better in the world

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,280
than the crunch of a fresh apple.

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,520
She uses the phrase,

32
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,120
nothing better in the world to emphasise how much she loves it.

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,560
Danielle thinks eating crunchy apples

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,680
is one of life's true pleasures

35
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,079
and experience she finds enjoyable.

36
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:36,080
But why are we so attracted to crunchy food?

37
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,640
That's what we'll be investigating in this programme,

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,960
along with some useful new vocabulary,

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,080
all of which you can find on our website,

40
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,040
bvclearningenglish.com.

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,920
But first, I have a question for you, Georgie.

42
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,000
Like Danielle, many British people enjoy the crunch of an apple.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,520
But according to a 2024 UGF study,

44
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,119
which is the most popular type of apple in the UK?

45
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,079
Is it A, Pink Lady, B, Gala, or C, Red Delicious?

46
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:08,919
I'm going to say A, Pink Lady, because that's my favourite.

47
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,639
Ah, and me.

48
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,479
Okay, we'll find out the answer later in the programme.

49
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:17,680
As well as the satisfying sound of a loud crunch,

50
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,199
the texture of crunchy food is important too.

51
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,199
It tells our bodies to get ready for the raw and rough fiber needed

52
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,319
to develop our chewing muscles and teeth.

53
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,079
And there are other ways in which crunchy food keeps us healthy,

54
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:36,239
as Danielle explains to bvc World Services, the food chain.

55
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,399
The first bite of crunch is the most essential bite,

56
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:42,319
because really when we put something in our mouth,

57
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,639
we don't think about it this way,

58
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,560
but we have to decide whether we're going to swallow, right?

59
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,319
So that first bite gives us a ton of information.

60
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,679
I mean, everybody I think has had the experience

61
00:02:52,679 --> 00:02:54,799
of biting into a mushy apple.

62
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,240
And saying, no, thank you.

63
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,320
So the crunch is telling us about the quality of food,

64
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,200
specifically the high quality of the food.

65
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,640
Yes, or not.

66
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,160
You know, we've also had cases where we've bitten into something

67
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,080
that has a crunch and found an egg shell in our scrambled eggs.

68
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,439
That's no good.

69
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:18,120
When we put food in our mouths, we need to know it's safe.

70
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,920
A loud crunch means this food is fresh and okay to eat.

71
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,839
The crunching sound gives us a ton of information,

72
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:28,359
meaning a lot of information about the food's freshness.

73
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:32,079
Nobody likes biting into an apple which is mushy,

74
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,000
an adjective meaning soft,

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,079
because we understand that that means it's bad to eat.

76
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:40,319
So crunchy food sounds healthy, feels good,

77
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,959
and tells our body it's safe to eat.

78
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,479
No wonder that when astronauts on the International Space Station

79
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,560
were asked what they missed most,

80
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,599
crunchy food topped their list.

81
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,840
But apples and carrots are one thing, Beth.

82
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,560
It's something else to crunch down on insects, isn't it?

83
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,960
Well, not in some countries, Georgie,

84
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,079
a zimbabwe for one, where celebrity chef, Delcy Medecua,

85
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:04,840
uses the crunchy texture of beetles,

86
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,319
termites, and locusts to convince people to try

87
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,919
insect protein as a cheap alternative to meat.

88
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,799
And if you think you could never eat insects,

89
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,000
listen as Delcy explains how she changed her mind

90
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,519
to Ruth Alexander, presenter of BBC World Service Program,

91
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,920
The Food Chain.

92
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,720
So are you an insect convert them?

93
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,240
Oh, no, I am.

94
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,839
I love them as small snacks just roasted with salt,

95
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:34,600
or what I did with most of them is turn them into flowers

96
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,920
and meals so I make them into cakes biscuits.

97
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,959
I grind them together with chicken or beef,

98
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,319
and then turn them into beautiful sausages,

99
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,240
and then that's how I love them.

100
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,439
Ruth asked Delcy if she's an insect convert,

101
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,319
a person who has changed their ideas or way of living.

102
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,120
And Delcy replies, yes, she didn't before,

103
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,439
but now she loves eating roast insects as snacks,

104
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:59,160
small bits of food you eat between meals.

105
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,720
They do sound crunchy,

106
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,600
but I think I'll stick to apples, thanks Georgie.

107
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,920
Well, speaking of apples,

108
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,920
it's time you revealed the answer to your question.

109
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,399
Yes, I asked you, which was the most popular apple

110
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:15,000
according to a survey of people in the UK?

111
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,480
I said, pink lady, didn't I?

112
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,319
You did.

113
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:20,280
And it was the correct answer, well done.

114
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,720
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned

115
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,240
starting with two positive phrases.

116
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,439
Nothing better in the world,

117
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:30,000
which is used to emphasise how much someone enjoys something,

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,360
and one of life's true pleasures,

119
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,439
which describes a particular experience or activity

120
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,480
that someone finds enjoyable.

121
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,360
A turn of something means a lot of something.

122
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,560
If you describe food as mushy, you mean it's soft,

123
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,200
the opposite of crunchy.

124
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,120
A convert is a person who has changed their beliefs

125
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,240
or way of living.

126
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,839
And finally, a snack is a small bit of food

127
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,120
you eat between meals,

128
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,399
for example, crisps or a chocolate bar.

129
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,560
And once again, our six minutes are up,

130
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,199
but if you're ready for more,

131
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,800
just head over to our website,

133
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,199

See you there soon, bye, bye.
