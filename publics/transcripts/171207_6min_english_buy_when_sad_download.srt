6 Minute English from the BBC

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,439
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English.

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,839
I'm Neil and joining me today is Dan,

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,280
who's weighed down with shopping bags and wearing something very...

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,280
Well, strange.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,400
What's going on, Dan?

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,640
Well, I was feeling a bit miserable,

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,640
so I decided to cheer myself up by going shopping.

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,480
Well, that's lucky because the link between shopping and mood

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,120
is what we're looking at in this 6 Minute English.

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,960
And of course, we'll be giving you 6

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,079
mood and shopping-related vocabulary items.

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,520
But first, our quiz.

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,960
Online shoppers in which country spend more per household

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,120
than consumers in any other country,

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,719
according to a report by the UK Cards Association.

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,159
Is it A, the USA, B, Norway or C the UK?

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,280
Hmm. Norway seems to come top of lots of our lists.

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,040
So for that reason alone, I'm going to say Norway.

22
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,920
Well, okay. We'll find out at the end of the show.

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,519
Now, Dan, you said just now that you went shopping

24
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,200
because you were feeling down.

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,079
That's right.

26
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,640
I like a bit of retail therapy.

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,280
Retail therapy is a humorous expression,

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,400
which means going shopping to make yourself feel better.

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,159
Oh, I do that all the time.

30
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,760
Yes, I can see.

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,040
And you're not alone.

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,520
According to some research done by the website

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,200
MoneySupermarket.com,

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,040
people are more likely to buy things

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,840
though later regret when they're feeling sad,

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,359
bored or stressed.

37
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,960
Well, I was feeling a bit down in the dumps.

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,040
And that's a way of saying sad.

39
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,320
Oh, dear, Dan.

40
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,080
Sorry to hear you've been down in the dumps.

41
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,040
I only hope you don't get a pang of regret

42
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,280
about your purchases when you get them home.

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,880
The research suggests that you will.

44
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,519
A pang is a sharp pain.

45
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,679
We often hear it used figuratively

46
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:03,280
to talk about strong emotions like guilt, regret,

47
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,079
and remorse.

48
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,079
And you're making me feel worse, Neil.

49
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,039
Sorry, Dan.

50
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:09,039
It's all for educational purposes.

51
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,280
Our audience will learn from your pain.

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,840
Remorse is like regret.

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,240
And there's a good expression to describe exactly

54
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,560
that bad feeling you get when you realize

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,960
you don't really need or want the things

56
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,319
that you've bought.

57
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,680
Buyer's remorse.

58
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,040
OK, OK, OK.

59
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,480
Enough about me.

60
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,280
Let's hear from Sam, Phil, and Catherine

61
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,560
from the Learning English team

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,400
to see if their mood affects the shopping choices they make.

63
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,840
Listen carefully.

64
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,640
Can you hear the three types of things they say

65
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,840
that they buy when they're down in the dumps?

66
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,120
Honestly, I tend to buy food.

67
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,719
I anything that will bring me comfort.

68
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,319
So it can be any sort of warm drink, hot drink,

69
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,759
but also anything warm and cozy, so like a nice jumper.

70
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,959
Definitely if I've had a bad day at work

71
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,519
or for whatever reason, I feel terrible tired.

72
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,319
I am more likely to buy something on the way home.

73
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:09,280
Oh, when I'm feeling sad, I probably buy a little bit of wine

74
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,120
and often something to wear.

75
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,799
I find that a bit of retail therapy when I'm sad.

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,400
Usually does the trick at the time,

77
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
so it makes me feel better,

78
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,400
but I do find that when I look at my wardrobe,

79
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,840
the things that I bought when I was sad, I never wear them.

80
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,920
Sam, Phil, and Catherine there from the BBC Learning English team

81
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,599
talking about what kind of things they buy when they're feeling down.

82
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,719
What were they?

83
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:37,200
Food, drink, and clothes.

84
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,159
Yes, that's right.

85
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,080
Sam mentioned she buys food, warm drinks, and a nice jumper

86
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,680
to keep her cozy.

87
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,800
That's the feeling of being warm, comfortable and relaxed.

88
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,160
Catherine also mentioned drinks this time wine,

89
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,439
and she also said that buying clothes does the trick.

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,520
That means achieves the result she intended.

91
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,840
But what's interesting is that Catherine said she never wears the clothes she buys

92
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,520
when she's feeling sad.

93
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,520
That's exactly what the survey found.

94
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,960
People regret the purchases they make when they're sad,

95
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,320
bored or stressed.

96
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,280
Hmm, sounds like a case of buyer's remorse.

97
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,480
It does indeed.

98
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,439
Well, time now for the answer to our quiz question.

99
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:18,159
I asked this.

100
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,800
Online shoppers in which country spend more per household

101
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
than consumers in any other country,

102
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,159
according to a report from the UK Cards Association.

103
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:32,800
Is it A, the USA, B, Norway, and C the UK?

104
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,199
And I said B, Norway.

105
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,439
And I'm afraid you might need to go and buy some more stuff to cheer you up.

106
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,159
You're wrong.

107
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,719
The correct answer is the UK.

108
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,680
Apparently, UK households spent the equivalent of

109
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,880
4,611 pounds.

110
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,240
That's almost $6,000 using payment cards online in 2015.

111
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,200
Well, I hope they were happy when they made those purchases

112
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,280
or they may feel the pang of regret.

113
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,720
I'm scared I might get after today's discussion.

114
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,800
Well, a good recap of the vocabulary from this program might do the trick.

115
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,320
Shall we start with the first word?

116
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,080
Do you ever go in for a bit of retail therapy, Neil?

117
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:15,839
Actually, I try to avoid it, especially after reading this survey.

118
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,079
I don't think the happiness you feel after buying something last very long.

119
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:23,120
In fact, you can end up feeling down in the dumps.

120
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,959
Yes, down in the dumps, meaning sad or unhappy.

121
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:33,199
And a pang of regret might follow once you realize you spend a lot of money on something

122
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,799
you don't really need.

123
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:39,439
A pang is a stab used here figuratively to mean a sharp pain.

124
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,519
Used to talk about strong emotions.

125
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,399
And after that pang can come buyers remorse.

126
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,959
I'm beginning to feel buyers remorse from this leopard skin onesie.

127
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,439
It seemed like such a good idea at the time.

128
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,399
It does look cosy at least.

129
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,480
That's warm, comfortable and relaxed.

130
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,000
So I think if that's what you wanted, it does the trick.

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,439
Does the trick, meaning achieves the results you wanted?

132
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,519
Please remember to check out our Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages.

133
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,159
Bye-bye.

134
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:08,639
Goodbye.
