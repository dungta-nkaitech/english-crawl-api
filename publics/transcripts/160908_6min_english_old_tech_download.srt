00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:14,880
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,839
And I'm Neil.

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,879
We're talking about old technology today, Neil.

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:23,039
Did you use to have any old tech, you know, a Walkman back in the 1990s

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,560
before music went digital?

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,320
No, I didn't have a Walkman, but I do have a record player.

11
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,320
I know you like flaired trousers, but I didn't realise you were that retro.

12
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,719
A record player, for those of you who don't know, is a box with a turn table or turning plate

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,679
that you put your vinyl records on to play them.

14
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,120
And retro means going back to styles and fashions from the past.

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,600
Well, I love my record player.

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,439
I have a large collection of vinyl records as well as cassette tapes that I inherited from my parents.

17
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,719
Vinyl is the plastic that records are made from.

18
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,079
And cassette tapes came after records, which are these small plastic cases with

19
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,319
audio tape on reels inside them.

20
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,640
Well, I don't understand your fondness for outdated stuff, Neil.

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,359
Don't be so quick to dismiss old tech, Alice.

22
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:17,039
There's been a resurgence or new rise in record sales recently here in the UK and in the US.

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,920
Some DJs have gone back to using them.

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,280
And new record stores have opened to meet the demand for vinyl.

25
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,239
Really?

26
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,200
Yes, really.

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,200
In fact, I have a question for you, Alice.

28
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,680
How many records were sold in the UK in 2014?

29
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,439
Was it A, 10,000, B, 100,000 or C, 1 million?

30
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,599
Well, I think it's B, 100,000.

31
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,560
We'll find out if you're right or wrong later in the show.

32
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,079
For myself, I just think vinyl sounds nicer than digital.

33
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,840
Has a warmer quality.

34
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,920
That sounds a bit technical, Neil.

35
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,840
Don't you think this retro trend has more to do with nostalgia for the past?

36
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,719
Nostalgia means thinking about the past with a mixture of warm feelings and sadness.

37
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,080
Well, yes, I think people who grew up with the old technology probably are nostalgia

38
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,039
about it.

39
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,960
Let's listen to music journalist Jacqueline Springer talking about cassette tapes and what they mean to her.

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,960
They were all dear love letters.

41
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,400
There were ways in which she started to carve out your own identity.

42
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
So, you know, when Dan and I interviewed people, we talked about,

43
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,600
we talked to musicians about their impressions and their influences and invariably

44
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,640
it was siblings or parents and you would raid those vinyl albums and you'd self-select.

45
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,840
Jacqueline Springer there.

46
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,240
So she calls cassette tapes audio love letters because people often compiled or put together

47
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,800
their own collection of songs on tapes and gave them to the boy or girl they liked.

48
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:56,240
Jacqueline says they recorded songs from their parents record collections onto tape

49
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,800
and it seems that this process helped create their musical and social identity.

50
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,920
Yes, I identified with the Rolling Stones, the Clash, the Sex Pistols when I was a teen.

51
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,240
How about your musical identity Alice?

52
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:14,160
Well, I was in love with all the boy bands from the 1990s, NSYNC, Westlife, Backstreet Boys,

53
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:20,719
take that? Unbelievable. I can see I need to make you some decent tapes of music from the 90s, Alice.

54
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:27,599
I didn't say I still like boy bands, Neil. I'm not nostalgic for my lost teenage years, unlike you.

55
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,439
Old tech is everywhere. Did you know that the US nuclear weapons force still uses a computer system

56
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,280
dating back to the 1970s with eight-inch floppy disks?

57
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,840
Floppy disks. You mean those flexible plastic computer disks used for storing data magnetically?

58
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,639
Well, I can't believe the guys in the Pentagon are nostalgic about floppy disks.

59
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:53,599
Well, a Pentagon spokesperson said it would be extremely expensive to update the system

60
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,960
and it still works. They plan to do it by 2020 and save a lot of space for sure.

61
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:05,840
You would need more than 130,000 eight-inch floppy disks to store 32 gigabytes of information.

62
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,439
Wow, that is the equivalent of an average memory stick.

63
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,639
Yes, but there are more people out there keen on old tech.

64
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:18,560
How do you think a DVD rental store survives in this era of online movie streaming?

65
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,879
Let's listen to Tara Judah, a co-director of UK rental store 20th century flicks and find out.

66
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,879
We've survived because of the experience of coming into this store.

67
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,719
It's a very human experience. It's human interaction. People come here because they want to talk

68
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:41,919
to somebody who's really knowledgeable about film. They want to have a recommendation or a

69
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,640
conversation about the films they've just watched. They really want to discuss those things.

70
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,680
So it's back to the idea of human contact. We like compiling lists of music and sharing them

71
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,200
with our friends and loved ones, sharing a playlist through iTunes or Spotify isn't quite the same

72
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,800
though. We like talking to people about the films we watch. You can always talk to me, Neil.

73
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,040
Now, how about giving me the answer to today's quiz question?

74
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:18,160
I asked how many records were sold in the UK in 2014. Was it A, 10,000, B, 100,000 or C, 1 million?

75
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:26,240
And I said B, 100,000. And Alice, you are, in fact, totally wrong.

76
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:35,360
Oh! The answer is C. Vinyl is booming. In 2014, sales passed 1 million albums in the UK for the first time

77
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,439
since 1996. The format has been steadily increasing thanks in part to the popularity of

78
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:48,720
guitar bands traditionally associated with records. Now, let's hear the words we learned today. They are

79
00:05:49,439 --> 00:06:04,560
record player, turntable, retro, vinyl, cassette tapes, resurgence, nostalgia, compiled, floppy disc,

80
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,879
well that's the end of today's 6 Minute English. Don't forget to join us again soon. Bye bye!
