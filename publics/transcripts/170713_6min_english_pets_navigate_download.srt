00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,000
Welcome to 6 Minute English, the program where we bring you an interesting topic

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,800
and six useful words or phrases. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,120
And I'm Dan. Today we're talking about one of the last mysteries of science.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,280
No, not if the universe will keep expanding forever, but this.

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,040
How do cats and dogs find their way home over long distances?

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,200
We hear incredible stories of lost pets, traveling tens and even hundreds of miles home,

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,400
but scientists struggle to explain how they do it.

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,920
We'll hear the view of one scientist today, but before that I have to ask an important question.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,560
Neil, are you a cat person or a dog person?

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,359
Oh, that's easy. I'm a cat person for sure. Dogs are just... well they're hard work, aren't they?

14
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,200
If you say you're a cat person, it means you prefer cats.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,920
A coffee person prefers coffee.

16
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,680
A something person likes or prefers that thing, often over another thing.

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,920
Back to the topic, I'm a cat person. Can you answer this, Dan?

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,560
Recently, a cat called Omar made headlines for being possibly the world's longest cat.

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,879
How long is Omar?

20
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:23,599
Is it a 120 cm?

21
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,159
B, 80 cm or C, 180 cm.

22
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,439
I'm going to say C, 180 cm.

23
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,519
Now, from long cats to long distance cats, scientists were scratching their heads a couple of years ago

24
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,359
when a lost cat called Holly traveled 200 miles to get home.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,439
How did it do it?

26
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,439
We say scratch your head when you're confused about something.

27
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,199
There are a few theories about how cats and dogs navigate, but we don't yet have the full answer.

28
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:58,640
Well, both cats and dogs have an extremely powerful sense of smell, of course.

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,640
Smells are like signposts. They let you know where you are.

30
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,679
Visual landmarks also play a role just as they do with humans.

31
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:13,039
A landmark is something very easily recognised, a big building or mountain, for example.

32
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,039
And what about this one?

33
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,919
Magnets are pieces of metal which attract certain other kinds of metal, for example,

34
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,359
iron or steel.

35
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:24,399
The earth itself has a magnetic force.

36
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:28,079
Birds use it to help them navigate over thousands of miles.

37
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,919
It tells them where north is.

38
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,799
It's thought they have some iron in their beaks.

39
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:36,879
But some scientists think mammals also have this capability.

40
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,879
So, we have a few ideas.

41
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:45,919
Smell, landmarks, magnetic forces, but can we explain how one kitty travelled over 200 miles

42
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:48,079
by itself back to its home?

43
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,760
Let's hear from Cat and Dog expert Dr. John Bradshaw.

44
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,320
How do cats build up the maps in their heads?

45
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,600
What they do when they are in a new territory is explore it in a very systematic way.

46
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,320
So they'll go out in ever-increasing circles.

47
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,080
They'll literally construct a mental map in their heads.

48
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,840
And so a cat that's lost its territory probably does the same thing.

49
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,200
They'll rely on the idea that if they go out in ever-increasing circles or rectangles,

50
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,719
then eventually they will either come across the territory or they'll come across a smell

51
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,399
carried on the wind of the territory that they used to live in and then be able to get home.

52
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,439
Cats have a systematic approach, which means they use a system which is.

53
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,719
First, they walk around their area in a small circle, then a bigger one,

54
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,719
and then a bigger one, until they have a strong mental map of the place.

55
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,799
Yes, a mental map is a map in your head, stored in your memory,

56
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,520
and the area cats explore, their home area, is called their territory.

57
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,160
Cats are territorial, which means their territory is very important to them.

58
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,560
Having a map is great, but what happens when a cat gets lost?

59
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,200
Dr Bradshaw says that again, it moves around in bigger and bigger circles until it finds a

60
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,960
clue, which is a landmark or a smell that tells it where it is.

61
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,520
Well, that's the theory.

62
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,200
Though Dr Bradshaw says we really still don't have enough data,

63
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
that's enough information about this.

64
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,319
When there is a scientific breakthrough, we'll bring it to you in six minute English, I hope.

65
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:25,280
For now, let's content ourselves with Omar, possibly the world's longest cat.

66
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,480
How long then, Dan?

67
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,800
I said 180 centimeters.

68
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,079
Omar measures 120 centimeters.

69
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,040
That's over two-thirds of my height and weighs a heavy 14 kilograms.

70
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,360
Well, one thing, Neil, if Omar ever got lost, he'd be found in no time.

71
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,480
He's a landmark in himself, which reminds me, let's run through today's words again.

72
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,040
If you're a cat person, you prefer cats.

73
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,240
If you're an evening person, you prefer evenings.

74
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,480
I've always thought you were a kind person, Neil.

75
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,520
Nice of you to say, but we only use the phrase with nouns, not adjectives.

76
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,320
Indeed.

77
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,800
We don't want listeners to be scratching their heads.

78
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,560
No, we can't confuse them.

79
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,040
So let's explain the next one clearly.

80
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,160
A landmark is something easily recognizable that lets you know where you are.

81
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,319
The bridges in London are landmarks.

82
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,720
And can we say the parks are magnets in summer?

83
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,879
A magnet is a piece of metal that attracts iron and steel,

84
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,000
but we can also use the word more widely to describe things that attract other things.

85
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,079
Two more words.

86
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,600
Territory is a noun.

87
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,360
The area of land that an animal considers to be its own.

88
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Animals who feel this strongly are described as territorial.

89
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,840
Humans can be too about land or subjects they feel they own or control.

90
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,560
And finally, systematic.

91
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,400
The adjective from system.

92
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,840
We can talk about a systematic approach, a systematic solution,

93
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,199
a systematic study.

94
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,360
And we have systematically worked our way through all of today's words.

95
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,400
Very good, which means it's time to mention our own online territory.

96
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,319
Our website and social media pages.

97
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,680

99
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,439
Bye bye for now. Goodbye.
