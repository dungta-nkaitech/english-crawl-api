00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:12,880
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:20,719
And I'm Beth. Plastic is fantastic. This phrase was used a lot in the 1950s when mass-produced

4
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:26,640
plastic items started to become part of our everyday lives. The following decades saw

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,640
a revolution as plastic became the most commonly used material in modern life, found in everything

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,719
from cars to furniture to packaging. Take a quick look around and you'll soon see how many

7
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:46,159
everyday items contain plastic. But now our love of plastic is being questioned. Mostly

8
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:51,760
thanks to climate change and pollution caused by single-use plastics. Plastic products

9
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:57,640
which are designed to be used just once before being thrown away. 11 million tons of

10
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,679
plastic waste are dumped into our oceans every year. It's believed that single-use plastics

11
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,359
make up 40% of all plastic pollution globally.

12
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:14,159
What's more, it's not just land and water being polluted. Tiny plastic pieces, known

13
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,280
as microbeads, have even been found inside the human body and can be passed from mother

14
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,120
to child through breast milk. And because plastic comes from fossil fuels, the process of

15
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:33,280
making it creates problems at every stage, from burning coal to transportation to recycling.

16
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,319
In this programme we'll be asking, is it time to live without plastic? And as usual,

17
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:42,840
we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

18
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,280
But first I have a question for you, Beth. One reason why plastic became so popular is

19
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,159
that it's a very flexible material. It can be formed into different shapes, making it

20
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,840
useful for keeping food fresh or holding liquid. Originally, plastic was invented to replace

21
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,480
the decreasing supply of natural materials like metal, wood and glass. So which items

22
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:12,960
did plastic first replace? Was it A, snooker balls, B, shopping bags or C, hairbrushes?

23
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,560
Hmm, I guess the first thing to be made of plastic was a hairbrush.

24
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,280
Okay, Beth, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

25
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,319
Dr Sherry Mason is Professor of Chemistry at Penn State University in the US and a specialist

26
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:34,280
in plastic pollution. Her award-winning 2017 research into microplastics in rivers led

27
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,879
to the US Congress banning microbeads. Here she explains the problem of plastics to BBC

28
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:49,280
World Service programme, the real story. Plastic is synthetic and as a consequence of that,

29
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,479
nature doesn't really know what to do with it. Like a paper bag that's sitting on the

30
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:58,439
side of the road, it's unsightly but within weeks there are organisms in the soil that

31
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:04,759
can use that paper bag as a food source, right? They have evolved to basically chew up

32
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:10,759
that paper bag and turn it back into soil, turn it back into carbon and nitrogen and oxygen.

33
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:16,560
But with regard to plastic because it is a synthetic material, you don't have that evolution.

34
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,239
There are some organisms that can use it as a food source but there are few and far between,

35
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,959
especially when you're talking about water systems, aquatic systems and the temperatures

36
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,879
that exist. And so they can't really use it as a food source. So plastic doesn't buy

37
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:38,719
to grade and... Plastic is a synthetic material, meaning that it's made by combining man-made

38
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:45,639
chemicals instead of existing naturally. Natural materials like paper decay and harmlessly

39
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:52,759
turn back into soil, they buy or degrade, but plastic is not like this. It doesn't decay

40
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:58,599
and get broken down by microbes and bacteria. In fact, some plastic eating microbes and bacteria

41
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:05,120
do exist but these are few and far between. They're rare. They don't happen very often.

42
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,120
It's the fact that plastic doesn't decay which is responsible for the waste we see in the environment,

43
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,719
waste which is often unsightly, meaning ugly and unpleasant to look at.

44
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:20,120
Fortunately, help is at hand. The plastic eating microbes Neil mentioned,

45
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:26,120
especially one called Rodococus Ruber, have been tested by scientists and seem capable

46
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:32,319
of breaking down plastic into its basic components. What's also needed is an emphasis

47
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:37,319
on reducing plastic production, especially packaging and other single-use products,

48
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:44,319
rather than simply recycling. Action like this should help plastic achieve its original purpose,

49
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:50,319
to help preserve not pollute our natural resources. And speaking of the origins of plastic,

50
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,319
isn't it time to reveal the answer to your question Neil?

51
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:59,319
Right, I asked you which object made of natural materials was the first to be replaced by plastic.

52
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:04,319
You said it was a hairbrush, which was the wrong answer I'm afraid Beth.

53
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:11,319
In fact, the first plastic molding machine was used in 1872 to produce snooker balls.

54
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:17,319
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this program, starting with single-use plastics,

55
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:22,319
plastic products which are designed to be used just once before being thrown away.

56
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:28,319
Microbedes are tiny plastic particles found in products like toothpaste and body scrubs,

57
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,319
which can enter and pollute rivers, seas and the human body.

58
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:38,319
The adjective synthetic describes a non-natural material made by combining chemicals.

59
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:44,319
To biodegrade means to decay naturally, in a way that is not harmful to the environment.

60
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:49,319
The phrase few and far between means very rare or not happening very often.

61
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:56,319
And finally, if something is described as unsightly, it's ugly and unpleasant to look at.

62
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,319
Once again, our six minutes are up.

Goodbye.
