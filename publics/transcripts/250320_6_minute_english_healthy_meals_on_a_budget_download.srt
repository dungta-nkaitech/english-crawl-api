00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,400
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Pippa.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,359
And I'm Georgie. In this programme, we're talking about saving money on food.

4
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,559
Pippa, are you good at saving money on your food shop?

5
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:26,240
I think I'm quite good. I plan what I like to cook, so I don't waste money in the supermarket.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,519
How about you Georgie?

7
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,439
I'm not very good. I usually go to the supermarket when I'm hungry, so I end up buying lots of snacks.

8
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:39,439
Oh, that's a terrible idea. Well, in this programme, we'll be learning about one way to save money

9
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:45,200
on the food we eat. But first, I've got a question for you Georgie. The most expensive restaurant

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,519
in the world is thought to be a restaurant called Sublimotion in Ibiza, which only has 12 customers

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,880
each night. But how much in euros is a meal per person at the restaurant?

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:05,439
A, 650 euros? B, 1600 and 50 euros? Or C, 2650 euros?

13
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:11,520
The most expensive I'll go with C, 2650 euros.

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,359
Well, we'll find out the answer at the end of the programme. Now, food in the UK is getting

15
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,480
more expensive as it has been in many parts of the world, and some people are struggling to

16
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:28,239
afford their food shopping. But BBC World Service programme People Fixing the World has been

17
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:33,680
finding out about a project called Bags of Taste, which helps people save money on their food

18
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,519
shopping and improve their diet at the same time. Bags of something is an informal way to say

19
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:45,200
a lot of something. The founder of Bags of Taste, Alicia Weston, became concerned that people in the

20
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,400
UK with less money found it difficult to afford a healthy diet. People in poverty are

21
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,799
eating the worst diets, and they are getting sicker younger. And we know that diets are the

22
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,240
single largest cause of health inequalities in the UK. Alicia found that people didn't know how to

23
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,760
cook the kinds of meals they'd like to eat, and they couldn't afford to experiment. Imagine spending

24
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,560
lots of money on ingredients and then wasting them by cooking them badly or burning the food.

25
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:18,080
People also thought making healthy food would be too expensive and take too much time.

26
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,199
So, ultimately we've been able to come up with a programme that basically can tackle all of

27
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:28,640
these issues. So, what we do now is we deliver all the ingredients to their door, because ultimately

28
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,840
behaviour change starts with actually changing your behaviour at home.

29
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,759
Alicia says that ultimately she's been able to come up with a solution to help people save money

30
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,000
on healthy food. We can use the adverb ultimately to mean finally after a series of events have

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,679
happened. Alicia wants to tackle the things that stop people eating healthy food on a budget.

32
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:55,120
If you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it. Alicia's solution involves delivering

33
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,000
ingredients and recipes to people, and then using a WhatsApp group to talk to participants.

34
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:04,479
Each WhatsApp group has a mentor who shares cooking tips and advice.

35
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:09,519
To give you an idea of how this works, the team at People Fixing the World read out some

36
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,560
of the messages on one of the bags of taste WhatsApp chats.

37
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:22,000
Remember to put the fridge bag in the fridge. Can we aim to cook recipe one by Tuesday evening?

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,639
Our first recipe, chana masala, is a classic. It needs an onion which can be a pain to chop,

39
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,000
so try our way.

40
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,159
Video posted.

41
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,360
Ellie.

42
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,400
Love this method.

43
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,680
Chef emoji.

44
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,120
First time I've chopped an onion like this and it's so neat and easy.

45
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,240
Georgia.

46
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,199
I'm going to cook mine tomorrow, looking forward to it.

47
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,159
Ellie.

48
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,240
I finished making my chana masala.

49
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,719
I was a bit too heavy handed with the chili.

50
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,080
My husband likes a lot of spice, so I'd reduce that next time.

51
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:58,240
The mentor in the group, Amy, describes the recipe for chana masala as a classic.

52
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:03,200
We call something a classic to say that it is well known and of good quality.

53
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,680
We can also describe a particular book, film or song as a classic.

54
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,480
Amy sends a video to show a technique for cutting onions, which she describes as a pain to chop.

55
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,920
If something is a pain to do, it is difficult or annoying to do.

56
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,240
One of the participants, Ali, said that when she made the chana masala,

57
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,639
she was a bit heavy handed with the chili.

58
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,039
If you are heavy handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it.

59
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:31,839
And so Ali's chana masala was very spicy.

60
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:38,560
Bags of taste helps people learn new recipes and cook healthy food without spending too much money.

61
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,199
It's certainly a lot cheaper than a meal at the restaurant in my question, Georgia.

62
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,399
I asked you how much it costs for a meal at sublimation, thought to be the most expensive

63
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,839
restaurant in the world.

64
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,319
Yes, I said a meal was 2650 euros.

65
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,199
Well, you were wrong. It's actually 1,650 euros, but I think that's still pretty expensive.

66
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,560
It definitely is.

67
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,120
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt starting with bags of, which means a lot of something.

68
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,399
We can use the adverb ultimately to say finally after a series of events.

69
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,719
If you tackle a problem, you try to deal with it and find a solution.

70
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:24,560
If we describe something like a recipe as a classic, we mean it's well known and of good quality.

71
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,480
If something is a pain to do, it is annoying or difficult to do.

72
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,360
And if you are heavy-handed with an ingredient, you use too much of it.

73
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,519
For example, I made some soup the other day and I was a bit heavy-handed with the salt.

74
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,120
It tasted disgusting.

75
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,639
Oh, that's not very good.

76
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,879
Okay, once again, our six minutes are up, but you can test what you've learned with the

77
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,680
interactive quiz on our website. Visit VBCLearningEnglish.com.

78
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,480
Bye for now.

79
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:50,879
Bye.
