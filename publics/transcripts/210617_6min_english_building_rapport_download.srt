00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,359
And I'm Georgina.

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,240
Georgina and I have got to know each other very well after working together for so long.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,719
I know what sandwiches Neil has for lunch.

9
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:28,800
Egan tomato right, Neil?

10
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,200
And I know it really annoys Georgina when people don't wash up their cups in the staff kitchen.

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,880
So unhygienic.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,000
But just as important as getting to know someone socially or at work is getting on with people.

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,920
To get on with someone is a useful phrasal verb, meaning to like someone and enjoy a friendly

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,040
relationship with them.

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,120
Which is really important if you work with them every day.

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,159
And there's another word to describe the good understanding and communication between two friends.

17
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,759
Rappore.

18
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:05,759
Yes, how you build rapport and get on with people has been the subject of many self-help books over the years.

19
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:07,759
And is the topic of this programme.

20
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:13,759
Well, you and I must have great rapport, Georgina, because that leads perfectly into my quiz question.

21
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:20,560
In 1936, American writer Dale Carnegie wrote a famous self-help book on building rapport.

22
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,759
It sold over 30 million copies, making it one of the best-selling books of all time.

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,520
But what was it called?

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,880
Is it A, how to get rich quick?

25
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,960
B, how to stop worrying and make friends or C, how to win friends and influence people.

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,000
Hmm, I think I know this Neil.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm going to say C, how to win friends and influence people.

28
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,400
Okay, Georgina, we'll find out if that's right at the end of the programme.

29
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,920
When it comes to getting on with people, psychologist Emily Allison has a few ideas.

30
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,040
She's built a career working with the police as a build rapport with criminal suspects.

31
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,320
Emily is the author of a new book, Rappore, the four ways to read people.

32
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,080
And she told BBC Radio 4 programme all in the mind, it isn't easy to get along with everyone.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,920
I often describe rapport building in relationships as like walking a tightrope,

34
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:24,479
because you really do need to maintain that balance of being objective, treating people with

35
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:30,479
compassion. But that doesn't mean I'm sympathetic, I'm collusive. It's that balance between

36
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:37,599
judgment and avoidance. Emily describes rapport building as like walking a tightrope,

37
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,839
an idiom to describe being in a difficult situation which requires carefully considering what to do.

38
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:47,439
Building rapport with terrorists or violent criminals isn't easy.

39
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:53,039
Emily doesn't sympathise with what they've done, but she tries to remain objective to base her

40
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:59,599
judgement on the facts, not personal feelings. In her book, Emily identifies four main communication

41
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,279
styles, which she names after animals. The best at building rapport is the friendly and cooperative

42
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:10,879
monkey. And there's a pair of opposites, the bossy lion who wants to take charge and control things

43
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:17,839
and the more passive mouse. Here's Emily talking to BBC Radio 4s all in the mind about the fourth

44
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,200
animal, the T-Rex. Try to listen out for the communication style of this personality.

45
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,039
You've got the T-Rex, which is conflict, so this is argument, whether you're approaching it from

46
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:38,800
a positive position where you can be direct, frank, about your message, or you approach that in a

47
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:45,680
negative way by being attacking judgmental argumentative sarcastic, that that actually

48
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,480
breeds the same behaviour back. So anyone who has teenagers will 100% recognise that.

49
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,280
If you meet sarcasm with sarcasm, it's only going to go one way.

50
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,920
All four communication styles have good and bad points. On the positive side,

51
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,640
T-Rex type people are frank, they express themselves in an open, honest way.

52
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,200
But T-Rex types can also be sarcastic, so the opposite of what they really mean,

53
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,800
in order to hurt someone's feelings or criticise them in a funny way.

54
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:25,360
Yes, sarcasm is a strange thing, like saying, oh, I really like your haircut, when in fact you don't.

55
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,560
Yes, there's an English saying that sarcasm is the lowest form of humour,

56
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,839
but I think British people can be quite sarcastic at times.

57
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,959
Well, I can't imagine you'd make many friends being rude to people, maybe they should

58
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,279
read Dale Carnegie's self-help book.

59
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:44,719
Ah, yes, your quiz question, Neil. Was my answer right?

60
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:51,119
In my quiz question, I asked Georgina for the title of Dale Carnegie's best-selling self-help book

61
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:57,839
about building rapport. What did you say? I said the book is called See, How to Win Friends and Influence

62
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:03,599
People. Which is the correct answer, and I guess you've read it, Georgina, because you have lots of

63
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:10,079
friends. I hope you're not being sarcastic, Neil. Absolutely not. I'm not a sarcastic T-Rex type,

64
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:15,120
more of a friendly monkey. Okay, well, let's stay friends and recap the vocabulary from this

65
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,199
programme, starting with rapport, a good feeling between two people based on understanding and

66
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:27,120
communication. If you get on with someone, you like and enjoy a friendly relationship with them.

67
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,799
Walking a tightrope means to be in a difficult situation which requires careful consideration of what

68
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:38,240
to do. To be objective is to base your actions on facts rather than personal feelings.

69
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,079
When building rapport with someone, it's good to be frank. To express yourself in an open, honest

70
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:49,519
way. But not sarcastic, to say the opposite of what you really mean in order to hurt someone's

71
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:55,040
feelings or criticise them in a humorous way. Well, Neil, if we run over six minutes, we'll break
