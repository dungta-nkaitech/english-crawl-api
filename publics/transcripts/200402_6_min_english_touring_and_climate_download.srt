From BBC Learning English

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,519
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,800
And I'm Rob.

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,920
Rob, I've been reading about ways to protect the environment and I've decided to eat less meat

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,560
and maybe drive my car less, too.

9
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:28,160
Well, good for you, Neil.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,839
And flying less can also help reduce air pollution.

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,359
Right, flying and driving less are two good ways to combat climate change

12
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:39,920
because they reduce your carbon footprint.

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,320
That's the amount of carbon dioxide or CO2 released into the atmosphere

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,960
as a result of your everyday activities.

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,359
The idea of reducing carbon emissions is catching on in a music industry, too.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,120
Bands and artists who go on tour around the world

17
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:57,759
generate large carbon footprints.

18
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,919
So recently, some music groups, like Massive Attack and Green Day,

19
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:07,039
started thinking about ways to reduce the impact their tours are having on the environment.

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,920
Green Day, what a good name for a band trying to be environmentally friendly.

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,359
Today, we'll be finding out about bands and musicians who want to continue going on tour,

22
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,200
but do it in ways which reduce their environmental impact.

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,640
And of course, we'll be learning some related vocabulary on the way.

24
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,120
So it seems like the days of rock and roll stars flying around the world in private jets

25
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,200
may soon be a thing of the past.

26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,160
Indeed, Rob.

27
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,719
And that brings me neatly to my quiz question.

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,040
One British band recently announced they would stop going on tour

29
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,360
until they were 100% carbon neutral, but which band?

30
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,920
Was it A, the 1975, B, the Rolling Stones or C, Cold Play?

31
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,519
Well, Cold Play had a hit with their song, The Scientist,

32
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,879
and we are talking about carbon dioxide and the climate.

33
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:01,519
So I'll say C, Cold Play.

34
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,560
Good thinking, Rob. We'll find out the answer later.

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,039
But first, let's hear from another artist concerned about her carbon impact.

36
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,879
Faye Milton is the drummer of the band Savages and co-founder of the Climate Pressure Group,

37
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,199
Music Declare's Emergency.

38
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,800
She spoke to BBC Radio 4's program, You and Yours.

39
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,840
This year, I have actually turned down a tour.

40
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,320
My income comes from touring, so it has put me in a bit of a precarious situation.

41
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,400
But I actually feel quite good about it.

42
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,719
It feels like the right thing to do in this moment.

43
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:38,560
Even though Faye earns a living as a drummer by going on tour,

44
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,920
she has started to turn them down, meaning to reject or refuse the offer of touring.

45
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,760
Losing the income she usually gets from touring puts Faye in a precarious situation.

46
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,799
A situation where things could become difficult.

47
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:58,399
In this case, financially difficult, because she isn't making money from playing the drums.

48
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:00,879
But she still wants to do the right thing.

49
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,199
In other words, do what is most fair, ethical and just.

50
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,680
For Faye, fighting climate change is even more important than doing what she loves,

51
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,599
going on tour with the band.

52
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,239
Well, good for her. I'm not sure if I'd be so committed as Faye.

53
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,640
But if bands stop touring altogether,

54
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,280
fans wouldn't get to see gigs or live concerts and hear the music they love.

55
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,719
Well, that's an interesting point, because it might be possible for bands to carry on touring

56
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,320
and also reduce their environmental impact at the same time.

57
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,719
Bristol band Massive Attack want to do exactly that.

58
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,120
Their singer, Robert Dalnaya, explains.

59
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,080
We're working with an electric bus company.

60
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,920
We're going to look at all the energy being renewable,

61
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,879
and obviously the power we can create will go back to the grid.

62
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,159
So we're hoping that we can actually create legacy green infrastructure,

63
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,839
which can then power future gigs.

64
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,399
We plan to travel to Europe,

65
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:57,439
a solely by train with the band, the crew and all the gear.

66
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,759
Swapping tour planes for trains and encouraging fans to travel to gigs by bus

67
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,319
are two good ways to reduce the total carbon footprint of the concert.

68
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,079
And by using renewable energy, the gig can create power.

69
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,199
This can then be put back into the national grid, called the grid for short.

70
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,480
That's the network supplying electrical power across a country.

71
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,680
Well, Massive Attack are certainly ticking all the green boxes, Neil.

72
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,759
But who else is doing a good job?

73
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,759
Remember your quiz question earlier?

74
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,600
Ah, yes. I asked which band has decided to stop touring,

75
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,840
until their tours were carbon neutral.

76
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,639
And you said,

77
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,800
I said, see cold play.

78
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,280
And you were right. Are you a cold play fan, Rob?

79
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,359
Just remember to leave your car at home the next time you go to one of their gigs.

80
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,639
Right. Okay. Well, today we've been looking at some of the ways music bands and artists

81
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,959
are trying to fight climate change.

82
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,439
They want to reduce their carbon footprint,

83
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,839
the amount of carbon they release into the air.

84
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:03,119
Some musicians are starting to turn down or refuse long world tour dates

85
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:08,000
because flying from country to country, playing gigs or live musical concerts,

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,399
generates so much carbon dioxide.

87
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,079
Bands like savages, green day and massive attack

88
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,759
are trying to do the right thing.

89
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,519
Taking the most fair and ethical course of action,

90
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,519
even though for some artists,

91
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:27,120
the income lost from not touring puts them in a precarious or difficult situation.

92
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,639
But when they get it right,

93
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,919
bands can be carbon neutral or even generate power,

94
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,639
which can be put back into the national grid,

95
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,079
the network supplying electrical power across a country.

96
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:42,240
All of which means we can keep on rocking into the next century

97
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,159
without increasing carbon emissions and adding to climate change.

98
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:49,919
So Rob, you could say you were born to run on renewable energy.

99
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:54,000
Very funny, Neil. Well, that's all for today,

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,680
but remember to join us again soon for more topical discussions

102

103
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:04,879
Bye-bye.
