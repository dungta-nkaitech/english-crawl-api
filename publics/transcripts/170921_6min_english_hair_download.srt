5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,919
Welcome to 6 Minute English.

6
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:16,800
Where today we introduce a hair raising topic

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,199
and six items of vocabulary.

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,240
I'm Tim.

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,839
So what's hair raising about today's topic, Neil?

10
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,080
Hair raising means scary, but also exciting.

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,760
We're talking about hair.

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,520
Which may be exciting for some, but definitely won't be scary.

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,480
Hair raising is a real thing though, isn't it?

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,480
Our hairs do rise.

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,600
Yes, Tim, they do.

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,600
We get goose bumps when we're cold, scared, or excited.

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,079
But other mammals do it better than us.

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,439
Cats fluff up when they see other cats they don't like.

19
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:50,480
That's true.

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,760
We can't fluff up because we don't have enough body hair.

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,880
I suppose we used to be as hairy as gorillas.

22
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,200
If you go back a million years or so.

23
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,920
Do you know why we lost so much hair, Tim?

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,320
Isn't it because it allowed us to sweat more easily?

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,879
This meant we didn't get so hot and tired.

26
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,040
We could run faster and for longer

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,040
and catch more animals to eat.

28
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,599
Hmm, that sounds like a good theory.

29
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,960
But do you have a theory on how many hair follicles

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,960
the human body has today?

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,640
What's a hair follicle?

32
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,960
A hair follicle is the organ that produces a hair underneath the skin.

33
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,439
Now, answer the question, Tim.

34
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,799
How many hair follicles does the human body have today?

35
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,399
Is it A, 500,000, B, 5 million, or C, 50 million?

36
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:42,239
Hmm, 50 million, sounds about right.

37
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,519
Did you know that men have more than women, Tim?

38
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,519
No, I didn't.

39
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,399
But it makes sense since men are usually hairier than women.

40
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,000
On their faces, but not necessarily on their heads.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,680
Are you referring to the fact that men of a certain age

42
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,319
can be follically challenged?

43
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,319
Hmm, if you're follically challenged,

44
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,319
it means you're losing your hair.

45
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,560
Having little or no hair is called baldness.

46
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,000
And if you've reached a certain age,

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,759
it means you aren't young anymore.

48
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,439
Why is our hair so important to us, Neil?

49
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,840
When we aren't worrying about going bald,

50
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,000
we're busy shaving, waxing,

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,360
plucking and trimming the stuff.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,599
When I say we, of course,

53
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,520
I'm referring to people in general.

54
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,680
Not myself.

55
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,199
Well, a good head of hair indicates health and youth.

56
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,360
And hair on your face, facial hair,

57
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,919
shows when boys have reached manhood.

58
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,400
On the other hand, going grey or losing your hair,

59
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,919
shows you're getting older.

60
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,000
Hair today, gone tomorrow?

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,840
Oh, bad joke, Neil.

62
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,400
Sorry.

63
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,639
It's true that hair on your head shows signs of aging.

64
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,199
But this isn't true of all human hair.

65
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,119
Let's listen to Ralph Pous, a leading hair loss researcher,

66
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:58,000
talking about this.

67
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:03,039
The eyebrows get stronger, usually in aging men.

68
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,079
The hairs in your nose and your ears get stronger.

69
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:11,359
And what a miracle of nature that an organ,

70
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:15,519
and well, the entire body is aging actually grows stronger.

71
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,280
So we may even be able to learn from hair follicles how not to age.

72
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:28,960
Hmm, I'm not sure I would swap a good head of hair for thick eyebrows and nose hair.

73
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,639
How about you, Neil?

74
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,280
I agree.

75
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,240
But let's hear more from Ralph Pous about why some hair gets stronger as you get older.

76
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,560
The hair follicle apparently knows some tricks that the other organs don't know.

77
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,639
So it's continuously regenerating itself,

78
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,159
it goes through a so-called hair cycle.

79
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,000
And part of that, we know pretty well,

80
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,719
that the stem cells that it uses to regenerate cells.

81
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,240
So a hair follicle can regenerate cells,

82
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,919
or grow new cells to replace old or damaged ones.

83
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,800
But if that's only true for eyebrows, nose, and ear hair,

84
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,560
I am not that impressed.

85
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,199
I want hairs on my head to be able to regenerate.

86
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:13,039
The important thing here is that these cells in the hair follicles

87
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,360
may help scientists discover a way to stop other organs of the body aging.

88
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:24,240
Okay, I'm now going to reveal how many hair follicles on average we have on our bodies.

89
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,120
The answer is...

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,040
5 million.

91
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,839
Oh, so not 50 million then.

92
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,839
Don't worry Tim, it was a tricky question.

93
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,399
Now let's go over the words we learned today.

94
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,600
Hair raising means scary, often in an exciting way.

95
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,720
For example, that ride on the roller coaster was a hair raising experience.

96
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,440
Next is hair follicle, the organ that produces a hair underneath the skin.

97
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,640
Scientists believe that stress can affect hair follicles.

98
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,360
A number of things can affect hair follicles, actually.

99
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,920
Age, disease, diet.

100
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,160
Okay, but we haven't got all day, Neil.

101
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,520
So let's move on to the next item, baldness,

102
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,560
which means having little or no hair on your head.

103
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,360
My grandfather is bald and he always wears a hat to cover his baldness.

104
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,720
Nice example.

105
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Is your grandpa actually bald, Neil?

106
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,960
No, he has a fine head of hair.

107
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,480
Now, if you are of a certain age, it means you are no longer young.

108
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,640
For example, all the people at the party were of a certain age.

109
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,800
How many of them had facial hair, Tim?

110
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,000
That's our next word.

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,640
And facial means to do with the face.

112
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,360
None of the people at the party had facial hair.

113
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,240
There's your answer.

114
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,200
Hmm, that's unusual, Tim.

115
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,120
Lots of men have beards these days.

116
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,800
Okay, our final word for today is regenerate,

117
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,079
which means to grow again.

118
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,280
You can talk about regenerating a range of things, for example.

119
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,360
The council has plans to regenerate this part of the city.

120
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,840
Regeneration of parts of the city is in progress.

121
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:58,160
Regeneration is the noun.

122
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,680
Well, it's time to go now, but if today's show gave you goosebumps,

123
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,759
please let us know by visiting our Twitter, Facebook and YouTube pages

124
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,959
and telling us all about it.

125
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,599
Bye-bye.

126
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:10,079
Goodbye.
