00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:12,160
Hello, this is 6-Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,600
And I'm Georgie. Whether it's Cinderella, David and Goliath or the Rocky movies, we all

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,920
love an underdog story. The underdog in a situation is the person who seems least likely

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,920
to win. Nevertheless, with some luck and plenty of hard work, the underdog sometimes

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,240
ends up the winner. Sport is full of underdog stories. Minor teams and sports people who

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,359
play with courage and end up beating the superstars and multi-million-pound clubs.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,840
But if you were given a choice between your team being the favourite to win or being the underdog,

9
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,280
it's pretty obvious you'd want to be the favourite, right?

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,359
Well, yes, being the favourite gives a team confidence. But maybe the fact that no one expects

11
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,479
the underdog to win is actually an advantage which could help them to a surprise victory.

12
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,920
In this programme, we'll be hearing about an underdog football club doing just that.

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,560
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary too.

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,560
Great, but first I have a question for you, Georgie. One of the biggest underdog stories in sports

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,840
history happened in the 2015-16 English football season, when a little-known club beat top clubs

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:33,280
like Manchester City and Liverpool overcoming odds of 5,000 to 1 to win the Premier League.

17
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,960
But which club was it? A. Charlton Athletic. B. Lester City or C. Crystal Palace.

18
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,520
I'll guess it was Crystal Palace.

19
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,600
Okay, Georgie, I'll reveal the correct answer at the end of the programme.

20
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,400
The English football Premier League is a good place to find underdogs.

21
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:59,520
Each season, the three best clubs in the second league are promoted up, while the three weakest

22
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:07,920
Premier League clubs are relegated down. One club that knows all about relegation is Lutentown FC.

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,120
In 2009, Lutentown were relegated entirely from the English League.

24
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,360
Slowly their fortunes improved, however, and they've now become the first English team to

25
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,920
progress from non-league to the Premier League. Here's Lutentown Alex talking about his team's

26
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,600
chances to BBC Radio programme mental muscle. But some of these elite Premier League clubs will look

27
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,720
down the nose at us and just think we shouldn't be there and we are there on merit and we just

28
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,800
got to prove it this season. So we are the underdog, certainly financially, but on the pitch, I don't think we will be.

29
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,440
Alex thinks some of the rich Premier League clubs look down their noses at Lutentown.

30
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,039
If you look down your nose at someone, you think you're better than them.

31
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,960
But underdogs Lutentown have done better than expected, even beating some of the big clubs

32
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:03,039
like Newcastle United. The question is how, is there something about being the underdog that

33
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:10,079
improves a team's chances of winning? To answer that, Sports Psychologist Gillian Cook spoke to BBC

34
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:16,240
Radio programme mental muscle. So you can find that when the new recruiter team comes up,

35
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,920
they've got high confidence because they've just come from a season of winnings and they've got

36
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,320
the belief that they can do it. But on the flip side, it's just as important to look at the top

37
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,280
dogs performance, who everyone expects them to win. They're playing the newly promoted teams.

38
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,760
We might think of Mad City, who might be able to come up again and start it with new time.

39
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,920
So what we can see from that is what in Psychology, Lutentown is known as choking and that's when pressure

40
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,280
gets to an individual or a team and they underperform.

41
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:51,439
Clubs newly promoted to the Premier League are used to winning and start the season confidently.

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,759
On the flip side, they have to play much stronger teams than before. The phrase on the flip side

43
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,879
is used to show the opposite, less positive side of something. Of course, it's not just the

44
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,879
underdog playing. There are also top dogs, the most successful or powerful person or team.

45
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,800
No one expects underdogs to win and this gives them freedom to relax and play naturally.

46
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,680
Top dogs, on the other hand, experience a lot of expectation and this sometimes leads to choking.

47
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,279
A sports term which describes the failure of a player to perform their best because of psychological

48
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:34,240
pressure or social expectation. Choking causes teams and players to underperform, to perform

49
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,480
worse than expected. It's also true that neutral fans, people watching a match when their team

50
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,920
isn't playing, tend to support the underdog as well. In football, it's tough at the top.

51
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,680
I think it's time to reveal the answer to your question, Neil. You asked me about the famous

52
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:59,759
Premier League winning underdogs of the 2015 to 16 football season and I guessed it was Crystal Palace.

53
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:06,640
Which was the wrong answer I'm afraid, Georgie. In fact, it was Leicester City, nickname the Foxes,

54
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:12,800
who became the unexpected champions of the Premier League. Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've

55
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,039
learned from this program about the underdog, the person in a competition or situation who seems

56
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:25,839
least likely to win. If you look down your nose at someone, you think you are superior to them.

57
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:31,759
The phrase on the flip side is used to show the opposite, less positive or less popular side of

58
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:38,240
something. The top dog is an informal way of saying the most successful or powerful person in

59
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,399
a group. In sports, choking happens when a player or team fail to perform their best because of

60
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:51,759
psychological pressure or social expectation. And finally, the verb to underperform means to perform

61
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:58,240
worse than expected. Once again, our six minutes are up. Remember to join us again next time for more
