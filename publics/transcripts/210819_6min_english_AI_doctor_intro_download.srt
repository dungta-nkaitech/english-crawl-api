8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,560
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

9
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,560
And I'm Sam.

10
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,560
Are you feeling well, Sam? No, headache or sore throat?

11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,560
No, I feel fine, thanks, Neil. Why do you ask?

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,200
Well, I've been reading some inspirational stories about the doctors and nurses fighting

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,560
COVID. When I was a boy, I always dreamed of becoming a doctor.

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,560
Ah, I see. Have you ever been in hospital?

15
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,640
Yes, I have. And I remember the nurses' bedside manner, you know, the kind and caring way

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,560
that doctors and nurses treat people who are ill.

17
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,240
Nowadays, more and more of the jobs that humans do are being carried out by machines. But

18
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:27,239
they doubt that a doctor's bedside manner could easily be replaced by a robot.

19
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:32,239
In this programme, we'll be discussing whether the revolution in artificial intelligence,

20
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:38,239
often shortened to AI, could replace human doctors and nurses. We'll be asking, can you imagine

21
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:40,239
a future without doctors?

22
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:46,239
In fact, machines are already doing some of the jobs traditionally done by doctors, scanning

23
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,239
people's bodies to detect skin cancer, for example.

24
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:55,239
Yes, that's true, Sam, and it links to my quiz question, which is about human skin.

25
00:01:55,239 --> 00:02:00,839
It's a well-known fact that skin is the human body's largest organ. But how much skin

26
00:02:00,839 --> 00:02:09,639
does the average adult have? Is it A, 2 square metres, B, 3 square metres, or C, 4 square

27
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,639
metres?

28
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,439
Of course, our skin gets loose as we age, but I can't believe there's 3 square metres

29
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:21,439
of it. I'll say the answer is A, 2 square metres.

30
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:27,240
OK, we'll find out if that's correct later. Every year in the UK, over 5 million people

31
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:32,439
are treated for skin cancer, catch it early and your chances of survival are increased.

32
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:40,439
Usually, a skin specialist or dermatologist will examine your skin using a handheld microscope.

33
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:47,439
But in 2017, a team of researchers at Stanford Medical School made an exciting announcement.

34
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:52,960
Here's Oxford University researcher Daniel Suskind telling BBC World Service Programmed

35
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,439
the Big Idea what the medics at Stanford had invented.

36
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,680
The team of researchers at Stanford last year announced the development of a system that

37
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,639
if you give it a photo of a freckle, it can tell you as accurately as 21 leading dermatologist

38
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:11,639
whether or not at freckle is cancerous.

39
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:18,839
The Stanford Medical team had invented an AI system to analyse freckles. Small brown spots

40
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:23,639
found on people's skin, especially on pale skin.

41
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,399
As it turned out, the AI program was better than doctors telling whether a freckle was

42
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:32,359
harmless or cancerous connected to some type of cancer.

43
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,360
So it seems that artificial intelligence is already replacing humans when it comes to

44
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,720
detecting cancer and doing a better job of it.

45
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,280
But Daniel Suskind isn't convinced. One reason is that AI systems still need humans to

46
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,160
program them. And as it turns out, knowing exactly how doctors detect illness remains something

47
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,400
of a mystery.

48
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,080
Here's Daniel Suskind again in conversation with BBC World Service Programmed The Big Idea.

49
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,360
If you ask a doc to how is they make a diagnosis, they might be able to point you to particularly

50
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,440
revealing parts of a reference book or give you a few rules of thumb, but ultimately they

51
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,400
struggle. They'd say again, it requires things like creativity and judgment and things are

52
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,759
very difficult to articulate. And so traditionally it's been thought very hard to automate.

53
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:27,759
If a human being can't explain how they do these special things, where on earth do we begin

54
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,639
in writing instructions for a machine to follow?

55
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,879
Most doctors find it difficult to explain how they make a diagnosis. Their judgment about

56
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,639
what someone's particular sickness is made by examining them.

57
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:48,800
Diagnosing someone's illness is complicated, but there are some rules of thumb. A rule of thumb

58
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,480
is a practical but approximate way of doing something.

59
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,480
For example, when cooking, a good rule of thumb is two portions of water to one portion

60
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,480
of rice. Exactly. And because identifying sickness is so difficult, Daniel says, where on

61
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,960
earth do we begin writing instructions for a machine? We use phrases like where, how,

62
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,160
or what on earth to show feelings like anger, surprise or disbelief.

63
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,840
I might show surprise by asking Sam, how on earth did you know the answer to that?

64
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,920
Aha, I guess you're talking about your quiz question, Neil. And you didn't be so

65
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,720
surprised. I'm naturally brainy.

66
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,720
Of course you are. In my quiz question, I asked Sam how much skin there is on an adult

67
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,080
human body. And I said it was a two square metres.

68
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,080
Which was the correct answer. With your brains, I think you'd make a good doctor, Sam,

69
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,480
and I'm sure you'd have a good bedside manner too.

70
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,720
Ah, you mean the kind and caring way that doctors and nurses treat their patients.

71
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,680
Okay, let's recap the rest of the vocabulary starting with freckle, a small brown spot

72
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,440
on someone's skin. Freckles are usually harmless, but some skin spots can be cancerous, connected

73
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,480
to cancer. The doctor's diagnosis is a judgment about what someone's particular sickness or

74
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:19,280
disease is. A rule of thumb is a useful but approximate way of doing or measuring something.

75
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:25,199
And finally, we use phrases like where on earth as a way to show emotions like anger,

76
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,399
surprise or disbelief.

77
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:31,559
That's all for this programme, but join us for the next edition of 6 Minute English, when

78
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:35,919
we'll discuss another trending topic and the related vocabulary.

79
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,119
Why on earth would you miss it? Good bye for now.

80
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:40,119
Goodbye.
