00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,359
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,399
And I'm Dan.

7
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:19,359
Now then, Dan, what do you think of dating apps?

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,199
You know, apps on your phone that help you find a romantic partner.

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,920
I can't say I've ever used them myself.

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,280
How about you?

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,760
Neither have I, but I've got friends who have

12
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:30,640
very successfully.

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,560
Lots of weddings.

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,200
Oh great.

15
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,280
Now research shows that fewer than 5% of people who have used dating apps

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,880
actually go out on a date with someone they've met through them.

17
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,040
We'll find out the reasons for this shortly, but first a question.

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,960
Even though dating apps are not used as much as we might think,

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,040
they are still big business.

20
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,640
But do you know how big?

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,160
Around the world last year, how much was spent on them?

22
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,039
Was it A, less than half a billion dollars?

23
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,879
B, between half a billion and a billion dollars, or C, over a billion dollars?

24
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,319
Any ideas, Dan?

25
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:14,400
Well, this is purely a guess, but let's say over a billion dollars.

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,719
Well, we'll have the answer at the end of the programme.

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,239
Elizabeth Tiniman's is a researcher who studied the use of a particular dating app.

28
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,640
She spoke on the BBC's You and Yours Radio programme on Radio 4.

29
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,040
Her study confirmed that comparatively few people who used the app

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,200
used it to arrange to meet up with someone.

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,719
She talked about the people's motives for using the app.

32
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,599
Motives is a word which means reasons.

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,079
So what were those motives?

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,719
We found from all the people that we surveyed that only slightly more than half of them

35
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,640
actually met up with someone.

36
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,680
So it doesn't look like a lot of people are using it to meet up,

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,720
but it makes sense because we also looked at why they were using a dating app.

38
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:06,960
And the most popular and most common motives were using it out of curiosity

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,520
and using it to pass time or entertainment.

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,800
So they're not actively using these dating apps to meet people.

41
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,840
Like swiping with friends is something that happens fairly often, especially among millennials.

42
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,240
Tiniman said that people used the app to pass the time and simply for entertainment.

43
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,960
What other motives did she mention, Dad?

44
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,800
Well, she said that people used it out of curiosity.

45
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,039
If you do something out of curiosity, you're just interested in seeing what it is and what it does.

46
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,599
Maybe you've heard about something and although you don't want to actually try it,

47
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,640
you do want to see what it's all about.

48
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:53,199
For example, when I was traveling once out of curiosity,

49
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,759
I went to see people bungee jumping, but it was never something I was going to do myself.

50
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,599
What's the lack of actual dating through the dating app?

51
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,799
A surprise?

52
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:07,759
No, she said that because they looked at the motives, the result makes sense.

53
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,519
When something makes sense, it's understandable.

54
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,719
It's not surprising.

55
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,560
There is another view as to why people are not using dating apps for actual dating.

56
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,719
This is Zoe Strympel, who is a dating historian.

57
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,000
She argues that because there is so much choice and so many opportunities to find a partner

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,960
through an app, it can make the dating process unpleasant and people get tired of it.

59
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,000
People are being horribly disillusioned.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,800
I think people have also started to feel jaded.

61
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,400
People are feeling that they're aware that these relationships are often very callous,

62
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,200
and that's to do with the sort of incredible sense of choice.

63
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,760
She says that people feel disillusioned and jaded.

64
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,360
What does she mean?

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,400
When you're disillusioned, it means you are happy with and disappointed by something,

66
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,879
because it isn't as good as it used to be, or it's not as good as you thought it was going to be.

67
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,599
If you have many experiences like that, you become jaded, which means you become bored and lose

68
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,879
interest in something. She also commented that the dating experience can be callous.

69
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,040
This means that emotionally, it can be very tough, and you have to be ready to accept rejection,

70
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,360
or to reject people yourself.

71
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,879
And this is not always done in the kindest way.

72
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,719
Here's Zoe Strympel again.

73
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,680
People are being horribly disillusioned.

74
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,399
I think people have also started to feel jaded.

75
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:36,000
People are feeling that they're aware that these relationships are often very callous,

76
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,800
and that's to do with the sort of incredible sense of choice.

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,319
Okay, time to review today's vocabulary.

78
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,600
But first, let's have the answer to that quiz question.

79
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,639
I asked how much was spent on dating apps last year?

80
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,680
Was it A less than half a billion dollars?

81
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,639
B between half a billion and a billion dollars?

82
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,560
Or C over a billion dollars?

83
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,519
Dan, you said?

84
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,240
I said C over a billion dollars.

85
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,079
Well, the total was just under 600 million dollars,

86
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,639
so the correct answer was B between half a billion and a billion dollars.

87
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,159
Good guess if you got that one right.

88
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,759
Right, now it's time to recap today's vocabulary.

89
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,240
Our first word was motives.

90
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,879
A motive is your reason for doing something.

91
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,519
If something makes sense, it's not a surprise, and you can understand it.

92
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,240
The next phrase was out of curiosity.

93
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,879
This is when you do something for no particular reason,

94
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,919
other than you are interested in seeing it or trying it.

95
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,759
Then we had disillusioned.

96
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,680
This is a feeling you get when something isn't as good as it used to be

97
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,920
or as good as you expected it to be, and you become disappointed by it.

98
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,639
And that can lead to your being jaded,

99
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,920
which is a feeling of dissatisfaction and boredom with something

100
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,759
that's been going on for a while.

101
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,599
And finally, there was callus, an adjective which means

102
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:55,759
uncaring and cold-hearted.

103
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,480
Well, I hope you aren't disillusioned with six-minute English,

104
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,240
and we'll join us again next time.

105
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,680
In the meantime, find BBCLearningEnglish.com online

106
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,720
and on social media and on our own app.

107
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,280
And before you ask, it's not a dating app.

108
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,720
Bye for now. Bye-bye.
