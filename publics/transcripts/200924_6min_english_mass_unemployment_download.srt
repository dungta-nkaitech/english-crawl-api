00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,039
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,240
And I'm Sam.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,199
You and I are lucky, Sam, because we can do our jobs remotely, working from home.

8
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,080
There are some downsides, though, like not being out to meet up with friends or share ideas with

9
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:30,559
and colleagues. I'm going out for lunch.

10
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,960
But the coronavirus pandemic has caused millions of people to lose their job

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,599
and force thousands more out of work temporarily.

12
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:40,960
With no idea if their job will still be there when they return.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,599
For those daily workers without savings to pay the rent and feed their families,

14
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:47,599
it's been especially stressful.

15
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,519
Each job loss is a potential personal tragedy.

16
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:55,359
In this programme, we'll be assessing the post-COVID job landscape

17
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,799
and asking whether a radical new approach is needed to prevent global mass unemployment.

18
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:06,480
We'll be asking whether one of the world's smallest and richest countries, Denmark,

19
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,840
might hold the answer.

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,879
And of course, we'll be learning some new vocabulary as well.

21
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:13,280
But first, it's time for our quiz question.

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,519
One man who knows a lot about jobs is Brad Smith, president of Microsoft,

23
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,439
a company employing over 150,000 workers.

24
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,519
He's made gloomy predictions about the number of people out of work.

25
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:31,759
But how many people does he predict will be left unemployed this year as a result of the coronavirus

26
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:40,400
pandemic? Is it a one quarter of a billion people, b one third of a billion people, or c half a

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,680
billion people? Well, those numbers do really look gloomy. I'll say b one third of a billion people

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,160
unemployed around the world. Okay, Sam, we'll come back to that later.

29
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,680
Now, mass unemployment, millions of people losing their jobs due to the COVID pandemic,

30
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,120
has left the world facing an enormous jobs challenge.

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,560
Elizabeth Reynolds of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is author of the report

32
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,040
Work of the Future. Here she is talking to the BBC World Service programme

33
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,600
Business Daily about the current situation.

34
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:20,079
Well, I think in the short term, it does feel like we are not yet in a place where we can

35
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:25,439
talk about recovery and rebuilding completely. We're still going to see the ramifications or the

36
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:32,400
impact and the ripple effect of all of this for months to come. We use the expressions in the long

37
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:40,079
term and in the short term to talk about what will happen over a long or short period of time.

38
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,640
In the short term, over a short period of time, Elizabeth thinks it's too early to talk about

39
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,960
a job's recovery. She also warns that we haven't yet experienced the full impact or ramifications

40
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:59,040
of the pandemic. Like throwing a stone into water, these consequences create a ripple effect.

41
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,439
A situation where one event causes a series of effects which spread and produce further effects.

42
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,199
According to Elizabeth, the problem is that many of the government measures

43
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:17,439
put in place to support jobs are not sustainable in the long term. She says more radical change is needed.

44
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:23,280
Of course, the big question is how. One proposed solution is the Danish model. This balances

45
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,639
citizens' rights and duties. Denmark provides one of the world's most generous unemployment

46
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:34,960
payouts, but in return, citizens are expected to commit to any job or training the government

47
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,719
thinks would be beneficial. Jacob Kierkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington,

48
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:46,000
is himself a dain. Here he explains to BBC Business Daily how the model works.

49
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,040
It's very easy to hire and fire people in Denmark. It doesn't cost you anything and you don't

50
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,040
have sort of a guaranteed job for life once you get a permanent contract which is the situation in

51
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:06,959
many other continental European countries. So it combines labour market flexibility with employment

52
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,519
security, namely the idea that people if they lose their job, they know that they can find another

53
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,920
job even if that requires them to pick up new skills because that upskilling or re-skilling,

54
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,680
if you like, is going to be made available to them partly through very lavish government subsidies.

55
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,560
Denmark enjoys labour flexibility because it's easy for bosses to hire and fire,

56
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:39,199
employ someone and release them from employment, meaning there's no such thing as a job for life,

57
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,920
one that you can stay in or your working life. But citizens also have the security of lavish,

58
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,680
generous and expensive benefits, and the government will also pay for worker upskilling,

59
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,519
training to learn new skills, making them better at their jobs.

60
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:01,519
And thereby preventing unemployment, which reminds me of your quiz question, Neil.

61
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,079
Yes, I asked you how many people were predicted to lose their jobs to the Covid pandemic.

62
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,160
And I said B, one third of a billion.

63
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,040
Well, fortunately it's the slightly lower but still worrying figure of one quarter of a billion

64
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:22,080
We've been discussing predictions of mass unemployment in the short term, or over a short time

65
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:29,200
period, caused by the coronavirus pandemic. It also seems we will be experiencing the ripple effects,

66
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,920
series of consequences of the virus for a long time to come.

67
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,800
One solution to mass unemployment may be the Danish model, with a power to hire or fire

68
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,759
employee someone or make them unemployed, means there are not many jobs for life.

69
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,759
Jobs you can do all your working life.

70
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:55,439
But lavish, expensive and generous, benefits from the government, who also pay for upskilling

71
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:01,840
or training in new skills, means that Danish unemployment is rarely out of control.

72
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,879
That's all we have time for, but come back soon for more trending topics and useful vocabulary

73
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,560
here at 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. Goodbye for now.

74
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,199
Bye.
