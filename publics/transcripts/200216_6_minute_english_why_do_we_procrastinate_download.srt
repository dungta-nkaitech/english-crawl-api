00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish, I'm Sam

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And I'm Neil

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Come on Neil, let's make a start

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I've got a deadline to meet today and I haven't finished my work yet

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let me guess, it's because you delayed and delayed

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And put your work off until the last minute as usual

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You're a real procrastinator, Sam, someone who keeps delaying things that need to be done

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What can I say? I work better when a deadline is approaching

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I see, but did you know that people who procrastinate have higher levels of stress and lower well-being?

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Procrastination is also linked with lower financial and career success

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So there's a lot of reasons not to do it

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
In this programme we're discussing procrastination

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The act of delaying things that must be done until later

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Often because they're difficult, boring or unpleasant

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And as usual we'll be learning some new vocabulary along the way

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So without wasting any more time I have a question for you, Sam

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The fact that procrastinating or putting things off is bad for us

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Doesn't stop people doing it

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
According to recent research by DePaul University in Chicago

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What percentage of people procrastinate so much that it interferes with their day-to-day life?

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Is it a 10% b 20% or c 30%

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'll guess that around 10% of people have a serious procrastination problem

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay, Sam, we'll find out the answer later in the programme

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Sam is certainly not alone in putting things off until the last minute

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Here's Ella Al-Shamahi, presenter of BBC Radio 4's Why Do We Do That?

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Talking to comedian Ishaan Akbar about his procrastination habit

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Would you say Ishaan that you're a procrastinator?

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I am a serial procrastinator without a shadow of a doubt

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why? Why do you think you procrastinate?

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Over the years I've told myself that I procrastinate because I work better under pressure

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That's what I've told myself

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Ishaan thinks that he is a procrastinator without a shadow of a doubt

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
A phrase which is used to emphasise that you are completely certain of something

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Ishaan also says that like Sam, he works better under pressure

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
when he feels stressed or anxious because of having too much to do

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
But maybe also like Sam, Ishaan has a problem organising his workload and managing his time

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Hang on Neil, my time management skills are okay

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Thank you, with me it's more of an emotional response

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I see a mountain of work feel threatened and think how on earth will I finish all that?

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What Sam says is supported by a theory of human evolution

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
which explains how putting things off is an emotional response

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Back when we were living in caves life was dangerous and short

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and our ancestors were impulsive

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
They acted suddenly on instinct without thinking about the consequences of what they were doing

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Back then being impulsive was a good thing

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But in modern life with work goals and deadlines

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
when we are impulsive and get distracted we procrastinate

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So rather than being a problem with time management

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Sam should blame her caveman ancestors who acted on impulse

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's listen again to comedian Ishaan Akbar talking about how he feels when he procrastinates

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
A lot of stuff you read about procrastination focuses on the time management element of it

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I've probably got a better sense that for me it seems very squarely around the emotional aspect of it

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Perhaps I get more emotional gratification from doing it last minute

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I need to understand why I prefer that over the calm serenity of getting things done with oodles of time in my hands

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
In the same way that our ancestors felt good living on impulse

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Ishaan thinks he gets gratification of feeling of pleasure and satisfaction from doing things at the last minute

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What he doesn't understand is why he prefers to work under pressure

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Instead of finishing calmly with oodles or lots of time

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Unlike Ishaan I'd rather finish my work feeling relaxed but there never seems to be enough time

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well breaking down the task into smaller stages also breaks down the level of threat you feel from your workload

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Also forgiving yourself for procrastinating in the past seems helpful in avoiding procrastinating in the future

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So forgive yourself and start making changes Sam before you end up like the time-wasters in my question

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What percentage of people procrastinate so much that it interferes with day-to-day life?

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Well I guessed it was 10%

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Which was the wrong answer I'm afraid in fact around 20% of us have a procrastination habit

67
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So strong it makes life difficult

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this program on procrastination

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Delaying or putting off doing things until later, often because they're difficult, unpleasant or boring

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The phrase without a shadow of a doubt is used to emphasise that you are completely certain of something

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If you're under pressure you feel stressed or anxious because of having too much to do

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Impulsive behaviour is sudden and spontaneous, done without thinking about the consequences

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Gradification means a feeling of pleasure and satisfaction

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And finally when you have oodles of something you have a very large amount of something pleasant

75
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Like time which once again we've run out of

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm rushing off to finish my work Neil but remember to make time to join us again soon here at 6 Minute English

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Bye for now

78
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Goodbye

79
