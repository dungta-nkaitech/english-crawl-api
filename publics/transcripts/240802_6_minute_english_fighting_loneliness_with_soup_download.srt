2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What's our Beth? You look a little sad.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, recently I've been spending lots of time with my cat and houseplants,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
if you know what I mean. I'm feeling a bit lonely.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It might help to know that you're not the only one feeling lonely.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Loneliness has been called the modern epidemic,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
although millions of us live together in towns and cities,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
more and more people report feeling lonely and unconnected to those they live close to.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Loneliness can affect anyone,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and while everyone's experience of loneliness is different,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
its effects can be serious.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Researchers shown that loneliness puts people at greater risk of many health issues,

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
including dementia and heart disease.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So how can loneliness be fixed?

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
In this programme, we'll be hearing about one project in the Netherlands aiming to do just that.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But first, I have a question for you, Beth.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Here in the UK, an organisation called the campaign to end loneliness,

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
has been offering advice and support since 2011.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So, according to the campaign,

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
what proportion of British adults report feeling lonely at least some of the time?

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Is it A, 29% B, 39% or C, 49%?

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I will guess it's 39%.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Okay, Beth, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Feeling lonely is not necessarily the same as being alone.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Some people can happily spend lots of time on their own,

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
while others may be surrounded by people, but still feel disconnected.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So what do we mean when we say we feel lonely?

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Here's Myra and Ibi, presenter of BBC World Service programme People Fixing the World,

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
explaining what loneliness means to her.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's that feeling when you crave people's company and you find it hard to connect,

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
or maybe you just feel left out with no one to turn to.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Now, feeling lonely isn't just uncomfortable.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
When it's experienced over time, it's been associated with health issues like

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
a higher risk of having depression, dementia or even heart disease.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
When we're lonely, we crave people's company.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We want their company a lot.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We might also feel left out and happy because we're not included in what others are doing,

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and maybe we have no one to turn to.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
No one we can go to and ask for support and help.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Someone who suffered all these feelings was Beth De Bruin.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
In 2013, Beth, aged 74, was found dead at her home in Rotterdam in the Netherlands.

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Her death wasn't suspicious, but it shocked the whole country,

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
because it turned out she'd been dead for 10 years.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Beth had lost contact with her only child and kept to herself in her apartment.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So when she died sometime in 2003, no one realised.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Beth's tragic story inspired a national campaign to combat loneliness,

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
including one project called Oma's Soup,

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
a kitchen bringing lonely elderly people together with school children and students to make soup.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oma means grandma in Dutch,

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and the project encourages young people to spend time with their grandparents generation.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Here, Claire Bates, reporter for BBC World Service Program,

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
people fixing the world explains how the project got started.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Well, it's run by two young guys called Max Kronendike and Martin Cantas,

57
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and now they were concerned their grandparents' generation were becoming isolated and lonely.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And meanwhile, they had lots of student friends who had free time,

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
so they thought, why not try to bring these two generations together through making soup?

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Oma's Soup was started by Max and Martin, two local guys or men.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
They wanted to involve their student friends because they had lots of free time,

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
time when they do not have to work or study and can do what they want.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Max and Martin found the perfect way to help elderly people who felt lonely

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
by bringing them together with students.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
If you bring someone together, you help people or groups to become friendly

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
or to do something together, especially something they wouldn't usually do, like make soup.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Oma's Soup has been a big success and has spread to other cities across the Netherlands,

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
including Rotterdam, the hometown of Bebdebroon,

69
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
making her tragic death the spark for something much more hopeful.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I think it's time to reveal the answer to your question, Neil.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Right, I asked you what proportion of British adults report feeling lonely at least some of the time.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And I said it was 39%.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Which was the wrong answer I'm afraid, Beth, sadly, the correct answer is even higher.

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
49% of adults that's around 26 million people in the UK,

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
making it even more important to reach out and connect with others.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Okay, it's time to recap the vocabulary we've learned in this programme,

77
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
starting with the verb Crave to have a strong wish or desire for something.

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
If you feel left out, you're unhappy because you've been excluded from something.

79
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
To turn to someone means to go to someone and ask them for help or support.

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
A guy is an informal way of saying a man.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Free time, also called leisure time, is time when you do not have to work or study and can do what you want.

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And finally, the phrasal verb to bring someone together means to help people or groups become friendly or do something together,

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
especially if they usually don't.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Once again, our six minutes are up.

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But if you're feeling lonely, remember you're not alone.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So reach out by joining us again next time here at six minutes English.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Goodbye for now.

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Bye.
