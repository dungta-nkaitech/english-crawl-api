00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:14,880
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Catherine.

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,960
And I'm Neil. Do you know, Catherine?

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,000
Someone actually talked to me on the underground this morning.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,719
No, really? Yeah. Wow.

8
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,480
I should perhaps point out that talking to someone you don't know on the tube

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,879
is quite unusual behaviour in London.

10
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,079
So Neil, what did they say? Well, they said what a lovely day it was.

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,839
Great to see the sun shining in London. Something along those lines.

12
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:40,239
But it was actually nice to chat instead of sitting there with a frown on my face,

13
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,600
fiddling with my phone. Which is what you probably always do to

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,239
pass the time on public transport, Neil? Yes, it is. Me and thousands of others.

15
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,120
But it got me thinking. If it makes me feel better to talk to people on the way to work,

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,039
why don't I and other commuters in the city do it more often?

17
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,640
Well, that's a good question, Neil. And maybe we'll find some answers in the show.

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,519
Because today we're talking about why cities make us so rude.

19
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,000
And I have a question for you. When we have a positive interaction with somebody,

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,719
our body releases a chemical. But what's the name of this chemical?

21
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:21,359
Is it A, melatonin, B, oxytocin or C, thyroxin?

22
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,439
Hmm, I don't know. But I'm going to say A, melatonin.

23
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,480
Well, with a see if you're right or not later on in the show.

24
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,799
But did you know, Neil, that an organisation called Talk to Me London

25
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:39,759
has created these tube chat badges that you can wear to show that you're happy to talk to a stranger?

26
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,479
Maybe you should get one. Yeah, maybe I should.

27
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,200
But the thing is, people in big cities are often scared to start a conversation with a stranger,

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,280
because well, you don't know what might happen. That's true.

29
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:58,719
Now, let's listen to Dr. L Boog, a social psychologist at Birmingham City University here in the UK.

30
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,640
She agrees that people can view cities as threatening places.

31
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:11,199
When we step off the metro or onto a crowded city street, our brain becomes hyper vigilant to

32
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:16,800
the perception of threats around us. We're just one small person in a very large set of other

33
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,719
people and a large body of people. This then leads to behaviours that are

34
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:30,320
insular and defensive. We're persistently looking for potential threats around us,

35
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,120
and this then makes us not give eye contact. This will reduce the likelihood that

36
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,680
anybody will say hello. It's a protective mechanism by which we can survive our journey

37
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,840
to once we're going, which makes us all seem really, really rude to one another.

38
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:56,800
Dr. L Boog there, and hyper vigilant means being extremely watchful of what's going on around you.

39
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,400
People can behave unpredictably, and like Dr. Boog says, you're just one person in a crowd

40
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,560
of others and you just don't know who might be dangerous. Yeah, I see what you mean.

41
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,520
And the fact we are constantly on the lookout for potential threats, well, it affects our behaviour.

42
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,840
That's right. And as a protective mechanism, we avoid speaking to or making eye contact with

43
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,240
other people. So we become insular, which means inward looking. That sounds awful. But actually,

44
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,439
I know people who move to London in order to be anonymous, to blend in with the crowd and not

45
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,719
have to talk to people. Well, if you grow up in a small town, it can feel claustrophobic,

46
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:40,240
which means not having enough space to feel comfortable. You know, you can't do anything without

47
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,159
the whole community knowing about it. You might have nosy neighbours.

48
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,080
Hmm, and a nosy person shows too much interest in other people's business.

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,600
Now, it's good to point out that people living in cities have stuff to do,

50
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,439
and it's not necessarily rudeness that stops people from chatting. It's about efficiency.

51
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,960
Getting to work on time, getting things done. Let's hear from Thomas Farley, writer and

52
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,640
broadcaster, and expert on manners for more on this.

53
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,840
The cost of living in cities is higher. The success quotient is higher. It's a place where you

54
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,120
hustle to survive. And if you are not hustling, and I mean that literally and figuratively,

55
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,600
you are not able to survive and thrive. So we often don't have much time for chit chat.

56
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,439
I think we just all need to be mindful that it's not a deliberate disregard or somebody trying

57
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,240
to be rude on purpose. It's simply that people are, they have a destination to be.

58
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,279
So what does Thomas Farley mean by success quotient, Catherine?

59
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:49,519
Success quotient means your ability to be successful in work relative to the average person.

60
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:54,800
And Thomas Farley is saying that in cities, people have higher success quotients.

61
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,639
Cities are also competitive places, so people have to hustle to survive. Do we hustle, Catherine?

62
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,680
No, I don't think we hustle, Neil. Hustle means to work aggressively to make money.

63
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,079
We do have plenty of time for chit chat though. And chit chat, by the way, means

64
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,319
unimportant conversation. That's what we do.

65
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,000
What we do isn't chit chat, Neil. It's highly informative and instructional.

66
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,919
Now, I think it must be time to hear the answer to today's quiz. Do you remember? I asked

67
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,319
when we have a positive interaction with someone, our body releases a chemical.

68
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:36,639
What's the name of this chemical? Is it A, melatonin, B, oxytocin, or C, thyroxin?

69
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,319
And it's A melatonin, I'm absolutely sure. Sorry, the correct answer is oxytocin,

70
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:49,519
a hormone commonly known as the love drug. It reduces fear, increases trust between people,

71
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,639
and evokes feelings of contentment.

72
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:59,039
Now, here are the words we learned today. Hypervigilance, insular, claustrophobic,

73
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,639
nosy, quotient, hustle, chit chat. That's the end of today's six-minute English.

74
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,360
Don't forget to join us again soon. Goodbye.
