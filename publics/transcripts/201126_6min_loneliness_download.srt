00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,359
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,640
And I'm Rob.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,280
It's great that you're here to keep me company, to spend time with me so I don't get lonely,

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,400
because loneliness is the subject of this programme.

8
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,759
It's good to be here, Neil. I think many of us have experienced loneliness at some point.

9
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,399
Maybe you felt lonely because all your friends have gone out for dinner without you,

10
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,320
or maybe you felt lonely just because you don't fit in somewhere.

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,200
Yes, that's when we sometimes use the expression to feel lonely in a crowd.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,560
Well, we'll be exploring if this is a new idea or something.

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,840
Humans have always experienced, and along the way we'll be teaching you some new vocabulary.

14
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,080
But now I'm here to keep you company. How about a question for me?

15
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,640
Of course. Well, one possibly lonely man is Mauro Morandi.

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,480
He's lived alone on Boudelli Island in Italy for many years, but how many years exactly?

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,640
Is it A, six years?

18
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,000
B, 31 years, or C, 44 years?

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,080
Hmm, 44 years will be tough, as with 31.

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,920
So I'll go for six years.

21
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,560
Okay, Rob, we'll find out later if that's right.

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,519
Now, I'm sure we all want to be alone from time to time to escape the demands of our colleagues

23
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:32,079
or the pressures of real life, but would we really want to be totally alone?

24
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,600
Well, I certainly wouldn't.

25
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,240
And research has found that prolonged social isolation is bad for us, particularly mentally.

26
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:46,159
It's an interesting topic, and one that the BBC Radio 4 program thinking allowed has been exploring.

27
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,719
It's guest, Faye Bound Alberti, reader in history at the University of York,

28
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,879
explained how loneliness is a relatively new emotional state.

29
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,159
A state is a condition at a particular time.

30
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:03,359
Let's hear what she had to say about references to loneliness in literature.

31
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:06,960
Well, novels are fascinating because there's a difference between novels in the 18th century

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,400
when the first came into being, and novels in the 19th century, in the 18th century,

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,240
something like Robinson Crusoe, there's not a single reference to loneliness.

34
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,360
By the 19th century, novels are full of lonely people,

35
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,599
and that reflects those kinds of social changes.

36
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,879
Give me some examples. What may I can't just an example?

37
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,079
Well, I suppose I'm thinking about if you compare something like

38
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:30,639
weathering heights where you have this desi on the part of the heroin to find love,

39
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,479
which is bundled up too in this sense of the self has not been complete

40
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,959
without another, or test of the Derbevelles.

41
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,240
And so Victorian fiction in particular tends to be full of women

42
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,479
who are in search of the significant other,

43
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,280
and needing to find happiness and an absence of loneliness in the domestic.

44
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,879
It's interesting that Faye mentions the story of Robinson Crusoe

45
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,039
about a man living on a desert island does not mention the word loneliness.

46
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,639
But because of a shift in how people behaved and thought in the 19th century,

47
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,920
called social change, loneliness became an emotion that was written about in stories.

48
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,159
Ah, but loneliness tended to be something affecting women.

49
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,639
They were searching for happiness by finding a significant other, a partner,

50
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,319
usually a man who they wanted to marry, how things have changed.

51
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:25,119
Yes, now Faye also went on to talk about how some female authors, like Virginia Woolf,

52
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:29,919
looked for solitude that's being alone, because that helped them be creative.

53
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:36,479
Even today being alone gives us headspace and time to think, as long as it doesn't last forever.

54
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,159
Anyway, as we mentioned, we've probably all been lonely at some point,

55
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,359
and Faye Boundau Bertie told the thinking allowed program

56
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,440
that loneliness can take many forms.

57
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,280
Absolutely, I think that loneliness is something that affects all people,

58
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,960
but at different times in their lives.

59
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,040
And I describe it in terms of pinch points.

60
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,120
There are times when we change, we become, we get marriage, we become mothers,

61
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,320
we get divorced.

62
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,720
Anything that changes our life might put us under temporary loneliness.

63
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,120
When it's a problem, is it when it becomes chronic?

64
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,680
It seems that there are certain times in our lives when we might feel lonely,

65
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,680
when we break up with a partner or have a baby and feel isolated, for example.

66
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,680
These are moments that Faye describes as pinch points, times in your life when there are difficulties

67
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,519
and things slow down or change.

68
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,439
We could say loneliness at these times is understandable, normal and temporary.

69
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:35,280
When it becomes a bigger issue, it's what Faye describes as chronic, so long lasting.

70
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,800
And loneliness isn't always obvious to other people,

71
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,840
so it's good to check in with friends and family to see how they're feeling and to ask if they're okay.

72
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,759
Of course, it would be difficult to check in on Mauro Morandi,

73
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,879
who he's been living on Boudelli Island in Italy for many years, but how many years exactly?

74
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,400
Well, I thought six years. Was I right?

75
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,480
I'm afraid not, it's actually been 31 years.

76
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,480
He told National Geographic magazine, I'm sort of in prison here,

77
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,480
but it's a prison that I chose for myself.

78
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,520
So I'm guessing he's got used to his own company.

79
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,680
I certainly couldn't live alone for that long.

80
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,920
I'd be too lonely. I need company, Rob.

81
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,840
Yeah, me too, Neil.

82
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,120
And loneliness is what we've been discussing in this program.

83
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,080
Here's a recap of some of the vocabulary we've mentioned.

84
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:28,000
Firstly, to keep someone company is to spend time with someone so they don't get lonely.

85
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,680
Social change is a shift in how people behave and think.

86
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,639
A significant other is an informal way of describing a partner.

87
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,840
Solitude describes being alone.

88
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,160
When talking about life, pinch points are times where there are difficulties and things slow

89
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,040
down or change. And chronic describes a health condition that is long-lasting.

90
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,160
And that's all we have time for in this program.

91
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,519
But remember, you can find more useful vocabulary,
