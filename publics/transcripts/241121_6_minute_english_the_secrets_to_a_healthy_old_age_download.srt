2
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:12,400
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Phil.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,640
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,920
Grey hairs, wrinkles and poor eyesight,

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,719
are common signs that our body is growing old.

6
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:23,960
Much as we'd like to, we can't avoid aging,

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,519
so it's important to stay healthy as we get older.

8
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,879
In this programme, we'll be hearing about some new research,

9
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,439
offering fresh advice on how to stay young at heart,

10
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,119
an idiom meaning to keep a youthful outlook on life, whatever your age.

11
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,960
And of course, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,519
But 6 Minute English isn't just about vocabulary.

13
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:48,640
We improve your listening skills as well,

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,760
so why not turn on the audio subtitles

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,239
or download the script to read along as you listen?

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,880
Could also help you answer my question.

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,920
The oldest recorded person ever to have lived

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:08,439
was a woman who was born in 1875 and lived to the ripe old age of 122.

19
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,120
But which country was she from?

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:16,280
Was it a, Japan, B, France or C, Italy?

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,079
Oh, I am going to say Japan.

22
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,879
Okay, Beth, I'll reveal the correct answer later in the programme.

23
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,039
Aging is partly caused by the body cells starting to decay,

24
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:31,319
so you might think we're powerless to stop it.

25
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:35,399
But listen to this good news from Professor Sarah Harper,

26
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:39,199
Director of the Oxford Institute of Population Aging.

27
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:42,359
I think the really exciting thing is that even 10 years ago,

28
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:45,159
we would have thought, yes, it's all to do with ourselves.

29
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:48,919
Now we understand this relationship between what we call cell and society,

30
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:50,919
and we really can make a difference.

31
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:53,159
And in fact, a recent paper just came out

32
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,560
which said that 60% of our aging can be controlled by how we live.

33
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,359
Professor Harper says that 60% of aging is determined by something

34
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:05,399
we can influence our lifestyle.

35
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,199
So what lifestyle should we choose?

36
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:14,199
Here's Sarah Harper giving more details to BBC Radio 4 programme inside health.

37
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:17,000
You know, there's obviously things like diet, which I think will come to,

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,319
but there's also a positive attitude.

39
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,719
And there's been some wonderful twin studies that have been done,

40
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:25,960
where you've had twins and they have been able to map them across their lives.

41
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,919
And if you're positive, you actually have far greater health in later life

42
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,199
than if you're negative.

43
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:36,120
One important factor in aging well is a positive attitude,

44
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,280
feeling hopeful, confident, and focused on the good things in life.

45
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:44,759
This conclusion was based on several twin studies.

46
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:51,079
Scientific research which uses twins to study the roles of genetics and environment in human development.

47
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,759
In studies, Professor Harper found positive twins

48
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,800
stayed healthier than negative twins as they aged.

49
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,199
Loneliness can be another problem as we get older.

50
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:08,199
Here, Professor Sarah Harper explains how in countries like Spain, Italy and Greece,

51
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:11,560
regular social interaction helps people age well.

52
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,240
Loneliness can have the same impact as smoking in the statistics.

53
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,680
And when we talk about the Mediterranean diet,

54
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,439
it's also got two other sides.

55
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:26,040
It's got exercise because these people tend to be outside more,

56
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,280
because they have that kind of a climate.

57
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,360
But also, they still tend to live...

58
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,319
Communal meals.

59
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,760
Absolutely. They have communal meals.

60
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,800
They tend to live together more in multi-generational households

61
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,400
that is changing a bit.

62
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,040
So there's a whole lifestyle around it.

63
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,400
The healthy food, such as fresh vegetables and fish,

64
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,040
eaten by people living in countries around the Mediterranean sea,

65
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,040
is known as the Mediterranean diet.

66
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,120
Mediterranean cultures have other advantages too,

67
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,040
including outdoor exercise, which is easier in warm climates,

68
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,680
and communal meals, occasions where people sit down and share food together.

69
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,840
Mediterranean people are also more likely to live in multi-generational households,

70
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,680
where people from two or more generations of a family live together in the same house.

71
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,439
Not everyone can live in the Mediterranean,

72
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:25,800
but it seems a positive attitude and social interaction are two things we can all do to age well.

73
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,800
Speaking of which, what was the answer to your question, Phil?

74
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,519
Okay, well I asked you about the oldest living person ever recorded.

75
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:38,680
I asked what country they came from, and you said Japan.

76
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,839
Well, I can reveal the answer is actually France.

77
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:48,919
A lady in France lived for 122 years and 164 days.

78
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:53,399
And if you knew the answer to that, there are other questions about this programme

79
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,079
in the quiz on our worksheet, which you can find on our website,

00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,559
BBCLearningEnglish.com.

81
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:04,359
Okay, let's recap the new vocabulary we've learnt about staying young at heart,

82
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:10,120
an idiom which means to think and behave in a youthful way, in spite of growing older.

83
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:17,160
People with a positive attitude feel hopeful, confident and focused on the good things in life.

84
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,840
Twin studies use twins to investigate the roles of genetics and environment in human development.

85
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:29,160
A Mediterranean diet describes the food typically eaten by people living in countries around

86
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,480
the Mediterranean Sea, including fresh vegetables, olive oil and fish.

87
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,600
At a communal meal, people sit down together to talk and share food.

88
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,400
And finally, a multi-generational household is when people from two or more generations of

89
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:51,000
the same family live together. Once again, our six-minute to wrap.

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,760
