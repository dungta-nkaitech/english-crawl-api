Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Rob.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,719
And I'm Sam.

4
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:24,000
With the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic, people in many countries around the world

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,760
have started wearing face masks to protect both themselves and others they come into contact with.

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,039
In this programme we'll be asking whether wearing masks in public can help prevent

7
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:37,759
the spread of coronavirus in the community.

8
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:54,400
Wearing a protective mask or face covering is nothing new. Medical masks have a long history

9
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,759
from the plagues of medieval Europe to 19th century outbreaks of cholera in the United States.

10
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:06,319
But when did they start to be commonly used? That's my question for today. When and where were

11
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:17,920
face masks first widely used? Was it A, 1855 in Vienna, B, 1905 in Chicago, or C, 1955 in London?

12
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:25,680
Hmm, well you mentioned cholera outbreaks in the US, Rob. So I'll say B, 1905 in Chicago.

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,120
Right, Sam. Where we'll find out later if you are right.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,079
Now face masks may inspire confidence, but what is the evidence that they actually protect the

15
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,200
wearer from contracting the virus or prevent infected people from spreading the virus to others?

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,760
Professor Rob West has conducted a review of over 20 studies looking into the evidence.

17
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,400
Here he is speaking to the BBC World Service Programme Health Check.

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,200
The evidence is equivocal on it. It doesn't really tell you anything yet. I mean,

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,640
hopefully that will change. So we're thrown back on sort of first principles and basics and

20
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,000
this is why I've seen so many other areas of public health. You get such a heated debate because

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,280
people are really relying on their opinion on things and you will have one group who say,

22
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,800
well, it stands to reason. The good old stands to reason argument, which is obviously if you've

23
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,360
got a covering in front of your face and you're speaking or coughing into that covering, it's going

24
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,840
to trap quite a lot of the virus on the droplets that you'll be emitting. So far the evidence

25
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,400
over whether face masks are helpful or harmful is equivocal, difficult to interpret because it

26
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,800
seems to have two opposite or contradictory meanings. Based on current evidence, Professor West

27
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,240
feels we cannot say whether mask wearing is beneficial. Some evidence suggests that wearing

28
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:57,199
masks can prevent the disease spreading and some suggest the opposite. There may be reasons why

29
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:03,039
wearing masks could actually increase the spread of coronavirus. However, for some people,

30
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:10,159
it stands to reason that masks are beneficial, meaning it is obviously true from the facts.

31
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:16,239
Actually, the evidence is far from obvious, but everyone has an opinion on the issue and after

32
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:22,639
weeks of stressful lockdown, this can lead to heated debate, discussion or argument in which people

33
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,639
become angry and excited. Up until recently, the World Health Organization said there were two

34
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:35,519
groups who definitely should wear masks, people showing symptoms of the virus and their carers.

35
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,239
But that left the problem of people who have the virus without knowing it and maybe unintentionally

36
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,759
emitting it, sending something out into the air, for example a noise or smell or in this case

37
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:53,359
coronavirus. In June, the WHO advice changed. Now they say masks should be worn in public where

38
00:03:53,359 --> 00:04:00,399
social distancing measures are not possible. But the advantages of wearing masks might be outweighed

39
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:07,599
by other considerations as Professor West explains. It could also have unfortunate negative

40
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:14,239
consequences in terms of the sort of mask shaming that people feel compelled to wear masks in

41
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,360
situations where it's actually not helpful and maybe harmful because it's expected of them

42
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:25,199
and they feel that they would be judged if they didn't. But I think in addition to that,

43
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,800
one of the problems we have is that masks can potentially create a false sense of security.

44
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:38,560
One negative effect is the practice of mask shaming, criticising or humiliating someone for not

45
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,199
wearing a face covering. Another problem is that wearing masks might create a false sense of

46
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:52,720
security, a feeling of being safer and you really are. Is that what happened in 1905 Rob?

47
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,319
Oh yes, today's quiz question. I asked you when face masks were first widely used.

48
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:07,360
And I said B, 1905 in Chicago. Ah, well done Sam, you were absolutely right. It was 1905 in Chicago

49
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:14,000
when Dr Alice Hamilton first noticed that care as wearing masks to treat scarlet fever patients

50
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,560
did not get sick. Okay, interesting. So today we've been discussing whether wearing masks helps

51
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:28,000
prevent infected people emitting or sending out coronavirus. Well, so far the evidence is

52
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,040
equivocal, unclear because it seems contradictory. In other words, we can't say either way for certain.

53
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:42,480
But for some, it stands to reason, meaning it's obviously true that mask wearing is a good idea.

54
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:48,160
The disagreement over wearing face coverings has started heated debate. That's discussion

55
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,800
which becomes angry or excited. And this in turn has led to incidents of mask shaming,

56
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:02,560
criticising or mocking people for not wearing a face mask. A final drawback is that masks might give

57
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,399
the wearer a false sense of security. That's belief that they are safe when they're not.

58
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,560
And that's all we've got time for today. Bye for now. Bye bye.
