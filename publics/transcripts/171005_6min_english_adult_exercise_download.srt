Hello, I'm Neil and welcome to 6 Minute English, where we vigorously discuss a new topic

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,519
and six related items of vocabulary. And hello, I'm Rob. Today, we're discussing

5
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,600
vigorous exercise and whether adults take enough of it. Vigorous means using a lot of energy

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:38,480
to do something. So how many steps do you do in a day, Rob? How many steps? How should I know,

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,760
Neil? It will be pretty hard to count them all. Come on, you can track steps on your phone.

8
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,200
I do 10,000 a day, which is the magic number for keeping fit and healthy apparently.

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,280
Not if you sawn to Neil, surely. Sauntering from the sofa to the fridge and back, or

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,359
from the house to the car. Well, I never sawn to a rob. Sauntur means to walk slowly,

11
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,519
and you'd have to make a lot of trips to the fridge to clock up 10,000 steps. To get some vigorous

12
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:15,439
exercise, you need to get out and about. Round the park at a brisk pace. Brisk means quick and energetic,

13
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:22,159
the opposite of sauntering. Okay, well, perhaps you can tell me, Neil, how many people aged between

14
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:35,359
40 and 60 do less than 10 minutes brisk walking every month? Is it a 4%? B 14% or C 40%.

15
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,319
I'm going to say 4%, because 10 minutes is such a short amount of time.

16
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:49,840
Indeed. Now, I've got another question for you, Neil. Why is exercise so important? Because

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,719
it sounds pretty boring, counting steps, going to the gym, running on a machine. Well,

18
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:01,920
when you exercise, you stimulate the body's natural repair system. Your body will actually stay younger

19
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,920
if you exercise. That sounds good. Exercise also lowers your risk of developing illnesses,

20
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,560
such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes. Hmm, I'm getting a bit worried now, Neil,

21
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,360
but I don't have enough time to do a thousand steps every day. I'm far too busy.

22
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,120
Well, Rob, now might be a good time to listen to Julia Bradbury. She's a TV presenter and

23
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,240
outdoor walking enthusiast who will explain how she builds walking into her busy life.

24
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,400
I will walk to meetings instead of catching a bus or getting a taxi or a car into meetings.

25
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,480
And I will also, if I can't build that into my working day, if it's a day when I haven't got

26
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,519
meetings, I'm maybe at home with the kids, I will take the time, I will take my kids out with the

27
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,959
buggy and I will definitely do 30, 40 minutes, at least every day, going to the park, going to the

28
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,639
shops, picking up my things on route and really sort of building it into my life, taking the stairs

29
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:07,039
and not taking lifts. All of these kinds of little decisions can intremently build up to creating

30
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:14,400
more walking time in your day. So, if you build something into your day or your life,

31
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,680
you include it from the beginning. And Julia Bradbury has built walking into her day,

32
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:26,399
even though she's very busy too, Rob, you should learn from her. So she walks instead of driving

33
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:33,120
or taking the bus and takes the stairs instead of the lift. Hmm, I could do those things. You could

34
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,879
indeed, before you know it, you'd be doing 10,000 steps because the amount of walking you do in a day

35
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:46,719
builds incrementally. Incrementally means gradually increasing in size. Okay, well, before I think

36
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:53,200
that over, perhaps I could tell you the answer to today's quiz question. Okay, you asked me how many

37
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,439
people age between 40 and 60 do less than 10 minutes brisk walking every month? The options were

38
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:05,439
A4% B14% or C40%

39
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:13,919
and you said 4% but I'm afraid it's actually 40% and that's according to the government body

40
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:19,680
public health England here in the UK. Oh dear, that's a lot more people than I expected

41
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:25,759
but it isn't that surprising. People in all age groups are leading more sedentary lifestyles these

42
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,439
days. Our job is very sedentary which means it involves a lot of sitting and not much exercise.

43
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,879
Well, I might just run on the spot while we go with the new vocabulary we've learned today.

44
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,879
Good plan. First up, we heard vigorous which means using a lot of energy to do something.

45
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,079
Okay, I'm running vigorously on the spot. Great example. And good to see you taking some vigorous

46
00:04:52,159 --> 00:05:00,800
exercise. Number two, saunter means to walk slowly in a relaxed way. When I saw Rob, I sauntered

47
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:08,560
over to say hello. Hi Neil. Number three, brisk means quick and energetic. It's important to take

48
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,360
some brisk exercise every day. Yes, and I'm beginning to realise that that might be true.

49
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,319
Yep, I think you've done enough jogging for today, Rob. You've probably done about a hundred steps.

50
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:26,719
Oh, is that all? Okay, number four, if you build something into something, you include it from

51
00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:32,399
the beginning. It's important to build regular exercise into your daily routine. Very good advice.

52
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,600
Number five is incrementally which means gradually increasing in size.

53
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,079
Incremental is the adjective. The company has been making incremental changes to its pay structure.

54
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:49,759
Does that mean we're getting a pay rise? I doubt it. And finally, number six, sedentary means

55
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,439
sitting a lot and not taking much exercise. For example, it's bad for your health to lead such a

56
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,560
sedentary lifestyle. Ah, do you really know, did Neil? Well, it's time to go now, but if today's

57
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,959
show has inspired you to step out and take more exercise, please let us know by visiting our Twitter,

58
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:11,360
Facebook and YouTube pages and telling us all about it. Goodbye. Bye-bye.
