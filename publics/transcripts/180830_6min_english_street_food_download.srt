00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,240
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Neil

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,440
And I'm Rob.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,679
Rob, you like your food, don't you?

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:20,320
Oh yes.

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,679
Yum yum food!

10
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:23,600
One of my favourite things.

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,679
And what do you think of street food?

12
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:27,039
Oh, I love street food.

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,640
There are some great places in London where you can find delicious foods

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,799
from all over the world, cooked in front of you in market stalls on the street.

15
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,119
It's quite new though, isn't it?

16
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:39,200
Not really a British tradition.

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,719
I guess not, but it seems to be much more popular these days.

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,879
Well, our topic today is street food, but before we tuck into that,

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,079
here is today's question.

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,560
Recently, archaeologists in Jordan discovered what they believe

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,320
is the oldest remains of bread.

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,560
How old is this bread?

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,359
Is it a, 18,000 years old?

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,560
B, 14,000 years old or C, 5,500 years old?

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,439
What do you think?

26
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,519
Hmm, I don't know, but what I do know is I wouldn't really want to try

27
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:11,760
sandwich made from that bread.

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,120
Hmm, might be a bit moldy.

29
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,280
Anyway, I'm going to have a guess then.

31
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,480
I'll go for C, 5,500 years old.

32
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,359
Right, we will find out the answer later in the programme.

33
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,759
Mark Laurie is from the Nationwide Caterer's Association.

34
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,960
He's an expert in the business of street food in the UK.

35
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,240
He appeared on BBC Radio 4's The Food programme

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,719
and was asked how the business of street food has changed in recent years.

37
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:42,000
In his answer, he talks about the areas where there is most growth in street food.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,680
What are those areas?

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,240
It's been phenomenal the growth in street food.

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,439
It's really taken off.

41
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,000
It's really become quite mainstream.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,080
Part of the cultural fabric of the country, really,

43
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,519
or so he's beginning to be certainly in the bigger cities

44
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,840
and increasingly in the sort of provinces, if you like.

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,879
So, where does he say the popularity of street food is growing?

46
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,359
He says that it's in the bigger cities and also in the provinces.

47
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:12,319
The provinces is a word which means the parts of a country outside of the cities.

48
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,280
So essentially, he's saying it's getting more popular everywhere.

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,319
Exactly.

50
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,800
In fact, he says the growth is phenomenal.

51
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,000
This means he thinks the growth is spectacular, really big.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,800
Yes, he says that it's really taken off.

53
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,199
Taken off is one of those phrasal verbs that can be used in many different ways.

54
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:34,000
In this sense, when something takes off, it means it becomes successful and popular.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,759
You know, street food isn't really something you associate with Britain.

56
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,000
Perhaps it's the climate or British food.

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,560
So street food is something that we're now getting used to and enjoying more.

58
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,680
In fact, Mark says that it's now becoming mainstream.

59
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,920
This means that it's no longer something

60
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,799
that is seen as being unusual or different.

61
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:57,439
It's becoming an accepted part of the everyday eating experience.

62
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,799
Well, let's listen again to Mark Laurie talking about the growth of street food in the UK.

63
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:06,399
It's been phenomenal. The growth in street food is really taken off.

64
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:09,039
It's really become quite mainstream.

65
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,119
Part of the cultural fabric of the country, really,

66
00:03:11,119 --> 00:03:14,479
where it's beginning to be certainly in the bigger cities

67
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,799
and increasingly in the provinces, if you like.

68
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,520
Mark Laurie goes on to talk about why street food has become popular.

69
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,800
What kind of food does he say it's not like?

70
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,920
Yeah, it's just really captured the imagination of the public.

71
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,920
It's honest food, it's authentic food, and it's people that you can trust making it.

72
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,760
It's not some microwave food or whatever that you might get in your local pub.

73
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,920
So street food is many things, but what isn't it?

74
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,720
Well, he says that it's not like food you might get in some pubs.

75
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,840
That food, he says, may be some microwave food,

76
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,479
which is food prepared in a microwave oven.

77
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,520
You know, I quite like a microwave meal now and then,

78
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,240
and I reheat my leftovers in the microwave.

79
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,960
But I guess if you were paying for a nice meal,

80
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,840
you wouldn't expect reheated leftovers.

81
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,960
I think the point he's making is that in many places,

82
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,759
the food you're served is not freshly made.

83
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,199
It may be pre-prepared and finished off in a microwave.

84
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,359
Street food, he says, is authentic.

85
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:15,039
Yes, authentic.

86
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,560
It's real, fresh, and cooked right in front of you.

87
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,560
And if it's food from a particular country,

88
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,240
it's probably being prepared by people from that culture.

89
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,399
He also says that this has captured the imagination of the public.

90
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,680
It's something that the public have experienced and thought,

91
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,360
yep, you know, I like this.

92
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,719
This is a great idea.

93
00:04:34,719 --> 00:04:38,000
Well, all this sort of food is making me hungry.

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,680
So let's get the answer to the quiz and review today's vocabulary

95
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,399
before we head off and grab a bite to eat.

96
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,399
We asked about the age of bread

97
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,040
discovered by archaeologists in Jordan.

98
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,839
Was it A, 18,000 years old, B, 14,000 years old,

99
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,360
or C, 5,500 years old?

100
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,319
And I said C, 5,500 years old.

101
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,879
And I'm afraid it's a lot moldier than that.

102
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,519
The answer was 14,000 years.

103
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,360
Ah, very tasty, I'm sure.

104
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,160
Yes, right then, the vocabulary we started off

105
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,040
with the adjective phenomenal to describe something

106
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,680
that is amazing, remarkable and extraordinary.

107
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,560
Then we had to take off a phrasal verb,

108
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,639
which means to become popular.

109
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,120
Street food has really taken off in the UK.

110
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,480
It's become really popular.

111
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,439
And not just in the cities, but also in the provinces,

112
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,080
which is a noun to describe areas of a country

113
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,319
that aren't the major cities.

114
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,560
Something which captures the imagination

115
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,639
is something which makes you interested

116
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,480
and not just for short time.

117
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,800
And one thing which has captured the imagination

118
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,759
of the British public is authentic street food.

119
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,560
Something authentic is real, it's genuine,

120
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,560
it's not a fake or a copy.

121
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,279
And finally, we had microwave food.

122
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:53,519
Food prepared in a microwave oven.

123
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,800
And that kind of food is not seen by summer's authentic.

124
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,959
Well, it's time to eat.

125
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,560
So that's all we have time for today.

126
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,920
