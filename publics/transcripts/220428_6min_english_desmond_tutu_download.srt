Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Sam and I'm Neil.

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,839
In this 6 Minute English, we're celebrating the life of one of modern South Africa's founding

4
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:30,800
fathers, the icon and Nobel laureate at Bishop Desmond Tutsu. Archbishop Tutsu was one of the

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,560
leaders of the non-violent movement to end the system of racial segregation known as apartheid.

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,000
apartheid was enforced against the black population of South Africa by the white minority

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,359
government from 1948 until 1991. It's impossible to imagine South Africa's difficult journey to

8
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:55,359
freedom without Archbishop Desmond Tutsu. While other anti-apartheid leaders, like his close friend

9
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,799
Nelson Mandela, were imprisoned or even killed, Archbishop Tutsu was there at every step of the

10
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:07,039
struggle. The rebellious priest speaking out against the injustices of apartheid. Archbishop Tutsu

11
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:14,239
was a hero of the 20th century. He died in December 2021 and was laid to rest in Cape Town in a state

12
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:20,159
funeral on New Year's Day. In this programme, we'll hear about some important moments from his life

13
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,919
and, as usual, learn some related vocabulary as well. But first, I have a question for you, Neil.

14
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,679
Nelson Mandela was sometimes affectionately called by his clan's name, Mediba. But do you know what

15
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:43,359
nickname Archbishop Desmond Tutsu was given? Was it A, the Des, B, the Bish, or C, the Arch?

16
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,280
I don't know, but I'll guess his nickname was C, the Arch.

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,599
Okay, Neil. We'll find out if that's the correct answer at the end of the programme.

18
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:58,879
Desmond and Pilo Tutsu was born in 1931 in the town of Clirksdorp in Northern South Africa.

19
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:05,439
In this 2014 interview with BBC World Service programme Outlook, he looks back on some of his

20
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:13,199
earliest childhood memories. I had a very happy childhood. I'm a boy,

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,400
child between two girls. My sister sometimes thought that our mother

22
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:31,360
rather spoiled me, pampered me. My mother was not educated much, but she had an incredible

23
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:41,760
loving for people and was very generous. Part of my own unhappiness was

24
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:51,360
precisely that anyone could want to take advantage of such a gracious, gentle, generous person.

25
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,560
As a child, Desmond Tutsu's mother would pamper him, give him special treatment and make him

26
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,280
feel special by doing nice things for him. He also says his mother spoiled him, let him do or have

27
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,759
whatever he wanted. Spoiling a child usually has a bad effect on their character as they grow up,

28
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:17,360
but this doesn't seem to be true for Desmond Tutsu. What upset the young Desmond was how his mother

29
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,960
was treated by some white South Africans who would take advantage of her, treat her unfairly

30
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:29,280
for their own benefit. In 1955, Desmond Tutsu married his wife, Leah. They had children and the

31
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,120
family moved to London for a time before returning to South Africa when Desmond was made Dean of

32
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,800
Johannesburg. He knew that returning to a racially segregated South Africa would be difficult for

33
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:47,520
his family. In this interview with BBC World Service Programme Outlook, Archbishop Tutsu remembers

34
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,480
one terrifying incident involving his wife, Leah, who had gone to the Johannesburg traffic

35
00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:01,599
department to renew a car license. The handcuffs here, and they walked with him in the street,

36
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:09,039
often she was paraded, and then when the court case was heard, my wife was acquitted,

37
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:19,279
but they had done what they wanted to do, which was to humiliate her and in the process hit at me.

38
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:30,239
I have to say that I found those actions near unforgivable because I was the one who

39
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,199
was out in the forefront, although Leah, she's a toughie.

40
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:46,000
Police officers arrested and handcuffed Leah to humiliate her, make a feel ashamed and stupid.

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,199
When she went to court, Leah was acquitted, declared not guilty of committing a crime,

42
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,040
but the police continued to harass her even though his wife was in his own words a toughie,

43
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,639
someone who is tough and determined. Archbishop Tutsu describes the event as

44
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:09,279
near unforgivable, but in fact he did forgive the white police officers, and in 1991,

45
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:14,399
at the end of a part-ide, he started the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,

46
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,319
as a way of healing divisions between black and white communities.

47
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,879
What an inspirational life, but we still don't know what his nickname was, Sam.

48
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:28,560
Right, in my question, I asked Neil what Archbishop Desmond Tutsu's nickname was?

49
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,239
I guessed it was the arch.

50
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,560
Which was the correct answer.

51
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,479
Affectionately known as the arch, Desmond Tutsu will be remembered as a man of peace and forgiveness.

52
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,319
Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this program, starting with Pampa.

53
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,399
To give someone special treatment.

54
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,800
If you spoil a child, you let them do whatever they want, but be careful,

55
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,680
because they might take advantage of you, treat you badly for their own benefit.

56
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,079
To humiliate someone means to make them feel ashamed or stupid.

57
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,159
If you are acquitted of a crime, it is judged that you are not guilty.

58
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:11,279
And finally, a toughie is a slang word to describe someone like Archbishop Desmond Tutsu or his wife,

59
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,839
Leah, who is tough and determined.

60
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,599
Once again, our six minutes are up.

61
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:16,559
Goodbye for now.

62
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:17,039
Bye.
