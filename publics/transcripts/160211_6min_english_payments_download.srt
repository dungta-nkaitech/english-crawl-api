5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,120
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Alice.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,199
And I'm Neil. Alice, if you've got two pounds, I've forgot my wallet and I need a coffee.

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,480
I've only got these pennies.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,280
Sorry, I always use my bank card in the cafeteria.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,519
You use a card to buy coffee?

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,239
Yes, it's a tap and go card, so it's quick.

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,479
You don't enter your pin number and everyone in the coffee queue uses them, except you.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,920
And today's show is about how we pay for things.

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, I pay for things with money.

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,879
There are different kinds of money.

15
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,399
You're behind the curve digging around in your pockets for change, Neil.

16
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,239
Do you still use checks, too?

17
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,560
Yes, I do. Ches are very useful.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,879
Now, being behind the curve means not keeping up with current trends.

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,320
So, help me keep up, Alice. What's a tap and go card?

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,120
I thought you were talking about your regular bank card.

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,120
Well, tap and go cards are regular bank cards, but with a built-in chip and antenna.

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,240
The card reader sends out a radio frequency,

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,439
and when you bring the card close to the reader, the antenna picks up the signal to make the payment.

24
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,480
Hmm, this antenna business doesn't sound secure.

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,320
An antenna is used for sending or receiving radio signals.

26
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:27,039
Doesn't it mean your personal data is flying around in the ether for everyone to steal?

27
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:32,479
In this context, ether means the air, where electronic communication happens,

28
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,879
and nothing's flying around Peter Pan.

29
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,039
At less than half a second per transaction, there's no time for anyone to steal your cash.

30
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:44,159
Now, why don't you answer today's quiz question?

31
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:48,879
Which man's face appears on a UK £10 note?

32
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:51,759
Is it a child's Darwin?

33
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:58,079
B, Isaac Newton, or C, Albert Einstein.

34
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,000
None of them. It's the Queen.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,199
No, Neil. The Queen is on one side, but on the other side of each note is an important historical figure.

36
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:09,519
Oh, really? I've never noticed.

37
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:13,039
Okay, I'll go for B, Isaac Newton. He's a historical figure.

38
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,319
Hmm, well, so are Darwin and Einstein.

39
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,039
And coins and banknotes will be historical soon,

40
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,359
but we'll find out if you're right later on.

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,120
I'm still concerned about tap and go. What if someone steals my card?

42
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,360
Each contactless payment is limited to a certain amount.

43
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,360
The UK's limit is £30.

44
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,720
After you've used your card a few times in a row, you have to enter your pin.

45
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,920
And if a thief does go on a spending spree with your card,

46
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,080
your bank covers you against fraud.

47
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,840
Whereas if someone steals your banknotes, that's your bad luck.

48
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,280
Okay, good points.

49
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,840
Fraud means getting money by cheating people.

50
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,920
And a spending spree is a short period of time where you do a lot of shopping.

51
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,439
Are you a big spender, Alice?

52
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,199
Not with my tap and go, Neil.

53
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:59,039
How about you in your checkbook?

54
00:02:59,039 --> 00:02:59,840
No comment.

55
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,080
Moving on.

56
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,280
If getting your bankcard out seems like too much trouble,

57
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,159
there's now a solution with wearable tech.

58
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,159
That's clothing and accessories that include computer and electronic technologies.

59
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,479
Let's hear what Kenneth Cukia, a technology expert, has to say.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,400
You can simply take any wireless card and the chip from it,

61
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,400
that your bank might issue you and you can put it into the coat.

62
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,639
And then when you want to make a payment, just simply wave your arm in front of the terminal

63
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,639
and leave with your latte.

64
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:34,879
This is intended for people who are incredibly lazy,

65
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,360
who don't want to take their card out of their wallet,

66
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,680
or use their phone or use their watch.

67
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,120
People are going to be making more purchases, more of the time,

68
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,120
particularly for small value goods.

69
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,400
What Kenneth Cukia said is very interesting.

70
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,000
That sounds tempting, but I'm still concerned about how safe this all is.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,280
What if I wave my arm around and make a payment by mistake?

72
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,319
The chip has to get very close to the card reader to make a payment,

73
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,840
so that's not likely to happen.

74
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,840
Now, companies are creating new biometric technology,

75
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,319
which you might like, Neil, because it combines payment and security technology.

76
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,879
Let's hear more from the BBC reporter Kate Russell.

77
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,759
For those times when not even carrying a phone is convenient,

78
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,240
at the beach or a festival, for example,

79
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,360
the finger pay system reads the unique maps of veins under the surface of your finger.

80
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,000
The trick is remembering which finger you registered with.

81
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,600
This high-tech stuff reporter Kate Russell is talking about is amazing.

82
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,319
Someday soon we won't have to carry a wallet or a purse or anything.

83
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,360
The veins in our finger will authenticate payments

84
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,960
and prove the payments are ours.

85
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,319
I can't wait.

86
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,800
Sounds a bit too sci-fi for my liking.

87
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,600
How about giving us the answer to today's quiz question?

88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,560
All right, then.

89
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,520
I asked which man's face appears on a UK £10 note?

90
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,720
Is it a child's Darwin,

91
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,759
b, Isaac Newton,

92
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,280
or c, Albert Einstein?

93
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,800
And I said b, Isaac Newton?

94
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,319
Yes, and you were wrong, Neil.

95
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,639
It was that other famous person, a, child's Darwin.

96
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,439
Isaac Newton was on the old £1 note, which is no longer used.

97
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:21,839
And Einstein was German, not British,

98
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,399
so he wouldn't appear on a UK bank note anyway.

99
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,399
Ah, well, they look similar, I think.

100
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,879
Can you tell us today's words once again, Alice?

101
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:29,920
Yes, of course I can.

102
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,039
They are.

103
00:05:32,719 --> 00:05:33,839
Behind the curve.

104
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:36,560
Tap and go.

105
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:39,360
Antenna.

106
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:41,759
Ether.

107
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,399
Fraud.

108
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,519
Spending spree.

109
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,480
Wearable tech.

110
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,439
Authenticate.

111
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,759
Well, that's the end of this edition of 6 Minute English.

112
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,159
