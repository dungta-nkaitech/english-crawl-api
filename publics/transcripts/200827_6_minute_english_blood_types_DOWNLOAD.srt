Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

4
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:17,920
And I'm Sam.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,400
Sam, what blood type are you?

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,640
Ah, you mean the different groups used to classify humans by blood?

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,120
Types A, B, A, B and O.

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,399
I think I'm type O.

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,880
How about you, Neil?

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,439
Well, it may sound strange, but actually I don't know.

11
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,719
Hmm, yeah, lots of Westerners don't know their blood type.

12
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,840
But in parts of Asia, blood groups are a topic of daily conversation.

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,240
People select romantic partners based on blood type

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,159
and different blood groups are associated with different personalities.

15
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:56,399
In this programme, we'll be finding out all about blood,

16
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,759
why humans have different blood types,

17
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:03,879
and whether blood is something more than just a way of pumping oxygen around your body.

18
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:07,280
And of course, we'll be learning some new vocabulary as well.

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,560
Now, Neil, I have an interesting fact for you.

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,479
Did you know that many Japanese pop stars' websites

21
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,079
will feature their blood type alongside information like their age and hobbies?

22
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,280
I didn't say them, but Japanese culture is certainly interested in blood.

23
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,840
There's even a word, brujara, meaning blood harassment,

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,759
which is used to describe hostility towards people

25
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,679
from a certain blood group considered to be selfish.

26
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:35,959
But which group?

27
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:38,039
That's my quiz question for today.

28
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:42,120
Which blood types may fall victim to brujara?

29
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,359
Is it A, blood type A, B, blood type B,

30
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,200
or C, blood type O?

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,319
I'll say A, blood type A.

32
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:56,079
OK, Sam, we'll find out the answer later.

33
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,319
Now, as we've heard, blood is a big deal in Japan.

34
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,480
Mane Chesterton from BBC World Service Programme,

35
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,640
Crowd Science, travel to Tokyo,

36
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,560
where she asked Japanese translators,

37
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,800
Chia Kobayashi, to explain more.

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,319
For blood type A, generally, it is thought they are perfectionists,

39
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,519
more detailed-oriented, pretty much a good-at-precise type of job.

40
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:23,199
And that makes them good at helping others,

41
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,759
and good at teamwork, and respect rules and customs.

42
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:29,039
That's a typical blood type.

43
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,000
40% of Japan's population are sensitive anxious type A's.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,680
30% are curious and stubborn, generous type O's,

45
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,359
10% are creative A, B's,

46
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:43,759
but woe-betied the 20% type B,

47
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,359
because they have a far less desirable personality, apparently.

48
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:50,359
According to Japanese tradition,

49
00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:53,479
blood type A's are perfectionists,

50
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,840
people who want everything to be perfect

51
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,039
and demand the highest standards possible.

52
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,799
This contrasts with type O's who are considered to be stubborn,

53
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:05,519
people who are determined to do what they want

54
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,519
and refuse to change their mind.

55
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,919
But it's unfortunate blood type B's

56
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,479
who have the least desirable personality,

57
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:14,599
selfish and independent.

58
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,919
Woe-betied the type B's

59
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,679
remarks the presenter, Manny Chesterton.

60
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:21,759
An informal British expression

61
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:25,039
said when they will be trouble ahead for someone.

62
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,560
In this case, poor type B's.

63
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,879
But apart from customs and traditions,

64
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,159
is there actually any science behind these beliefs?

65
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,199
Well, not according to Dr Emma Pomoraya

66
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,159
Cambridge University's archaeology department.

67
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,400
She thinks that, like horoscopes,

68
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,960
there's no scientific basis for a connection

69
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,479
between blood types and personalities.

70
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:51,240
Which makes me wonder what exactly blood types are.

71
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,599
Blood types are kinds of stickers

72
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,519
or chemical markers which support our immune system.

73
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,280
The organs, cells and processes

74
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,400
which protect the human body from infection and illness.

75
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,199
Those chemical markers can identify foreign bodies

76
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,560
like pathogens,

77
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,759
small organisms such as a virus or bacteria

78
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,479
that can cause disease.

79
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:16,120
The variety of blood types seems to be a result

80
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,920
of different bodily responses

81
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,120
to different disease-causing pathogens.

82
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,639
Which explains why blood of the same type

83
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,160
is needed in blood transfusions.

84
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,840
Medical procedures in which blood is taken from one person

85
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,319
and put into another person's body.

86
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,759
Often after an accident or during an operation.

87
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,360
And explains the high demand for type O blood,

88
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,759
which can be given to anyone.

89
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,639
Ah, generous typos.

90
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,240
Like me, I always knew I was special.

91
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,439
And curious and stubborn, wasn't that the type O personality?

92
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,439
Oh yes.

93
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,920
Today's quiz question was about blood type personalities.

94
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,360
I asked you which undesirable blood type

95
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,680
is considered selfish in Japan.

96
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,720
And I said, A, blood type A.

97
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,840
But as we've heard, it's actually B, blood type B.

98
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:07,839
Never mind.

99
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,839
I'll settle for being curious, stubborn and generous.

100
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,519
In today's program, we've been talking all about blood types

101
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:17,839
and personalities in Japan.

102
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,479
Blood type A people are thought of as perfectionists,

103
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:24,439
people who want everything to be perfect.

104
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:27,000
Unlike type O's who are considered stubborn,

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,959
determined to get their own way and unwilling to change.

106
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,919
And woe be tied, selfish type B's.

107
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:34,959
An informal expression said,

108
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,199
when they will be trouble for someone,

109
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,159
or if they will be punished for doing a particular thing.

110
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:45,319
Scientifically speaking, blood types help support our immune system,

111
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,039
the organs and cellular processes,

112
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:51,759
which protect the human body from infection.

113
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,439
They also help identify foreign pathogens,

114
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,599
small organisms such as a virus or bacteria

115
00:05:57,599 --> 00:05:59,279
that can cause a disease.

116
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,799
And explain why the same blood type is needed

117
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:04,039
for a successful blood transfusion.

118
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,480
And that's the procedure in which blood is transferred

119
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,960
from one person's body to another during an operation.

120
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,040
And that's all we have time for today.

121
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,960
Bye bye for now.

122
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,800
Goodbye.
