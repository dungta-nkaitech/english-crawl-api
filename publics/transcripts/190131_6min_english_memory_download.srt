00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,200
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,199
This is the programme where in just 6 minutes we discuss an interesting topic

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,760
and teach some related English vocabulary.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,359
Enjoying me to do this is Rob.

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,240
Hello. Sorry, Neil. How long did you say this programme is?

10
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:30,639
6 minutes. It's 6 Minute English, Rob.

11
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:33,519
Right. Okay. Sorry. What's your name again?

12
00:00:33,519 --> 00:00:37,200
Neil. My name's Neil, Rob. What's happened to your memory?

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,759
Sorry, Neil. Too many things on my mind. It's affecting my short-term memory.

14
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,799
But what I can remember is that in this programme we're talking about improving our memory.

15
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,280
We are, and I think you might find it quite useful.

16
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,480
Storing information is an important function of our brains and scientists are always looking at ways

17
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,799
to improve it, but also to stop it deteriorating or becoming worse.

18
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,839
Yes. And we all know that memories, that's the noun for things we remember from the past,

19
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:08,000
are nice to have, but also important for remembering who people are,

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,239
where things are kept and how things look.

21
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:15,280
Soon we'll be discussing a new idea for improving your memory, but not before I've set today's

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,199
quiz question. There are many ways we can improve our memory, but one way is through the type of

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,439
food we eat. According to the BBC Food website, which type of food supports good memory function?

24
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,680
Is it a, eggs, b, spinach or sea bananas?

25
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,599
Well, as a kid I was always told that spinach was good for me, pop I ate it to make him strong,

26
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,680
so I'll say b, spinach.

27
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,079
Well, I'll have the answer later on.

28
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,520
Now let's talk more about improving our memory. Memory is the ability to encode,

29
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,799
recall information, but a number of factors can affect people's memory processes,

30
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,159
including health, anxiety, mood, stress and tiredness.

31
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,599
That's why, for example, if you're taking an exam, it's important to get a good night's sleep

32
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,560
and to keep healthy. But Neil, when you're revising for an exam, what helps you to remember facts?

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,680
I tend to write things down again and again and again and again.

34
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,919
Ah, well, that's one way, but people have different styles to help them remember.

35
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,000
According to the BBC's iWonderGuide, there are three different styles,

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,959
visual, auditory and kinesthetic. That's learning by doing and practicing something over and over again.

37
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,159
That sounds like me.

38
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,959
But recently a new study has come up with a method that could possibly be the best way to improve

39
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,560
your memory, and that's by drawing. Darryl O'Connor, whose professor of psychology at the University

40
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,199
of Leeds has been speaking about it on the BBC Radio 4 program all in the mind.

41
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,799
See if you can work out why.

42
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:50,079
The authors certainly argue that one of the things that happens is by drawing these particular objects

43
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:57,599
that it leads to this increased contextual representation of the object in one's mind.

44
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,359
It makes a lot of intuitive sense, the idea that if you have encoded something in a greater

45
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:08,479
level of detail, it's like you're more likely to remember it. It's much stronger than just

46
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,039
remembering that writing down the words.

47
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:18,560
Okay, so let's try to explain that. Drawing something leads to increased contextual

48
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,719
representation of the object, but something is contextual. It is in the situation where it usually

49
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:30,000
exists. So as you draw something, you're creating a picture in your mind about what it is,

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,199
how you use it, and where it's used. I wonder if this means artists have good memories.

51
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:40,399
Maybe Darryl O'Connor says that when you draw, you are encoding something in a greater level

52
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:46,639
of detail, more than you would by just writing things down. Encoding is changing information into

53
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:52,239
a form that can be stored and later recalled. That's because as you draw, you're thinking about

54
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,639
different aspects of the object. He says it makes intuitive sense. Intuitive means it's based on

55
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:04,079
feelings rather than facts or proof, so you just feel it's the best thing to do. Of course,

56
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,600
this is just one more way to improve your memory. I have also heard that doing crossword puzzles and

57
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,360
Sudoku can help, especially when you're older. Yes, as we get older, we can often have more difficulty

58
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,720
retrieving information from our memory, and people with Alzheimer's find it very difficult to

59
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,480
encode information. So anyway, to keep our memory working is a good thing. Basically, we need

60
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,759
brain training. Brain training and eating the right food, Rob. You might remember that earlier I

61
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:38,240
asked you, according to the BBC Food website, which type of food supports good memory function?

62
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:46,159
Is it a, eggs, b, spinach or c, bananas? And Rob, you said, I do remember and I said b, spinach.

63
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:52,560
And that is sort of the wrong answer. In fact, they were all correct. They are all examples of food

64
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,639
that can help support good memory. Apparently, foods rich in b vitamins are important as they provide

65
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,159
protection for the brain as we age and support good memory function. I think it's time to change my

66
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:09,680
diet. Now, once in the vocabulary we looked at in this program. So today we've been talking about

67
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,839
our memory. We use our memory to remember things and memories is the noun for things we remember

68
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:21,680
from the past. Then we discussed a learning style known as kinesthetic, that is learning by doing

69
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,039
and practicing something over and over again. We heard from Professor Darryl O'Connor who talked

70
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:33,120
about contextual representation. When something is contextual, you see it in the situation where it

71
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,200
usually exists. Next, we talked about encoding, that is, changing information into a form that can

72
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:45,920
be stored and later recalled. And we mentioned intuitive sense. Having an intuitive sense means doing

73
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,439
something based on feelings rather than facts or proof. So you just feel it's the best thing to do.

74
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:56,400
And finally, we mentioned Alzheimer's, a disease affecting the brain that makes it difficult to

75
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:01,120
remember things and it gets worse as you get older. Well, there are lots of new words to remember

76
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,199
there, but that's all for this program. Don't forget to visit us on Facebook, Twitter,
