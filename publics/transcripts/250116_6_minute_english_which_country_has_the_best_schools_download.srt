2
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:12,160
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Phil.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,919
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:20,559
So, Beth, we're talking about the best education systems in the world today.

5
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:26,000
You went to school here in Britain. What do you think of the British education system? Do you think it could be the best?

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:37,600
Mmm, I think that is quite good. There's probably a couple of things that I personally would change about it, but I would say it's quite good, but maybe not the best in the world.

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,079
Well, in this programme, we're going to be talking about the PISA rankings.

8
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:50,480
The rankings are based on tests carried out by the OECD. That's an international organisation every three years.

9
00:00:50,479 --> 00:01:00,000
The tests attempt to show which countries are the most effective at teaching maths, science and reading, but it's really possible to measure.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,400
Well, here is former BBC education correspondent Sean Cochlan talking to BBC World Service programme, the Global Story.

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:19,519
When they were introduced first, well, that was a very contentious idea because people said, how can you possibly compare big countries? How can you compare America to Luxembourg or to parts of China or whatever?

12
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:29,439
Sean said that the tests were contentious. If something is contentious, then it's something that people might argue about. It's controversial.

13
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:36,959
So at first, PISA tests were contentious because not everyone believed it was fair to compare very different countries.

14
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:48,079
Phil, I've got a question for you about them. So in 2022, Singapore was top of the reading rankings, but which of these countries came second?

15
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,839
Was it A, the USA? B, Ireland or C, the UK?

16
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:56,639
I think it might be B, Ireland.

17
00:01:56,639 --> 00:02:01,119
Okay, well, we will find out if that's correct at the end of the programme.

18
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:08,400
A common pattern in the PISA rankings is that the most successful countries tend to be smaller.

19
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:19,040
Talking to BBC World Service programme, the Global Story, Sean Cochlan tells us that many large countries from Western Europe don't score that highly in the rankings.

20
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:29,439
They've been outpaced and outperformed by these fast upcoming countries, in Singapore or Estonia or Taiwan or those sort of places,

21
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,520
which we don't historically think of as being economic rivals.

22
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:41,120
But I suppose the argument for the PISA test is if you want to have a knowledge economy and economy based on skills, this is how you measure it.

23
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,280
We heard that many large European countries are being outpaced by smaller nations.

24
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,599
If someone outpaces you, they're going faster than you at a higher pace.

25
00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:00,159
We use the prefix out to say that someone or something is better at doing something.

26
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,639
We also heard that smaller nations are outperforming larger ones. They're performing better.

27
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:14,079
Singapore, Estonia and Taiwan are described as economic rivals to large European nations.

28
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:17,599
That means that they are competing with them economically.

29
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,479
We also heard about a knowledge economy.

30
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:30,879
This is an economy based on service industries that require workers to be highly educated, such as IT, finance or advanced engineering.

31
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,439
So what makes countries perform better in these tests?

32
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,319
Let's hear again from BBC World Service programme, the Global Story.

33
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:48,079
Sean Cochlan tells us that those countries that prioritise getting everyone to a certain level do well.

34
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,320
We also hear from Rando Kustik, an Estonian school principal.

35
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,200
Countries which make sure that all their pupils get through a certain level of education to a certain standard,

36
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
regardless of their background do well.

37
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:08,640
If you are teaching them a different level of abilities, then you are segregating them.

38
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,120
And we don't want to segregate any people in the world,

39
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,520
why we are doing that in the schools.

40
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,959
This one of the main things, why the stone is successful.

41
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,280
Sean said the most successful systems educate everyone to a particular standard,

42
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,040
regardless of their background.

43
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,040
If one thing happens regardless of something else,

44
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,600
it means that there's something else is not important or not a problem.

45
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:42,079
Rando Kustik said that Estonian schools do not want to segregate students.

46
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,120
Segregate means to separate and keep apart.

47
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,120
So we've just heard about Estonia, but what about your question, Beth?

48
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,439
What about those countries?

49
00:04:53,439 --> 00:05:02,479
Ah, I asked you which out of the USA, Ireland and the UK came second for reading in the 2022

50
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,759
PISA rankings.

51
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,680
You said Ireland and that was the correct answer, well done.

52
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this program about education rankings,

53
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,840
starting with contentious, argued about or controversial.

54
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,639
If you're outpaced by someone, they're going faster than you are.

55
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,800
Rivals are competitors.

56
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:30,319
A knowledge economy is one based on industries that need highly educated workers,

57
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,920
such as IT, finance or advanced engineering.

58
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,920
If something happens regardless of a second thing,

59
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,879
the second thing has no impacts on it happening.

60
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,200
And finally, if people are segregated, different groups of people are separated and kept apart.

61
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,240
