From BBC Learning English

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,480
Hello, I'm Sam and welcome to 6 Minute English.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,120
This is the programme where in just 6 minutes,

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,120
we discuss an interesting topic

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,760
and teach some related English vocabulary.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,679
Joining me to do this is Rob.

10
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,920
Hello, and today we're talking about fraud.

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,280
Fraud is the criminal activity of getting money

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,320
by deceiving people or tricking people

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,160
by doing something dishonest.

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,600
There are many ways to do this

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,400
and much of it is happening online these days.

16
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,640
We'll talk more about this in a moment,

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,400
but first a very honest quiz question for you to answer, Rob.

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,040
According to UK Finance,

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,799
an organisation that represents the British banking industry,

20
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:57,200
how much money did criminals steal

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,600
through fraud and scams last year?

22
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,560
Was it a, 1.2 million pounds?

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,920
b, 120 million,

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,719
or c, 1.2 billion pounds?

25
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,439
Well, I imagine it's quite a lot,

26
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,000
so I'll say 120 million pounds.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,200
Okay, we'll find out if you're right later in the programme.

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,760
Now, I just mentioned the word scam,

29
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,840
which is an illegal way of making money

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,280
by tricking someone.

31
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,319
We may think that will never be scammed,

32
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,240
but already millions of people

33
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,000
have fallen for fake emails,

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,119
funcalls or letters that look genuine

35
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,399
and ask us to give or update our financial details.

36
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,679
To fall for means to believe something

37
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:42,640
that is a trick or a lie, to be true.

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,919
This year, for example,

39
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:45,759
thousands of people in the UK

40
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,479
fell for a fraudulent or fake email,

41
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,759
requesting that people update their direct debit details

42
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,599
for paying their TV licence.

43
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,679
That's a payment we have to make in the UK

44
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:56,799
to fund the BBC.

45
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,480
And this is something the BBC Radio 4 programme

46
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,560
you and yours has been discussing.

47
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,679
It's BBC fraud investigator reporter,

48
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:09,199
Sherry Val, explained why it was easy to be deceived.

49
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:12,159
It's a sleight of hand fraud.

50
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:14,800
The criminals get you to look over there

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,159
whilst they rifle your pockets,

52
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,599
and I have the email here.

53
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,159
It looks completely convincing.

54
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,639
All the right logos, all the right fonts,

55
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,039
it just says that my direct debit

56
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,759
or my TV licence has failed and I need to pay it.

57
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,120
It's very polite.

58
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,199
So some great language there.

59
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,799
She said that this scam was a sleight of hand fraud.

60
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:38,479
Slight of hand means the use of clever skill

61
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,719
to gain something dishonestly.

62
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,239
In this case, money.

63
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,280
As Sherry said,

64
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,959
the criminals get you to metaphorically look over there

65
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,120
whilst they rifle your pockets.

66
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,879
Rifle means search something

67
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,479
in order to steal from it.

68
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,399
So to steal from your pocket,

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,680
very dishonest.

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,240
Now, like in this case, fraudsters,

71
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,159
the people who commit fraud,

72
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,960
gained financial information by fishing.

73
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,200
That's not fishing using a rod, line and hook,

74
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,960
but by sending an email that looked like it came from your bank,

75
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,240
asking for confidential information.

76
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,480
But banks do warn us not to give away our financial details online

77
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,719
and to change our passwords regularly.

78
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,840
But sometimes criminals are very clever in what they do,

79
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,520
and it's easy to be fooled.

80
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,560
The You and Yours programme also heard about this

81
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,200
from social engineer Jenny Radcliffe.

82
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,680
What does she call this type of fraud?

83
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,680
The more sophisticated frauds are ones

84
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,319
that have been thought through very carefully.

85
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,840
And this has been thought through

86
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,680
is a fraud that can be layered.

87
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,560
So you know, we're getting some information from you.

88
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,400
What you really look for is a window into someone a key

89
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,800
that unlocks you to a small part of their identity

90
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,400
or their personal data

91
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,680
and from that a good, probable build and build and build on it

92
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,439
until the consequences so some people can be completely devastated.

93
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,960
So Jenny Radcliffe is talking about sophisticated fraud.

94
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,920
That means it's clever and often complicated,

95
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,439
so it can confuse us.

96
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,759
Yes, criminals need just a small piece of information about us,

97
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,360
a key that can eventually open up our identity

98
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,439
and expose our personal data.

99
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,000
And as Jenny says, for the victims of fraud,

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,360
the consequences, the outcome, can be very bad,

101
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,720
especially if somebody loses all their hard-earned savings.

102
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,720
It can be devastating.

103
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,120
Of course banks and security companies are working hard to beat the criminals,

104
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,199
but it still remains a problem.

105
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,199
An earlier, I asked you, Rob,

106
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,040
according to UK Finance,

107
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,680
how much money did criminals steal through fraud and scams last year?

108
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,680
And I said, be Â£120 million, that's a lot of money.

109
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,319
It is, but it's even more.

110
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,360
In 2018, criminals successfully stole 1.2 billion

111
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,639
through fraud and scams, and that's just in the UK.

112
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,319
Globally, it's even more.

113
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,160
Well, it certainly is a serious issue,

114
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,480
but hopefully we haven't deceived you

115
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,800
with the vocabulary we've discussed today.

116
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,319
Hopefully not.

117
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,399
We've been talking about fraud.

118
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,040
That's the criminal activity of getting money

119
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,759
by deceiving people or tricking people

120
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,759
by doing something dishonest.

121
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,279
Next, we had scam,

122
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,480
which is an illegal or dishonest way of making money

123
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,839
by tricking someone.

124
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,240
The people who do it are scammers.

125
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,920
We talked about the phrasal verb,

126
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,959
fall for.

127
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,399
When you fall for something,

128
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,560
you believe something that is a trick or a lie to be true.

129
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,120
Then we heard about slight of hand,

130
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,360
which means use of clever skill

131
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
to gain something dishonestly,

132
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,000
and rifle, which means search something

133
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,839
in order to steal from it.

134
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,480
Fishing, spelt with a ph,

135
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,439
means tricking someone by email or online

136
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:53,360
to get their personal data

137
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,680
by pretending to be from your bank.

138
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,959
Finally, we discussed sophisticated fraud.

139
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,800
When something is sophisticated,

140
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,839
it's clever and often complicated.

141
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,439
Unlike our programme, Sam.

142
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,639
Let's hope so, but now we've reached the end of our programme.

143
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,720
See you again soon. Bye.

144
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,519
Bye.
