00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,040
Hello, this is 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,320
And I'm Georgina.

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,879
In this program, we're focusing on the topic of mental health at work.

6
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,080
Yes, it's an issue that can be difficult to see.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,560
If someone has an injury like a broken leg or a serious medical issue,

8
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,519
it's obvious and we can understand what's happening.

9
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,759
With mental health issues, though, there's no physical sign and people who are experiencing difficulties.

10
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,840
Maybe don't get the same understanding as people who have medical problems.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,200
It's a topic that has been getting more publicity recently,

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,519
particularly as members of the British Royal Family have been talking about it.

13
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:54,079
Also, awareness is raised through events such as World Mental Health Day.

14
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,239
And that is the topic of our quiz.

15
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,160
World Mental Health Day is held every year on October 10th.

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,039
It aims to raise awareness of mental health issues

17
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,680
and their effects on people's lives.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,359
In what year was it first held?

19
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:12,960
Was it A, 1992, B, 2002 or C, 2012?

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,400
What do you think, Georgina?

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,359
I don't know.

22
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,960
I think it will be older than 2012.

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,159
But as old as 1992, I don't know.

24
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,960
I'm going to go with 2002.

25
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:27,839
OK, well, I'll have the answer later in the program

26
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:29,679
and we'll see if you're right.

27
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:34,079
Mental health problems are very difficult personally for those who suffer from them

28
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,119
and they also have an impact on businesses.

29
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,599
Paul Farmer is head of the Mental Health Awareness Charity Mind.

30
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,159
He spoke on the BBC World Service Business Daily Programme about this.

31
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,119
How much does he say it costs businesses in the UK?

32
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,639
We know that the cost of failing to address mental health in business

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,599
is colossal.

34
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:01,920
In the UK, it costs between £33,000 to £42 billion a year, about £50 billion dollars

35
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,799
and around about 300,000 people fall out of work every year

36
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,560
as a result of poor mental health.

37
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,960
So it's a huge cost to workplaces and to individuals.

38
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:19,120
Behind those numbers, though, are the lives of talented, able contributors

39
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,759
who often just slide away from the workplace

40
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,799
because they don't get the right help and support for their mental health.

41
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:28,319
What figures did Paul Farmer give there?

42
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,319
He gave the figure of about between £33 and £42 billion,

43
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,479
which is about £50 billion dollars.

44
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,079
That's a lot of money.

45
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,479
It is. In fact, he called it colossal.

46
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,039
This adjective means huge, really, really big.

47
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,439
This is the cost to business he says are failing to address the mental health issue.

48
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,280
Failing to address means ignoring or not dealing with the problems.

49
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,520
It leads to staff leaving work and he says these people are contributors.

50
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,680
They give something to the business in terms of their skill and experience.

51
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,840
And because of the mental health issues, which code to be addressed but aren't,

52
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,639
those contributors are being lost to the business.

53
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,120
So it costs companies more money to recruit and train new staff

54
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,000
and you can't always replace the experience that is lost.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,199
Let's listen again.

56
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,439
We know that the cost of failing to address mental health in business is colossal.

57
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:29,679
In the UK, it costs between £33 and £42 billion a year, about £50 billion dollars.

58
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:36,479
And around about 300,000 people fall out of work every year as a result of poor mental health.

59
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,879
So it's a huge cost to workplaces and to individuals.

60
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,879
Behind those numbers, though, are the lives of talented, able contributors.

61
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:51,199
Who often just slide away from the workplace because they don't get the right

62
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,359
help and support for their mental health.

63
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:58,079
In recent years, it seems as if there has been more understanding of mental health issues,

64
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:01,439
not just in the workplace but in society as a whole.

65
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,599
Jeff McDonald is a campaigner for the organisation, mines at work.

66
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,479
He spoke on the business daily programme about one way that things are getting a little better.

67
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,639
I think what's really changed is people telling their stories and the more stories that we tell

68
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,120
it kind of begins to normalise this.

69
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,680
Every single story that we tell is like sending a lifeboat out into the ocean

70
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,360
and the millions and millions of people who are suffering in silence.

71
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,639
Do you know what they do?

72
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,560
They cling onto that lifeboat and they realise they're not alone and they might just be normal.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,800
So because more people are talking about this issue, it begins to normalise it.

74
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
This means it becomes normal.

75
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,600
It's not unusual, strange or hidden.

76
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,879
There are people who suffer in silence, they keep to themselves and hide their problems from others.

77
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:53,760
But because there is more publicity about this topic,

78
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,480
they can begin to feel that they are not alone and they don't have to suffer in silence.

79
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,520
People sharing their stories are like lifeboats for those who do suffer in silence.

80
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,720
In this metaphor, they can cling onto the lifeboats.

81
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,760
Right, we are going to have another look at our vocabulary.

82
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,960
But first, let's have the answer to the quiz.

83
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,079
When was the first world mental health day?

84
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:21,519
Was it A, 1992, B, 2002 or C, 2012?

85
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:23,199
Georgina, what did you say?

86
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,120
I thought it was 2002.

87
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,759
It was actually earlier, 1992.

88
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,759
Now, a review of our vocabulary.

89
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:35,759
Failing to address is a phrase that means ignoring a problem or not trying to help with a problem.

90
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,799
Something colossal is very, very big.

91
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,600
A contributor is someone who has something to give,

92
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,360
who is a positive benefit to, in this case, a business.

93
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,600
Then we have the verb to normalize, meaning to make something normal.

94
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,800
Someone who suffers in silence doesn't talk about their problems and may hide them from others.

95
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,439
And finally, if you cling onto something, you hold onto it tightly.

96
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,439
You don't want to let it go.

97
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:03,360
And that's all from us from this program.

98
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,519
We look forward to your company again soon.

99
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,079
In the meantime, find us online on social media and on the BBC Learning English app.

100
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:10,560
Bye!
