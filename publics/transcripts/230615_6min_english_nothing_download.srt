00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Beth.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And I'm Neil. Phew, I've spent a day in meetings, then shopping, then collecting the kids from school.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm exhausted, Beth. What have you been doing today?

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Not much, just sitting around, doing nothing, relaxing and kicking back.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Lucky you, don't you have any work to do?

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It may not look at Neil, but I'm actually as busy as a bee.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
If you've seen nature documentaries about worker bees flying from flower to flower,

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
you probably think animals are always on the move.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But the surprising truth is, away from the cameras, most animals spend most of their time

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
doing absolutely nothing at all.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
In the natural world where finding food and shelter is hard work,

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
why have some animals evolved to do nothing?

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And if it's good enough for animals, would be lazy work for humans too.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's what we'll be discussing in this programme, and as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But first, let me work up the energy to ask you a question, Neil.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Of course, some animals have a reputation for lounging about.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Lions, for example, can sleep up to 20 hours a day.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But what is the slowest moving animal on earth?

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Is it A, the giant tortoise, B, the three-toed sloth, or C, the koala?

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Well, I think it's the three-toed sloth.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Okay, Neil. I'll reveal the correct answer at the end of the programme.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Now, it's no surprise that lazy lions love relaxing,

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
but even animals with reputations for being busy spend time doing nothing.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Look carefully into an ants nest, and you'll see around half of them just sitting there motionless.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Here's Professor Dan Shabinow, an expert in insect behaviour,

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
discussing the lazy rock ant with Emily Knight, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme NatureBang.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Dan's research has focused on ant colonies, a species called Temnor Thorax Regardless, or the rock ant.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I think ants are sort of a symbol of like, industriousness, you know.

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
They have this whole tiny little society going on that's kind of similar to ours.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Some idealised version of what humans might be if we could only like pull it together and all work together,

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
we could be as industrious as the ants, but then when you look at it, you know, roughly about half the colony is inactive at any given time.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We think ants are industrious or hard working.

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Groups of ants called colonies seem tiny, perfect societies where everyone works hard for the good of the group.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Then why are so many of them inactive?

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
One possible answer is that their reserve ants ready to step in if disease or disaster strike.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But could it simply be that they don't work because they don't need to?

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Would you get out of bed on Monday morning if you didn't have to?

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Maybe the ants can teach us a thing or two about relaxing,

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
but wouldn't it get boring just sitting around all day?

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Not according to psychologist Dr Sandy Mann.

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
She thinks being productive, working to produce a lot for the amount of resources we use is overrated.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Boredom has its benefits too, as she explained to BBC Radio 4 programme NatureBang.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Would humans have invented bread or beer or fire, you know, if we hadn't been bored and were wondering what will happen if we mix this with this?

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Are all these sort of inventions the mother of boredom?

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But in this world of constant stimulation, switching off is harder than it's ever been.

48
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's why we're constantly swiping and scrolling and looking for the next big thing and the new thing and we get bored of things very quickly.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000
So it's a kind of paradox to get rid of this unpleasant state of boredom is actually to allow more boredom into your life.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Dr Mann doubts humans would have invented things without the curiosity that comes from being bored.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Boredom is the mother of invention.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:42,000
An idea based on the famous proverb necessity is the mother of invention, an idiom meaning that if you really need to do something, you will think of a way of doing it.

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Instead of fearing boredom, we can open up to its benefits by switching off, stopping worrying or thinking about something and relaxing, slowing down helps too.

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Something we can definitely learn from our animal cousins.

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I think now is a good time to reveal the answer to my question since we have nothing else to do.

56
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You asked me to name the world's slowest animal and I guessed it was the three-toed sloth. Was I right?

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That was the correct answer. With the top speed of 30 centimetres per minute, three-toed sloths move so slowly that algae grows on their coats.

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learnt from this programme starting with the phrase kicking back to stop doing things and relax completely.

59
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The adjective industrious means hardworking.

60
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,000
A colony is the name given to a group of certain animals including ants and some seabirds.

61
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Someone who is productive is able to produce a lot for the amount of resources they use.

62
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The proverb necessity is the mother of invention means that if you really need to do something, you will think of a way of doing it.

63
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And finally, to switch off means to stop worrying or thinking about something and relax.

64
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Once again, our six minutes are up. It must be time to sit down, close your eyes and just do nothing.

65
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Goodbye for now. Bye!
