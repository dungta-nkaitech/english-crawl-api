5
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,120
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Sophie.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,160
And I'm Neil. What did you do at the weekend, Sophie?

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,920
I did a spot of gardening.

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,359
So you're a keen gardener?

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes, I am Neil. And gardening is the subject of today's show.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,960
Now, why don't we start with a quiz question?

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,679
Good idea.

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,320
What percentage of people in the UK said that gardening makes them happier,

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,640
according to a survey conducted by the Royal Horticultural Society?

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,600
Is it a 22% b 52% or c 82%?

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,200
Well, I'll guess.

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,719
B 52%.

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,760
Well, we'll find out later on if you got it right or not.

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,600
So, does gardening make you happy, Neil?

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,320
Well, I tried to grow some tomatoes once,

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,280
and to be honest, it made me rather anxious.

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,759
All the leaves curled up and then dropped off.

22
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,599
Did you get any tomatoes?

23
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:06,400
No.

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,879
So, you don't have green fingers then.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,079
Why are you looking at your fingers, Neil?

26
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:16,079
I wasn't asking whether you literally have green fingers.

27
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,280
Having green fingers means a natural ability for growing plants.

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,039
It's funny you should say gardening makes you anxious,

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,320
because other people find it calming and relaxing.

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,240
Do they? Do you?

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,200
Yes, I do.

32
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,480
Being in the fresh air in all weather's,

33
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,160
communing with nature.

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,040
Sounds very unpleasant.

35
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,160
In all weather's,

36
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,040
means something you do in all types of weather.

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,920
Rain, snow, sunshine,

38
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,680
and communing with nature means feeling close to nature

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,360
and being part of it.

40
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,280
Well, when I tried communing with nature, my hands got all scratched.

41
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,000
I got stung by nasty, creepy crawlies,

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,799
and I even got soil up my nose.

43
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,480
I didn't enjoy it at all.

44
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,200
Try wearing protective clothing next time,

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
and maybe a nose plug too.

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,079
A creepy crawly is a small insect, by the way.

47
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:12,719
So, do you like getting your hands dirty, Sophie?

48
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,319
Yes, I love it.

49
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,280
And it turns out there might be a good reason for this.

50
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,960
Dr. Christopher Lowry,

51
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,040
from the University of Colorado,

52
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,200
conducted an experiment to test whether soil gives us a natural high,

53
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,560
meaning to make us happy without taking drugs.

54
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,319
He injected a bacterium,

55
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,000
commonly found in soil,

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,280
into mice to see what effect this would have on them.

57
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,080
Let's hear what he said in this BBC programme.

58
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,240
Rodents like mice and rats are very good swimmers,

59
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,719
and it was found many years ago that

60
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:46,719
if you treat animals with antidepressant drugs,

61
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,240
and then put the animals in just a beaker of water,

62
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,759
it would cause the animals to swim for longer periods of time.

63
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,639
After injecting the mice with a bacterium,

64
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,280
Dr. Lowry placed them in a cup of water.

65
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,159
These mice that had been injected with a bacterium

66
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,159
swam during a six-minute test for a longer period of time,

67
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,479
then animals that just got a placebo.

68
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,479
So, the bacterium had a similar effect on the mice

69
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,879
as an antidepressant drug might.

70
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,759
When we dig in the soil, we ingest or absorb the bacterium

71
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,479
through our lungs or cuts in our skin.

72
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,400
A placebo, by the way, is a substance with no physical effects

73
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,159
that is used when testing a drug.

74
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,039
So, here, one group of mice were injected with the bacterium,

75
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:35,439
and another group were injected with the placebo.

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,159
And since the mice seemed happier when treated with soil bacteria,

77
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,240
there's a good chance we were too.

78
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,080
Let's move on and hear about how gardening can be therapeutic,

79
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,400
or used to try and treat addiction.

80
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,600
Here's Scott Stevenson, a recovering alcoholic who is learning to garden to help cure him.

81
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,840
So, Scott Stevenson was expelled from school.

82
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,800
He was forced to leave with no qualifications,

83
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,480
but with the help of a support group he now has an NVQ

84
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,800
that's a national vocational qualification here in Britain in gardening.

85
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,079
That's right. At a centre in the UK,

86
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,720
recovering alcoholics have been given the opportunity to plant, grow,

87
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,879
and even sell their produce.

88
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:35,199
These addicts are literally breaking their addiction by breaking the soil.

89
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,800
Nicely phrased, Sophie.

90
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,439
Thank you.

91
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,719
Now, are you ready Neil for the answer to today's quiz question?

92
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:43,680
I am.

93
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,600
I asked, what percentage of people in the UK said that gardening makes them happier,

94
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,000
according to a survey conducted by the Royal Horticultural Society?

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,040
Is it A, 22%, B, 52%, or C, 82%.

96
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,519
I guess B, 52%, I'm wrong, aren't I?

97
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,159
Oh, you are Neil, I'm sorry.

98
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,640
The percentage of people who really enjoy gardening is much higher.

99
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,800
You should have chosen option C.

100
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,480
A survey from the Royal Horticultural Society has shown

101
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,520
that Brits truly are a nation of gardeners,

102
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,440
with 82% saying it makes them feel happier.

103
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,480
The results also revealed that 70% said that given the choice,

104
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,760
they would prefer to spend their working day in the garden

105
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:37,039
with just 9% opting for an office and 21% undecided.

106
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,120
Well, I'm with the 9% I'm afraid.

107
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,240
Now, can we hear the words we learned today, Sophie?

108
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,879
They are green fingers in all weather's,

109
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,279
communing with nature, creepy crawly,

110
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:58,399
natural high, ingest, placebo, therapeutic,

111
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,079
expelled, NVQ.

112
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,239
Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

113
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,199
Now, go back outside, Sophie, get your hands dirty.

114
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,199
Please do join us again soon. Goodbye.

115
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:09,839
Bye-bye.
