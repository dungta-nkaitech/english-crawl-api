From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,640
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,559
I'm Sam.

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,760
And I'm Neil. How are you today, Sam?

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,000
Thanks for asking, Neil. I'm fine.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,160
Not.

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,080
Sorry, so are you fine or not?

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,519
Oh, did I confuse you? My bad.

12
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:32,600
Ah, Sam is speaking English, just a very modern type of English.

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,479
For example, saying, my bad instead of my fault,

14
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:37,759
as a way of accepting that she's wrong.

15
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:40,439
Or adding not at the end of a sentence to show,

16
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:43,560
I really mean the opposite of what I said.

17
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,000
Both are examples of small changes in English,

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,960
which have happened naturally over the last decade or two.

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,439
Changes like these happen, because unlike, say, Latin,

20
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,480
which no one speaks day to day,

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,600
English is a living language.

22
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,120
A language people speak and use in their ordinary lives.

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,560
New bits of English are invented as people use the language in new ways.

24
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,280
But what happens when a language comes from an entirely different galaxy?

25
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,200
Somewhere like Cronos, home planet of the Klingon.

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,159
Yes, when sci-fi TV show Star Trek

27
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,960
introduced alien characters called Klingons,

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,760
the makers needed to invent a whole new language, Klingon.

29
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,480
Entirely made up and unrelated to any human language,

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,240
Klingon has developed a life of its own.

31
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,480
Today, you can even study it at university.

32
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,400
So, Neil, my quiz question is this.

33
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,159
In 2010, Klingon became the first invented language to do what?

34
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,280
Is it A, have its own dictionary?

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,600
B, have an opera written, or C, be recognised as an official language

36
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,520
by the United Nations?

37
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,960
Every language needs vocabulary, so I'll say A, Klingon,

38
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,559
was the first invented language to have its own dictionary.

39
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:01,879
Okay, Neil, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

40
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:05,559
Klingon isn't the only made up language invented for the movies.

41
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,959
David Peterson is the creator of Dothraki,

42
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:11,719
a language used in the fantasy TV show Game of Thrones.

43
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,199
From his home in Los Angeles,

44
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,560
David spoke to Michael Rosen, presenter of BBC Radio 4 programme Word of Mouth.

45
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,519
They discussed St. Hildegard,

46
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,519
who created the very first made up language in the 12th century.

47
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,480
What she had was an entire list of nouns, a whole list of nouns.

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,000
Many of them godly, many of them not.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,439
And she would drop them into songs using Latin grammar,

50
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,680
and other Latin words.

51
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,320
And so, it's not a language proper as the way that we understand it now.

52
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,120
Because really, when we talk about a language,

53
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,320
it's not just the vocabulary, it's the grammar.

54
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,360
Nevertheless, we still kind of look on her

55
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,360
as the patron saint of modern Klingon.

56
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,520
St. Hildegard invented new nouns, but used Latin grammar.

57
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,320
So David doesn't think her invention is a proper language.

58
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,640
Nevertheless, St. Hildegard is considered the patron saint of made up languages.

59
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,840
The patron saint of something refers to a Christian saint

60
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,040
who is believed to give special help to a particular activity.

61
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,920
Here, the activity is inventing a conlang,

62
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,880
short for constructed language,

63
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,800
artificially invented languages like Klingon and Dothraki.

64
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,880
Another famous, constructed language, Esperanto,

65
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:28,280
was invented in 1887 by Polish doctor Ludwig Zamenhof.

66
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,120
He wanted to make it easier for people who spoke different languages

67
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,920
to communicate with each other.

68
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,840
Listen, as David Peterson speaks Esperanto with Michael Rosen

69
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,800
and tests how much he understands for BBC Radio 4 program, Word of Mouth.

70
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,480
You are an English speaker from Western Europe.

71
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,599
And in the 19th century, Universal meant able to be understood

72
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,519
by people from Western Europe.

73
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:57,759
And so, for example, to say I speak Esperanto,

74
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,199
mi parolaise, Esperanto.

75
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,719
Yes, I might have got that one.

76
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,839
The pal bit from its Latin root and me, obviously.

77
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:06,799
Try me again.

78
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,599
Kiel vi fertas.

79
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,919
Who is my father? No.

80
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,560
Where am I traveling?

81
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,839
No, I got stuck on that one.

82
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,360
Like Spanish, Italian and other modern European languages,

83
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,720
Esperanto is based on Latin.

84
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,439
Michael guessed the meaning of the Esperanto word,

85
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,079
parolellas, from its Latin root,

86
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,720
the origin or source of a language.

87
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,920
But the second sentence of Esperanto isn't so easy.

88
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,000
Michael gets stuck on that one.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,360
He can't answer because it's too difficult.

90
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,800
I think I'd probably get stuck on that as well.

91
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,680
But at least, Esperanto was invented for humans,

92
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,959
not alien creatures from outer space.

93
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,959
And speaking of creatures from outer space,

94
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,680
did I get the right answer to your quiz question, Sam?

95
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,719
Ah, so I asked Neil about an unusual first

96
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:55,239
achieved by the made up alien language, Klingon.

97
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:57,599
I guess it was the first invented language

98
00:04:57,599 --> 00:04:59,120
to have its own dictionary.

99
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,879
Which was the wrong answer I'm afraid, Neil.

100
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:04,719
Incredibly, the correct answer was B.

101
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:07,919
In 2010, a company of Dutch musicians and singers

102
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,359
performed the first ever Klingon Opera.

103
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:13,120
The story must have been hard to follow,

104
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,360
but I'm sure the singing was out of this world.

105
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,360
Magica, that's Klingon for great, apparently.

106
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,560
OK, let's recap the vocabulary from our discussion

107
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,759
about invented languages, also called

108
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,519
constructed languages or conlangs for short.

109
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,280
A living language, like English,

110
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,240
is a language that people still speak

111
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,280
and use in their ordinary lives.

112
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,439
The phrase, my bad, originated in the United States,

113
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:39,199
but is also used in Britain as an informal way

114
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,879
to say, my fault.

115
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,680
Or to tell someone that you've made a mistake.

116
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,079
A patron saint is someone believed to give special help

117
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:49,639
and protection to a particular activity.

118
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,879
The root of a language means its origin or source.

119
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,360
And finally, if you get stuck on something,

120
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,519
you're unable to complete it because it's too difficult.

121
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,319
That's all the time we have for this programme

122
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,040
about invented languages.

123
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,040
Gis-Ravido Baldao, that's Esperanto for See You Again Soon.

124
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,839
In other words, Kepler, which is how Klingon say goodbye, I think.

125
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,479
Kepler. Kepler.
