00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,160
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,280
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,480
Plastic pollution is a problem we've discussed before on 6-minute English.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,560
It's an environmental issue which, like the growing amounts of plastic waste, isn't going away.

6
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:29,919
And now micro particles of plastic have even been found, can you guess where, Beth?

7
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:35,920
Let me guess, in our food, inside dead animals at the North Pole.

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,640
At the top of Mount Everest, although the other places you mentioned are true as well.

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,039
Plastic is a tough problem to fix, but fortunately, scientists may now have found a solution.

10
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,799
In this programme, we'll be hearing about chemical recycling,

11
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,559
a groundbreaking way of making old plastic new again.

12
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,879
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

13
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,119
But first, I have a question for you, Beth.

14
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:08,319
Visit the country or seaside and you'll soon see evidence of plastic waste.

15
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:16,400
According to the UN, around 400 million tons of new plastic is produced every year, much of it going to waste.

16
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:21,039
It's hard to imagine what 400 million tons looks like.

17
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,560
So, which of the following, if you placed on a set of scales, would weigh about the same?

18
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:34,000
Is it A, all the people on Earth, B, all the cars on Earth, or C, all the elephants on Earth?

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,680
Hmm, I think all the cars on Earth would weigh about 400 million tons.

20
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,520
Okay, Beth, we'll find out if that's the right answer later.

21
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,880
Globally, less than 10% of all plastic gets recycled.

22
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,920
Some gets incinerated or burnt, and about half of all plastic waste goes straight to landfill,

23
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,159
meaning it's buried underground.

24
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,640
But as a reporter for BBC World Service programme People Fixing the World, William Kramer explained,

25
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,959
this only fixes part of the problem.

26
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:14,159
So, there is a mechanical process where some plastics can be sort of melted down and

27
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:20,960
remolded into a new shape or a new form. But not all plastics can go through that process at all.

28
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,960
And also, it loses a little bit of quality every time you do that, so it will become slightly more

29
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,120
brittle. So, it's actually more downcycling than recycling, but every time it goes through that

30
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,919
process, it gets less useful. Each time plastic is recycled, it gets more brittle, meaning it's

31
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:46,639
easier to break or crack. As a result, what we call recycling is actually downcycling,

32
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:52,560
creating recycled products which are less valuable and of lower quality than the original waste

33
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,039
product. And that's where the new discovery fits in. Chemical recycling uses enzymes,

34
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,159
natural chemicals, which cause changes in other chemicals without being changed themselves.

35
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:11,039
Certain enzymes have evolved the ability to break down plastic into its basic building blocks

36
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:13,439
and use that to make new plastic.

37
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:19,599
The problem is that very few enzymes exist, which can break the chemical bonds in stronger plastics,

38
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,759
like PET, the plastic used in drinks bottles. At least that's what scientists used to think.

39
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:32,079
Until researcher Sintoui Suleiman took a autumn walk in the park near Hela Baratry at the University of

40
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:39,520
Osaka, Japan. In a pile of rotting leaves, she discovered the microorganism leaf branch compost

41
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,000
cutinets, or LCC for short.

42
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:50,160
Sintoui mixed LCC with plastic and left it in her lab overnight. She was surprised to return

43
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:57,520
the next morning and find the plastic gone eaten by the enzyme. The news spread and soon scientists

44
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,760
were predicting a major breakthrough, as William Kramer reported for BBC World Service programme

45
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,040
people fixing the world.

46
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,879
This discovery wasn't the end of the story, but the beginning. LCC showed promise in breaking

47
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,000
down PET plastic, but it needed a lot more work to become stable and effective.

48
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:23,280
The LCC enzyme showed promise in breaking down even strong plastics. If something

49
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,679
shows promise, it has the potential to be successful in the future.

50
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:34,159
Since then, that promise has started to come true. Scientists in France have used LCC to develop

51
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:42,239
new enzymes, and by 2025 they plan to recycle 50,000 tons of plastic waste annually, including

52
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:47,039
strong plastics like PET and nylon, which is used to make clothes.

53
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:54,560
But there's still work to do. 50,000 tons sounds a lot, but not as much as the 400

54
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,520
million tons of plastic waste in your question, Neil. So what was the correct answer?

55
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,680
Right, I asked you what else would weigh about 400 million tons? The amount of new plastic we

56
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,400
produce each year. You guessed all the cars on Earth would weigh the same, which was the wrong

57
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,479
answer I'm afraid, Beth. In fact, it was all the people on Earth.

58
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,679
Okay, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned in this program, starting with

59
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:28,639
incinerate another word for burn. Landfill is a method of dealing with rubbish by burying it in

60
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,839
large holes in the ground. The adjective brittle means easily broken or snapped.

61
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:40,560
Downcycling is recycling, but in such a way that the resulting product is less valuable,

62
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,079
or of lower quality than the original. Enzymes are chemicals found in living cells,

63
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,639
which cause changes in other chemicals to happen while not being changed themselves.

64
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,639
And finally, if something shows promise, it has a lot of potential for success in the future.

65
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:03,360
Once again, our six minutes are up, but remember to join us again next time here at six minutes

66
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,360
English. Goodbye for now. Bye.
