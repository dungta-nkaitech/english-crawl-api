6-Nate English from BBCLearningEnglish.com

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,679
Hello, this is 6-minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,839
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,240
Maybe the only good thing about Covid lockdowns

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,920
was the return of wildlife to our towns and cities.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,600
Birds, foxes and deer were seen in the streets close to people's homes.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,240
Of course, rubbing shoulders with animals,

8
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,119
spending time with them is amazing.

9
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,719
But imagine a hungry African elephant stumbling into your garden

10
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,280
and eating your prize vegetables.

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,839
How would you stop it?

12
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,640
It sounds unlikely,

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,480
but that's exactly the problem faced by farmers in Africa.

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,119
Yes, as human populations increase,

15
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,519
while natural habitats decline,

16
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:55,159
people and animals are increasingly being forced to compete for space.

17
00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:01,239
Wild animals can endanger humans when they break into their farms for food or water.

18
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:07,079
And people might be forced to attack or even kill these animals to defend their homes.

19
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:12,879
This situation, known as human wildlife conflict, is becoming more frequent.

20
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,719
But in this programme, we'll be hearing about ingenious farmers in Kenya

21
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:21,319
who are keeping their food safe from hungry wild animals.

22
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,079
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary.

23
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,079
But first, I have a question for you, Beth.

24
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:34,439
Wailing around six tons of fully grown African elephant needs to eat a lot every day.

25
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,399
But how much exactly?

26
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:40,199
Is it a 50 kilograms of food per day,

27
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:42,879
b 100 kilograms of food per day,

28
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:46,839
or c 150 kilograms of food per day?

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,040
I'll guess an elephant eats 150 kilos of food a day.

30
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,480
Okay, Beth, we'll find out if that's the right answer at the end of the programme.

31
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,879
Victor and Donbi is food security officer for the wildlife charity Save the Elephants.

32
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,359
Victor works at Sarvo National Park in Kenya,

33
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:11,240
where he's often faced with wild elephants breaking into farms for food and water.

34
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,360
Here's Victor explaining more to Michael Koloki,

35
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,440
reporter for BBC World Service programme People Fixing the World.

36
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,120
The conflict usually varies.

37
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,720
What we experience here is during the crop season, the Diderain season,

38
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,840
that's where we usually have the crop rates.

39
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,160
The elephants will come here, lots of them, and the crop rate on the crops.

40
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,240
Can I ask you, where do these elephants come from?

41
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,360
So they come from those private lunches, national parks,

42
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,840
and they come to this community.

43
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,920
They are looking for where there is green pasture.

44
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,239
So they come to this community, where we have these nutritious foods,

45
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,119
you know, elephants, lawnmays, bins, and that is the crop that farmers usually farm.

46
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:56,319
So they come in those crops here and also looking for water.

47
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,719
Victor sounds very calm about this.

48
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,799
It's just a way of life for the people out here.

49
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:05,079
But elephants do spell big trouble for farmers.

50
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:10,359
A fully grown male elephant can weigh the same as six cars on top of each other.

51
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,040
It's easy to see how they can destroy crops and livelihoods.

52
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,520
Victor works in a national park, a large area of land

53
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:25,320
which is protected by the government because of its natural beauty, plants, or animals.

54
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:31,880
He explains that the elephants raid crops like mays and beans from farmers in the park.

55
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,240
To raid means to suddenly attack a place and steal from it.

56
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,920
These crop raids have become more frequent

57
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,759
because elephants are desperate to find water

58
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,799
and because the park lacks money to fix broken fences, which keep wild animals out.

59
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:50,959
Victor says the raids have become a way of life,

60
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,919
an activity that has become a regular thing in people's lives,

61
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:58,079
rather than something that happens only occasionally.

62
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:01,599
That's no problem if it's a fox in your rubbish bin,

63
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,479
but African elephants are as big as six cars on top of each other

64
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:09,399
and this spells trouble for the farmers.

65
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:14,719
If something spells trouble, it suggests that there may be problems in the future.

66
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:19,439
Fortunately, there's an unusual solution that's got people buzzing.

67
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:20,560
Bees.

68
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,920
Ancient Kenyan folklore says that elephants are scared of bees.

69
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,599
That's right. Elephants.

70
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:31,800
The world's biggest land mammal are scared of an insect the size of your thumbnail.

71
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,800
Victor's team install beehive fences to protect farmers crops.

72
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,720
Real bees work best, but even a recording of bees angrily buzzing

73
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,360
is enough to keep the elephants away.

74
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,519
Better yet, the bees also pollinate plants and even produce honey.

75
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:54,680
It's good news for the farmer, but I have to feel a little sorry for the elephants.

76
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,439
Yes, especially because they need to eat so much.

77
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:01,800
I think it's time to reveal the answer to my question, Beth.

78
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,519
You asked me how much food an elephant eats per day

79
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,160
and I guess it was 150 kilograms.

80
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,480
And that was the correct answer, well done.

81
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,879
A fully grown African elephant needs 150 kilograms of food per day.

82
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,879
Okay, let's recap the rest of the vocabulary we've learned in this program

83
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:23,360
about human wildlife conflict,

84
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,079
a phrase describing harmful encounters between humans and wild animals.

85
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,359
If you rub shoulders with someone, you meet them and spend time together.

86
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:36,479
To raid means to suddenly attack a place and steal something.

87
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,719
A national park is a large area of a country

88
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:44,759
which is protected by the government because of its natural beauty, plants or animals.

89
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,959
If you describe an activity as a way of life,

90
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:51,599
you mean that it's become a common or regular event for someone

91
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:54,680
rather than something that happens only occasionally.

92
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,840
And finally, when something spells trouble,

93
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,000
it suggests that there may be problems coming in the future.

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,199
Once again, our six minutes are up.

95
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,120
Goodbye for now.

96
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
Bye.
