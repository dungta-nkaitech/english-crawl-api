5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,960
Hello and welcome to 6MuteEnglish. I'm Alice.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,879
And I'm Rob. Now, Alice, how old are you?

7
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,839
I'm 21 Rob, not a day older.

8
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,320
Come on, don't be coy about your age, Alice.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,160
Cooy, by the way, means not wanting to give away information about yourself.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,679
I'm not being coy, Rob. I just don't feel like telling everyone how old I am.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,039
Some people think it's rude to ask.

12
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,560
I don't mean to be rude, of course, but, well, you are being coy.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:47,120
I'm asking because today we're talking about age and whether you can be too old for some things.

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,079
What do you think?

15
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,560
I'm too old to order of children's menus in restaurants, but I still do it.

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,600
Anything else?

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,400
Well, I couldn't pull an all-nighter anymore.

18
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:58,320
Okay, that's another way of saying,

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,079
stay up all night to finish something.

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,719
That's what students do to get their work done.

21
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,679
I used to be able to do it, and now I couldn't.

22
00:01:05,679 --> 00:01:08,640
I struggled to stay up on New Year's Eve until midnight.

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,359
But let's move on to today's quiz question.

24
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:16,159
What percentage of people aged over 65 surveyed in the UK

25
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,560
described themselves as old?

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:26,079
Is it a 6% B 16% or C 60%?

27
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,439
Well, I think it's just a 6%.

28
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,439
People don't like to think of themselves as old.

29
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,280
Well, we'll find out if you got the answer right or wrong later in the show.

30
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,439
First, let's explore the subject of aging more.

31
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,519
Tell me, Rob, do you think you can be too old to take up a new hobby?

32
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,719
Oh, I might be. I mean, it depends on the hobby, of course.

33
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:49,439
I went for a run the other day, and it nearly killed me.

34
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,759
Oh, that just means you're unfit, Rob.

35
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,960
Ah.

36
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,320
Let's listen to Ernestine Shepherd, who didn't think she was too old

37
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,719
to take up an interesting new hobby.

38
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,719
At the age of 71, she started bodybuilding,

39
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,520
and is currently listed in the Guinness Book of Records

40
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,400
as the oldest female bodybuilder in the world.

41
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:17,200
If ever there were an anti-aging pill, I would call it exercise.

42
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,040
I enjoy working out with the people who come to the church.

43
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,479
Sometimes they say, oh, this hurts.

44
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,519
But I tell people, age is nothing but a number.

45
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:32,959
I am 75 years of age.

46
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,280
This morning, I awakened at 2.30.

47
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,359
I have a group of four other people who run with me in the mornings.

48
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:46,239
We run about 10 miles every day.

49
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,479
Wow, that was Ernestine Shepherd.

50
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,159
What an example to a soul.

51
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:55,759
Work out, by the way, means taking exercise to make yourself fit.

52
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,519
I think it's true that if we did more exercise every day,

53
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,000
we would all look and feel much better.

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,039
Ernestine is all for exercise, but I'm afraid I take some anti-aging pill,

55
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,159
if one existed.

56
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,280
If something is advertised as being anti-aging,

57
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,319
it means it's designed to stop you looking older.

58
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,719
And you can find hundreds of products these days

59
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:19,519
that claim to have anti-aging properties.

60
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,719
Lots of lotions and potions for women in particular.

61
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,880
Yes, that's because women feel pressurised to look younger than their age.

62
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,840
It's an example of ageism and it isn't fair.

63
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,920
Ageism means discrimination against people because of their age.

64
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,200
And sometimes people can be discriminated against in the workplace for being too old.

65
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,480
Now, do you think you could be too old to take up a new job, Alice?

66
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,680
No, I don't get the concept of too old at all.

67
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,840
My grandparents both still work,

68
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,039
and they have more enthusiasm and energy than I do.

69
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,120
They hate being called senior citizens and old age pensioners

70
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,640
or by the initials of these words, O-A-P.

71
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,680
And they're right.

72
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,080
Who wants to be defined by their age?

73
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,800
You just said don't get this concept

74
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,520
and to get something means to understand it.

75
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,680
So I suppose you stay the same inside.

76
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,920
It's just the outside that changes.

77
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,920
We have to be young at heart at least.

78
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,280
And age is no reason for some people to stop working

79
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,119
if they're in good health.

80
00:04:19,119 --> 00:04:20,799
Let's listen to Trisha Custon,

81
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,359
who started a new business at 65,

82
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:26,399
supplying beauty products for older women.

83
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,439
Her age actually inspired her choice of work.

84
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,639
I had an idea.

85
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,039
I've seen a problem and an opportunity.

86
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:38,079
And I've done something about it and created a business

87
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,719
which I'm very happy to say is very successful.

88
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:41,599
I mean, I started it.

89
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,119
It was going to be a hobby.

90
00:04:43,119 --> 00:04:44,959
You know, something to keep me out of trouble.

91
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:46,079
Give me something to do.

92
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,319
Trisha Custon there.

93
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,039
She started a new hobby and it turned

94
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:53,359
into a successful business enterprise.

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,279
Now, before we finish,

96
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,240
I'd just like to put the case for older men.

97
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,919
My dad, my granddad, Sean Connery, Michael Cain,

98
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,479
Harrison Ford, they're all fantastic role models

99
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,680
for us younger guys.

100
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,560
Mmm, and a role model is somebody people admire and want copy.

101
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,240
Well, that brings us round to the matter

102
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,240
of today's quiz question, Alice.

103
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,280
Yes, it does.

104
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,439
I asked, what percentage of people aged over 65 surveyed

105
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,360
in the UK described themselves as old in a survey?

106
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,639
Is it a 6% b 16% or c 60%?

107
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,840
Yep, and I said a 6% was I right?

108
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,360
Yes, you were.

109
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,319
You were right.

110
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,600
Well done.

111
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,600
More than 2,000 people aged between 65 and 93

112
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,480
were surveyed by UK market research firm UGov.

113
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,000
Now, here are the words we learnt today, Rob.

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,040
They were,

115
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,160
coy, pull and all-nighter,

116
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,040
workout, anti-aging,

117
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,080
ageism,

118
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,920
senior citizen,

119
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,680
old age pensioner,

120
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,360
or OAP.

121
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,000
Get something role model.

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,640
Well, that's the end of today's 6 Minute English.

123
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,400
Don't forget to join us again soon.

124
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,760
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
