From BBC Learning English.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,679
Hello, this is 6 Minute English, I'm Georgina.

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:16,879
And I'm Rob.

7
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:18,879
What do you do when you're tired, Rob?

8
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,600
Oh, well, I go to bed.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,120
Before that.

10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,359
I clean my teeth.

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,320
But what does your body do to tell you you're tired?

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,399
Right, well, these days I just kind of fall asleep in front of the TV.

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,560
Yes, but okay, what am I doing now?

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,960
Oh, yes, hang on, yes, you sit me off.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,159
Yawning.

16
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,920
Yes, yawning is a sign that we're tired or bored.

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,240
Are you tired or bored now?

18
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,920
No, not particularly.

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,439
So why did you just yawn?

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, because you did.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,960
That's the thing about yorns, they are contagious.

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,520
They can spread from one person to another.

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,240
And that's what we're looking at in this program.

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,239
But first, today's question.

25
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,200
What biological function does yawning have?

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Essentially, why do we yawn?

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,920
Is it A to take in more oxygen?

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,120
B to get rid of carbon dioxide from our body?

29
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,040
C no one really knows.

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,159
What do you think, Rob?

31
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:19,200
Oh, I know this.

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,520
We yawn to take in more oxygen.

33
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,280
I'm pretty sure that's it.

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,920
Okay, we'll see if you're correct at the end of the program.

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,320
John Dury is a researcher from Sussex University.

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,519
On the BBC Radio 4 series All in the Mind,

37
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,040
he spoke about yawning and why it is contagious.

38
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,960
Which animal, does he mention, will also capture yawn from its owner?

39
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,640
Yawning is actually a difficult case when it comes to these contagious behaviours.

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,560
It is the most contagious behaviour.

41
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,840
And it's meant to be automatic.

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,920
It's something that you can't stop.

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,240
Dogs yawn when they're own is yawn.

44
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:55,920
Animals yawn to each other.

45
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,479
It happens whether you want to or not.

46
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,280
These kinds of effects have been found for other kinds of behaviour.

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,719
So really, we were trying to push it as far as we could

48
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,120
and see if there's a cognitive element to this implement behaviour.

49
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,199
Which animal might yawn when its owner does?

50
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,079
Dogs.

51
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:16,639
Dogs can catch a yawn from their owners.

52
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,599
Yes, yawning is a very contagious behaviour.

53
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,400
The use of the word behaviour here is interesting.

54
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,719
Normally it is an accountable noun to describe the way we act,

55
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,200
either in a good or a bad way.

56
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,560
We talk about, for example, dogs or children's behaviour being good or bad.

57
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,360
But it's also used as an uncountable noun when we're talking about a particular action

58
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,360
that, for example, an animal makes in particular situations.

59
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,879
These behaviours are often not conscious but are an automatic response to a situation.

60
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,479
And the researchers were looking to see if there was a cognitive side to the behaviour,

61
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,199
which means they were looking at the mental process.

62
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,079
What is happening in the mind to make us yawn?

63
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,240
Particularly when someone else yawns.

64
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,199
Let's listen again.

65
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,800
Yawning is actually a difficult case when it comes to these contagious behaviours.

66
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,719
It is the most contagious behaviour.

67
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:11,919
It is meant to be automatic.

68
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,079
It's something that you can't stop.

69
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:16,319
Dogs yawn when their owner is yawn.

70
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,680
Animals yawn to each other.

71
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,560
It happens whether you want to or not.

72
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,360
These kind of effects have been found for other kinds of behaviours.

73
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,879
So really we were trying to push it as far as we could

74
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,280
and see if there's a cognitive element to this implement behaviour.

75
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,719
The research discovered that contagious yawning is connected with our social group

76
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,960
and how close we feel to the people in it.

77
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,960
Here's John Dury again.

78
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,040
So the more that you identify with the in-group target,

79
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,079
the more likely you are to copy their behaviour.

80
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:52,079
What we do when we see a behaviour is at some level we're making a judgment

81
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,959
about whether the person exhibiting that behaviour,

82
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,359
whether it's an emotion or a scratching behaviour or anything,

83
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:00,159
is relevant.

84
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,159
Just their behaviour indicate to us how we should behave.

85
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,560
So essentially yawning is more contagious if we identify with the person who yawns first.

86
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,959
If we feel close to and belong in,

87
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,079
the same group as a person who exhibits the behaviour,

88
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,680
the person who does the yawning, we are likely to yawn too.

89
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,600
So you're less likely to yawn if a stranger yawns

90
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,960
than if someone in your close family or circle of friends yawns.

91
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,480
Let's listen again.

92
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,000
So the more that you identify with the in-group target,

93
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,600
the more likely you are to copy their behaviour.

94
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,600
What we do when we see a behaviour is at some level we're making a judgment

95
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,480
about whether the person exhibiting that behaviour,

96
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:46,879
whether it's an emotion or a scratching behaviour or anything,

97
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,680
is relevant.

98
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,680
Just their behaviour indicate to us how we should behave.

99
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,280
Right, before we review the vocabulary,

100
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,879
let's have the answer to our quiz.

101
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,720
Why do we yawn?

102
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,439
Is it A to take in more oxygen,

103
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,640
B to get rid of carbon dioxide from our body,

104
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,960
or C no one really knows?

105
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,400
Rob, what did you say?

106
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,079
Well, I was pretty sure it was A to take in more oxygen.

107
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,439
There is in fact no clear biological reason for yawning

108
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,159
that is agreed upon, so no one really knows.

109
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,039
We've been talking about yawning,

110
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,000
the action of opening our mouths wide open

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,359
and stretching our ear drums when tired or bored.

112
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:29,839
Yawning can also be contagious,

113
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:32,560
this means it can pass from one person to another.

114
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,000
And a yawn can be described as a behaviour,

115
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,879
a particular kind of automatic action in response

116
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,879
to a particular situation.

117
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,560
The word cognitive is related to our mental processes,

118
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,480
the way our minds work.

119
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,439
If you identify with a particular group,

120
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,879
you feel close to that group and feel you belong in that group.

121
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,279
And finally, to exhibit a behaviour,

122
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,600
is to actually do that particular behaviour.

123
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,920
And before we all start yawning, it's time for us to go.

124
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,519
Do join us again soon and you can always find us online

125
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,879
on social media and on the BBC Learning English app.

126
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:09,839
Bye for now.

127
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:10,479
Bye bye.
