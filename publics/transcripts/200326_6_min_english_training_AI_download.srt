From BBC Learning English

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,519
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:18,480
And I'm Sam.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,480
Do you like cooking, Sam?

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,719
There's a new recipe I've been trying out. It's for frosted oysters.

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,719
Frosted oysters.

10
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:29,919
Sounds unusual? How do you make it?

11
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:35,119
Well, you take a pound of chicken, then some cubed pork and half crushed garlic.

12
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,719
A. I thought you said it was for frosted oysters.

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,600
Whatever they are.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,640
Yes, that's right.

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,759
Now heated up until boiling and serve with custard.

16
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:45,599
Ah, sounds disgusting.

17
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:47,519
Who on earth told you that recipe?

18
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:50,719
It's not who told me, Sam, but what?

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,159
In fact, that recipe was made by computers using artificial intelligence or AI,

20
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:58,559
which is the topic of today's programme.

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:05,039
In real life, AI is making huge progress from car satnavs to detecting cancer cells.

22
00:01:05,039 --> 00:01:10,239
But as you can see from that revolting recipe, things don't always go according to plan.

23
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,400
So just how intelligent is artificial intelligence?

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,599
I mean, it definitely needs some cooking lessons.

25
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,439
Right. AI is not as intelligent as we tend to think.

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,359
AI programmes use artificial brain cells to roughly imitate real brain cell activities,

27
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,519
but they're still a long way behind human levels of intelligence.

28
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,879
And that's my quiz question.

29
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,959
In terms of brain cell count, what level of intelligence is AI currently working at?

30
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:45,039
Is AI as smart as A a frog, B an earthworm or C a bumblebee?

31
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,599
Well, I don't think any of those are good cooks either, to be honest,

32
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,919
but I'll say C a bumblebee because at least they can make honey.

33
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:56,319
Nice guess, Sam. We'll find out the answer later.

34
00:01:56,319 --> 00:02:02,239
But first, let's find out more about how AI misunderstandings, like the oyster recipe, can happen.

35
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,719
Janelle Shane is the author of You Look Like A Thing and I Love You,

36
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,280
in which she tells her amusing experiences and bizarre experiments with AI.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,400
You look like a thing and I love you.

38
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,120
That's a strange title for a book, Neil.

39
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,560
Yes, it's another example of AI miscommunication.

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,520
The book title is what AI produced when asked to write chat-up lines.

41
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,759
Remarks, men and women make to start up a conversation with someone they don't know,

42
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,280
but find attractive.

43
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,040
Here she is talking to the BBC World Service Program more or less.

44
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,400
So machine learning is what most programmers mean when they say AI.

45
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,640
In the programs that we're used to, if you want to have a computer program,

46
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,800
solve a problem, you have to have a human programmer write down exhaustive step-by-step

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,560
instructions on how to do everything.

48
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,840
But with machine learning, you just give it the goal and then the program figures out

49
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,040
via trial and error how it's going to solve that problem.

50
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,200
So even though we're talking about machines learning for themselves,

51
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,640
there still need to be humans involved at the start of the journey.

52
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:15,439
This human teaching is done by computer programmers,

53
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:20,239
people who write or code, the computer programs used by AI.

54
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,879
Right, these programmers write algorithms,

55
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,119
a set of rules or procedures to be followed in problem-solving exercises.

56
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,679
So for example, the AI that wrote that oyster recipe read thousands of other recipes before

57
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:35,359
coming up with its own version.

58
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:40,560
In other words, our official intelligence uses a process of trial and error.

59
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,919
Repeating the same task over and over until finding the most successful way.

60
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,879
Only in the case of the oyster recipe, there was more error than trial.

61
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,479
Well, according to Janelle Shane, we can learn a lot about something by seeing how it goes wrong.

62
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,959
Here she is talking about an AI which have been told to solve maths problems.

63
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,359
It seemed to be that it was getting scored on how many wrong answers that it got.

64
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,400
And it was supposed to be minimizing the number of wrong answers.

65
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,920
And just by a stroke of luck, as part of its trial and error flailing around,

66
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,360
one of the flails it did accidentally deleted the solutions list.

67
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,160
And then it and everybody else got a perfect score.

68
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:30,400
So, AI is learned by minimizing their errors, reducing them as much as possible.

69
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,720
And sometimes these algorithms only discover the right answer by a stroke of luck.

70
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,199
When something unexpected happens by good luck or chance.

71
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,560
It seems to me that they're not so intelligent after all.

72
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,480
Well, let's settle it once and for all by answering today's quiz question.

73
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:53,199
Remember I asked you how intelligent AI was in terms of brain cell count.

74
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,360
And you said as intelligent as...

75
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,600
I said see a bumblebee.

76
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,759
Well, here's Janelle again with the answer.

77
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,520
If you're looking at rough computing power,

78
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,719
the algorithms we're working with are probably somewhere around the level of an earthworm?

79
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:13,359
Ah, so the correct answer was B as clever as an earthworm.

80
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:15,439
No wonder AI's can't cook.

81
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,519
Or take a maths test without cheating.

82
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,680
In this program, we've been looking at artificial intelligence or AI.

83
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,479
And seeing how programmers, that's people who write instructions for computers to follow,

84
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,079
create algorithms, sets of rules used in problem solving.

85
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,199
AI learns through trial and error,

86
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,159
repeating the same activity again and again until discovering the best way

87
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:44,560
and minimizing, so reducing as much as possible, the number of errors it makes.

88
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,560
And success can be the result of a stroke of luck when something unexpected happens purely by chance.

89
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,639
Although so far that hasn't helped AI's to write good chat-up lines.

90
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,399
The flattering remarks people make to get to know someone they find attractive.

91
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,079
And AI's don't know much about cooking oysters either.

92
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:03,839
That's all from us from this program.

93

95
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:11,599
Bye-bye.
