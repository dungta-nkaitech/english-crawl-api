2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Neil.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And I'm Beth. Smell a vision, a television which allows you to smell things as well as see them,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and a miracle pill which cures all diseases. These predictions for the future were made in the 1930s,

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but so far they haven't come true.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Making predictions for the future isn't easy. Just ask TechBillionaire Elon Musk,

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
who recently predicted that artificial intelligence will eventually mean that no one will have to work.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In fact, there have been many predictions about the future of work.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
For example, that robots will take over most jobs, and that everyone will work from home.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
One of these predictions came true. Millions were forced to work from home.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So what will work be like in the future?

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's what we'll be discussing in this programme, and as usual we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary too.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But first I have a question for you, Beth.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Another idea for the future is the four-day working week,

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
where employees work four days for the same money as five.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
After Covid, many British companies gave the idea a go,

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
but out of the 60 companies taking parts in a four-day working week trial in 2023,

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
how many said they planned to continue with a shorter work week?

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Was it A, 52% B, 72% or C, 92%.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hmm, I guess 52% of the companies planned to continue with a four-day week.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay, Beth, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Now, whatever Elon Musk thinks, as we've seen it's difficult to make your predictions accurate,

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
here's Sean Lay, presenter of BBC World Service programme, The Real Story,

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
asking University of Cambridge Professor Brendan Bertchell,

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
what he thinks about predictions for the future of work.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Brendan Bertchell, when you look at all the predictions that have been made,

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Selene, you're working lifetime.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Do you kind of take some of the things that have been predicted now with a large pinch of salt?

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I do, I think we have to be skeptical.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I think the track record for economists and other social scientists isn't good.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
When we look, you know, for hundreds of years, a hundred years now,

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
people have been predicting that there will be really quite dramatic reductions in working time

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
like Elon Musk has just made.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And previously, those predictions, although we're heading very gradually in that direction,

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
those predictions of very, very large changes in working time just haven't come to pass.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Sean asks if we should take predictions with a pinch of salt.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
To take something with a pinch of salt is an idiom, meaning to doubt

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
that what you've been told is accurate or likely to come true.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
For example, if your friend always lies, you take what they say with a pinch of salt.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Professor Birchall thinks predictions for the future of work have a bad track record.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
A track record means all the achievements or failures that someone has had in the past.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
When it comes to predicting the future of work, most predictions simply haven't come to pass,

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
an old fashioned way of saying happened will come true.

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So are predictions for a future of leisure relaxing by the pool while robots do all the work

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
just a dream.

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Let's hear from Andrew Palmer, business editor for the Economist magazine,

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
talking to BBC World Service Program, The Real Story.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm not a tech dystopian.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't think that machines or AI are going to get rid of all jobs.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But I do worry about a sequencing risk.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So there will be some disruption from AI, some jobs, some professions are at risk.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And although economists like to say new jobs will crop up,

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
they won't necessarily be aligned at the same time.

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
They won't be coordination.

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Andrew is not a dystopian.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Someone who imagines a nightmare future of suffering and injustice.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He doesn't think AI will get rid of all jobs.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
To get rid of something means to remove it because you no longer want it.

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Andrew predicts that AI will replace some jobs,

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and those workers will need support.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But he also thinks new jobs will crop up.

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
They will appear unexpectedly.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And that's exactly the problem.

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The future is hard to predict because it's so unexpected.

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Anyway, I reckon a shorter working week is something we can all agree on right now?

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Absolutely.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I think it's time to reveal the answer to my question

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
about the 60 companies trying out a shorter working week in 2023.

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I asked how many of them plan to continue a four-day week at the end of the trials.

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And I guessed 52% so was I right?

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That was the wrong answer I'm afraid, bet.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Actually, a whopping 92% of the companies plan on keeping a four-day week

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
because it was so popular with bosses as well as workers.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Right, let's recap the vocabulary we've learned from this program

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
starting with the idiom, take it with a pinch of salt,

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
meaning don't completely believe what you are told is true.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
A track record means the achievements or failures of someone's past performance.

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Come to pass is an old-fashioned way of saying take place or happen?

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
A dystopian is someone who foresees a nightmarish future

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
where there's great suffering and injustice in society.

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If you get rid of something, you remove something that you no longer want.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And finally, if something crops up, it appears or happens unexpectedly.

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000

Goodbye.
