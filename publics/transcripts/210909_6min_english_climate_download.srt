8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,760
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I'm Neil.

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,760
And I'm Sam.

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,760
No one is too small to make a difference. Do you know who said that, Sam?

11
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,760
Wasn't it climate change after this, guess a chin book?

12
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:59,679
That's right, she went on to say this in her message to world leaders. I don't want you

13
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:05,759
to be hopeful. I want you to act as if your house is on fire because it is.

14
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:10,640
Her speech reflected the feelings of many young people around the world who think that

15
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,560
not enough action is being taken on climate change.

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,920
And they might be right, judging by the record breaking temperatures that hit Canada and

17
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,840
the northwest of the United States in July this year.

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,120
Gressertumberg's plea to act like your house is on fire became a reality for residents

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,680
of the small town of Lyson, Canada, which burned to the ground in a shocking world fire,

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,200
a fire that is burning strongly in out of control.

21
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,159
So once the litun wildfire yet another climate change wake up call. A wake up call is the

22
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,000
expression used to describe a shocking event that should make people realise that action

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
is needed to change something.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,920
And they may not, according to some climatologists who worryingly say that what happened in Lyson

25
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,159
should not even have been possible. So in this programme we'll be asking if scientists

26
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:05,760
have dangerously misunderstood the realities of climate change.

27
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,120
But first it's time for my quiz question and it's about that extreme weather in Canada.

28
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,199
It broke records when the temperature in Litton hit an all time high on the first of July,

29
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:28,039
so just how hot did it get? Was it A 39.6 degrees, B 49.6 degrees or C 59.6 degrees Celsius?

30
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:35,239
All those temperatures look really high, especially for snowy Canada. I'll say A 39.6 degrees

31
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,239
C.

32
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,560
Okay Sam, we'll find out at the answer later on. Seeing your hometown burn to the ground

33
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,400
was bad enough, but perhaps even worse was the fact that the wildfires were so unexpected.

34
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,000
According to weather pass in modelling done by a team of Oxford University researchers,

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,560
such extreme heat was impossible in theory at least.

36
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,280
The research team was led by a climatologist Gert Jern van Olderberg. Here he is in conversation

37
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,240
with BBC World Service Programme Science in Action.

38
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,360
This is a wake up call beyond the wake up calls that we've had before.

39
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:19,159
Yes, it's a very big shock in the sense that we thought we knew that how heat waves react

40
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:23,960
to global warming and within which boundaries they are increasing. Of course they're increasing

41
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:29,719
in temperature, but it's a gradual process we thought. And then you get this thing and

42
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:33,600
it's not gradual at all. It's a huge jump.

43
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,239
Professor Van Oldenberg had been studying the impact of global warming on heat waves,

44
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,879
short periods of time when there were there is much hotter than usual.

45
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,240
Along with other climatologists he thought that climate change was gradual, changing or

46
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,840
happening slowly over a long period of time.

47
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,479
But the Canadian heat waves caused him to think again. Instead of being gradual the temperatures

48
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:04,120
saw a jump or a sudden increase of five degrees. And it's the sudden jump that's got

49
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,879
Professor Van Oldenberg and his team worried.

50
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,519
By collecting data from all over the world climatologists tried to predict changes in

51
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,759
the pattern of global warming.

52
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:20,519
But as Gert Jern van Oldenberg told BBC World Services Science in Action, the heat wave

53
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,519
inlisten didn't fit these predictions at all.

54
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:31,839
Everything looked like a nice regular, gradual trend like we were used to up to last year.

55
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,279
And then you suddenly break all your records by four or five degrees. I mean this is something

56
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:41,000
that's not supposed to happen. And it has really shaken our confidence in how well we understand

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,479
the effect of climate change on heat waves.

58
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,919
Despite all his research, Professor Van Oldenberg is still unable to explain such extreme

59
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,159
and sudden changes in the climate. And this he says has shaken his confidence, made

60
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,600
him doubt something that he was certain was true.

61
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,120
And it's this lack of understanding, worrying researchers because as the story of the town

62
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:10,680
of Litten shows, the effects of climate change may be even worse than expected.

63
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,440
Maybe it's time we all took notice of Gert Jern van Oldenberg's wake up call to take

64
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:21,200
action on climate change. Especially if even cold northern countries like Canada or Britain

65
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:27,240
for that matter can experience such extreme changes. Speaking of which Neil, what was the

66
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,240
answer to your quiz question?

67
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,560
Ah yes, in my quiz question I asked you exactly how high the temperature reached in the Canadian

68
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,319
town of Litten. What did you say Sam?

69
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:43,000
I thought it was a 39.6 degrees Celsius was I right.

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,919
Well you were close but in fact it got even hotter actually reaching 49.6 degrees Celsius.

71
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,640
The highest temperature ever recorded in Canada by at least 5 degrees.

72
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:00,840
Phew, that is hot. Well we'd better recap the vocabulary from this programme because we

73
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,640
might be hearing these words a lot more in the future.

74
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:10,240
Let's start with a wildfire which is an out of control fire that is burning the countryside.

75
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,360
A wake up call is an event which should make people realise that action needs to be taken

76
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,240
to change a situation.

77
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,720
A heat wave is a period of days or weeks when the weather is much hotter than usual.

78
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,439
A jump is a sudden increase.

79
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,560
Whereas gradual means happening slowly over a long time.

80
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,879
And finally if something shakes your confidence it makes you doubt something that you thought

81
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:34,879
was true.

82
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,280
That's it for our look at one of the hottest years on record.

83
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,280
Bye for now.

84
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,280
Bye.
