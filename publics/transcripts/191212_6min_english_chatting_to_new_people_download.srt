00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,439
Hello, this is 6 Minute English and I'm Neil.

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:17,839
Joining me for our discussion is Georgina.

7
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:18,640
Hello.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,640
Now Georgina, you're a chatty, social kind of person, aren't you?

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,480
Well, yes, I think so.

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,640
But would you go up to a stranger and strike up a conversation?

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,320
That might be going too far.

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,120
If you don't know them, what are you going to start talking about?

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,399
A good question.

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,039
But maybe you should, because in this programme,

15
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,880
we're looking at how talking to strangers might actually be good for you.

16
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,079
But first, let me talk to you about today's question.

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,519
I'd like you to answer this.

18
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,040
To make conversation, we need words.

19
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,920
So according to the Oxford English Dictionary,

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,240
approximately how many words are in use in the English language.

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,560
Is it A, 171,146?

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,280
B, 271,146?

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,719
Or C, 371,146?

24
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:16,079
We use a lot of words in English, but not 371,000.

25
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:22,079
So I'll go for A, 171,146.

26
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,159
Okay, well, as always, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme.

27
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,319
Now let's continue our conversation about having conversations with strangers.

28
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:34,719
Many of us spend part of every day surrounded by strangers,

29
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,399
whether on our commute to work, sitting in a park or cafe,

30
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:39,920
or visiting the supermarket.

31
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,239
But we rarely reach out and talk to them because we fear it would make us both feel uncomfortable or awkward.

32
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:51,280
And Gillian Sandstrom, social psychologist from Essex University in the UK,

33
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,959
can't explain why.

34
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:57,119
Here she is speaking on BBC Radio 4s all in the Minds programme.

35
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,280
We kind of underestimate, we have this negative voice in our head

36
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,199
that's telling us, oh, I shouldn't have said that.

37
00:02:03,199 --> 00:02:04,559
Why did I do that?

38
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:06,399
I said that story better last time.

39
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,359
But the other person doesn't know any of that.

40
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:14,479
And they're probably, they might be anticipating that they won't have a positive conversation.

41
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,680
And then they do.

42
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,479
And they think, wow, that person was amazing.

43
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:22,560
So we walk around with this fear that the other person isn't going to be interested in

44
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,360
talking to us.

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,159
Fascinating stuff.

46
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:31,680
So we have a negative voice in our head telling us about all the bad things that might happen.

47
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,240
We basically underestimate ourselves.

48
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,759
To underestimate means to think that something is smaller or less important than it really is.

49
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,439
We worry that what we say won't be interesting or important enough.

50
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,879
But the other person doesn't know that.

51
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,400
They're also anticipating or guessing the outcome.

52
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,240
They're thinking that if they have a conversation, it won't go well.

53
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,560
But of course, when strangers do talk to each other, it normally goes well.

54
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,280
Yes, it's just fear that is stopping us.

55
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,240
But if we get over that fear and get chatting, people might actually like us.

56
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,680
We might make new friends.

57
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,920
Another reason why you should pluck up the courage to talk to strangers

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,000
is that it is good for our health.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,200
Plug up the courage.

60
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,960
That's a good phrase, Georgina, meaning force yourself to do something

61
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,320
that you're scared about.

62
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,520
And, research by the University of Chicago,

63
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,319
found we may often underestimate the positive impact of connecting with others

64
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,120
for both our own and others well-being.

65
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,000
And connecting here means starting or having a good relationship with someone.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,480
So the research found that, for example,

67
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,760
having a conversation with a stranger on your way to work

68
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,879
may leave you both feeling happier than you would think.

69
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,840
Julian Sandstrom also spoke about her research

70
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,599
and the power of talking to strangers on the UNIORS program.

71
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,360
Listen out for the word connected.

72
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,439
What we've shown in the research is that it's really good for your mood.

73
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,879
So people are in a better mood after they reach out and have a conversation,

74
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,080
however minimal.

75
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,280
And the other thing that the research has shown is it just makes people feel more

76
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,319
connected to each other.

77
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:07,920
There you go.

78
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,319
Talking to strangers is good for our mood.

79
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,480
And mood means the way we feel.

80
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,040
It's good for our mental health and we might discover people actually like us.

81
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,680
And even if we're an introvert, a person who prefers to be alone rather than with others,

82
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,760
experiments have shown that talking to others can make us happier.

83
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,280
The problem remains now that when speaking to someone new,

84
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,800
what do you talk about?

85
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,800
How about some interesting facts?

86
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,480
Like approximately how many words are in use in the English language?

87
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,400
Which is what I asked you earlier.

88
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,080
Is it a 171 146?

89
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,800
B 271 146?

90
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:52,000
Or C 371 146?

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,519
What did you say, Georgina?

92
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:57,839
I said 171 146.

93
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,879
Was I right?

94
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,319
Spot on Georgina.

95
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,120
Well done.

96
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,719
Yes, there's an estimated 171 146 words currently in use in the English language,

97
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,280
according to the Oxford English dictionary,

98
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,680
plus many more obsolete words.

99
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,320
I shall pick a few of them and make conversation with someone on the tube later.

100
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,320
But not before we recap some of the vocabulary we've explained.

101
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,760
Yes, so we highlighted six words starting with underestimate,

102
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,160
which is to think that something is smaller or less important than it really is.

103
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,320
Anticipating means guessing or expecting a certain outcome.

104
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,120
I anticipate this programme to be six minutes long.

105
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,840
That's a given.

106
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,439
Next, we mentioned the phrase to pluck up the courage,

107
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,679
meaning to force yourself to do something that you're scared or nervous about.

108
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:50,479
When you connect with someone, it means you start or have a good relationship with someone.

109
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,560
I think we've connected on this programme, Neil.

110
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,759
Absolutely, Georgina.

111
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,479
And that's put me in a good mood.

112
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,399
Mood means the way we feel.

113
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,959
And finally, an introvert is a person who prefers to spend time on their own.

114
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,000
Thanks, Georgina.

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,279
Well, that's our conversation over that you can hear more from us on our website and on our app.

116
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,000
Goodbye.

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,720
Bye.
