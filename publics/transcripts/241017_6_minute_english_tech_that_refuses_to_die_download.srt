2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Phil.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And I'm Georgie.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The exciting thing about technology is that it's always changing.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Can you remember when computer floppy disks, handheld gameboys and fax machines were in fashion?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Do you still have a Walkman Casseplair from the 1980s?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Today, technology progresses so quickly that old tech soon becomes obsolete.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
No longer in use, having been replaced by something better or more fashionable.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So, you might be surprised to hear that until recently the government of Japan

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
still used 3.5 inch floppy disks to store official documents.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That around the world, music cassettes and Walkmans are making a comeback.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And even the world famous Swiss-Surn physics laboratory uses old fashioned magnetic tape reels to record its data.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yes, it seems that some old technology just refuses to die.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Maybe because people still love it, or maybe because of the old English proverb,

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Meaning that things should only be changed if they don't work.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So, in this programme, we'll be hearing about old tech which continues to be used today.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And as usual, we'll be learning some useful new vocabulary as well.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But first, I have a question for you, Georgie.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Computers have seen some of the biggest advances in technology.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But what was the name of the first computer developed for home use in the UK?

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Was it A, the Commodore 64, B, the Sinclair ZX80, or C, the BBC Micro?

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hmm, I guess it was the Commodore 64.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Okay, Georgie, we'll find out if that's the correct answer later in the programme.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
One reason for not updating tech is if the original design still works well.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
NASA, engineer Jonathan Souda, designed Harvey, a mechanical rover able to survive the inhospitable conditions on Venus,

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
where temperatures reach 460 degrees Celsius.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Here's Jonathan talking to BBC World Service programme TechLife.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Venus has a very long night.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's actually about 60 days long that you're in total darkness.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So that's where we came up with a concept for Harvey, a mechanical clockwork rover that could be powered by Venus's winds in order to allow it to survive Venus's long, hot nights.

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Conditions on Venus mean that ordinary electronics simply won't work.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's why Jonathan built a clockwork rover, a machine with springs and wheels inside, which works when it's wound up with a key.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Clockwork technology from the first century being used in 2024 by NASA.

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Other tech which refuses to die is just too much trouble to change.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:17,000
For example, countries around the world use different electrical plugs, which would be better to standardise, but imagine the work involved.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Here, Chris Fallance, presenter of BBC World Services TechLife, discusses a similar example with Dr. Tasey Phillipson, science curator at the National Museum of Scotland.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Another piece of tech that people say has refused to die is the Quirty keyboard, the layout of keyboards that we all have.

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And it's perhaps not the most efficient layout in terms of the speed of typing.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's the layout we're all really, really used to, though.

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And if you see court reporters, stenographers, they have special keyboards and can type so fast to take down verbatim.

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
They also look very complicated and I don't actually want to learn to use one of those, so I'll stick with Quirty for the moment.

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Chris and Tasey discussed Quirty, the traditional typewriter arrangement of keys on a computer keyboard, in which the top line begins with the letters Q, W, E, R, T and Y.

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:24,000
In terms of being able to type quickly, Quirty isn't the best. In fact, court reporters type much faster with alternative keyboards.

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Court reporters need to type fast to record cases verbatim using exactly the same words that were originally spoken.

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But because everyone is used to Quirty keyboards, the tech lives on. That's why Tasey says she'll stick with Quirty. She'll continue using it and not change to something else.

47
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And speaking of Quirty keyboards has reminded me of my question, Georgie.

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes, you asked me the name of the first home computer released in the UK. And I guess it was the Commodore 64.

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Which was the wrong answer I'm afraid. In fact, the UK's first home computer was the Sinclair ZX80, which was released in 1980 and used a whopping 4 kilobyte memory.

50
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That's about half an email. Okay, it's time to recap the vocabulary we've learnt in this program, starting with obsolete.

51
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Meaning no longer in use, having been replaced by something newer or better.

52
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The idiom if it ain't or isn't broke, don't fix it, is used to say that if something is working, there's no reason to try to change it.

53
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Clockwork machinery uses metal springs and wheels, which move when they're wound up with a key.

54
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Quirty refers to the traditional typewriter arrangement of keys in which the top line begins with the letters Q, W, E, R, T and Y.

55
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
If you say something verbatim, you use exactly the same words that were originally used.

56
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And finally, to stick with something means to continue using or doing it.

57
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Once again, our six minutes are up. But remember to join us again next time for more trending topics and useful vocabulary. Here at six minute English. Goodbye for now.

58
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Bye.
