4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,919
Hello, welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil, and joining me is Rob.

5
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:16,800
Hello.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,760
Today, we'll be discussing whether wearing high heel shoes is a fashion statement

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,440
or a sign of oppression.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,920
And by that, I mean something you have to wear because someone has told you to.

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,079
Now, Neil, whatever style of shoe you choose to wear, it's good to polish them

10
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,240
and keep them looking shiny and new.

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,280
But one man from India called Vicrent Mahajan set the Guinness World Record

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,280
for polishing the most shoes.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,640
Do you know how many pairs he polished in eight hours?

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:52,240
Was it a 151 pairs, b 251 pairs, or c 351 pairs?

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,799
Well, if it was me, it would be no more than one pair,

16
00:00:54,799 --> 00:01:00,000
but as it's a world record, I'm going to go for 351 pairs.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,559
Hopefully, you'll give me the answer later.

18
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,359
But let's focus now on high heels.

19
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,599
Yes, it's a style of shoe worn by women around the world.

20
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,879
But why do millions of people choose to walk on strange, still-like shoes?

21
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,079
Studies have suggested wearing high heels can lead to damage to the muscles and skeleton.

22
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,679
But despite this, they are worn to look professional in the workplace

23
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,560
or for glamour, a word to describe the quality of looking fashionable and attractive.

24
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,440
And of course, they're associated with female glamour,

25
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,080
which is something Tim Edwards, honorary fellow in sociology at the University of Leicester,

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,719
has been talking about on the BBC Radio 4 programme Thinking Allowed.

27
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:42,880
Here he is describing why he thinks that is.

28
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,000
Women's shoes in particular can have this kind of transformative or even magical quality.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,959
They can do something for a woman.

30
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,640
And it's quite difficult to draw parallels quite like that with men,

31
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,920
as a sense in which it becomes something slightly otherworldly.

32
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,080
However, one views it as something which is an act of subordination or an act of empowerment,

33
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,360
etc.

34
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,520
There is a sense in which your experience is changed.

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,639
You are suddenly raised 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6.

36
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,039
It's higher, your balance is altered, your experience is transformed.

37
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:27,279
So he describes high heels as having a magical quality.

38
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:32,159
He uses the word transformative, meaning a great improvement or positive change,

39
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,119
so they transform or improve how someone looks.

40
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:40,239
Well, they do make you taller and that can make you feel more powerful or important.

41
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,359
Tim even said it becomes otherworldly,

42
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:48,399
an adjective to describe belonging to an imaginary world, rather than the real world.

43
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,280
Magical shoes do sound otherworldly,

44
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,319
but Tim also mentioned that wearing high heels could be seen as an act of subordination.

45
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,439
That's making someone do something to give them less authority or power.

46
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,640
Well, I guess that's only if you're forced to wear them,

47
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,120
but there's another interesting point here.

48
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,319
Men don't have a style of footwear that can define them.

49
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,439
Yes, it's just sandals for you and sports trainers for me.

50
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,759
In fact, Tim Edwards says it's difficult to draw parallels with men's shoes

51
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:20,319
when you draw parallels between two distinct things.

52
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,399
It means you highlight the similarities.

53
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:25,519
But here he's saying it's difficult to find similarities.

54
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,159
Men have nothing special to wear on their feet.

55
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,599
Of course, there's nothing to stop men wearing high heels.

56
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,280
Although, personally, I don't think I'd be able to keep my balance.

57
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,479
But Tim Edwards suggests it will be viewed with suspicion.

58
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,680
Let's hear what he has to say.

59
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:46,719
I think the issue with men and footwear is that if you think of more contemporary culture,

60
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:51,120
men are a guy who wears overly flamboyant shoes or shoes

61
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,919
which are not black brown or flat.

62
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:56,319
It is viewed with a degree of suspicion,

63
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,479
either in terms of his sexuality or in terms of his work ethic,

64
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:06,479
or in terms of his general moral standard in other kinds of ways.

65
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,919
He says that if you don't wear a regular, ordinary black, brown, or flat style of shoe,

66
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,000
you might be viewed with suspicion.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,319
Men who wear shoes that are flamboyant,

68
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,120
that's brightly coloured and that attract attention,

69
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,399
have their sexuality or their attitude to work judged.

70
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,560
He mentions someone's work ethic.

71
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,599
That's the belief that working hard is morally right.

72
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:31,680
A man who wears flamboyant shoes may have a different attitude to work.

73
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,519
Sounds like quite an old-fashioned view.

74
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,240
It does.

75
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,079
And let's hope people don't judge you when you go out wearing your sandals and socks.

76
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,560
Now, how about giving us the answer to the question you said earlier?

77
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,519
Yes, I told you about Vikrant Mahajan,

78
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,799
who set the Guinness World Record for polishing the most shoes.

79
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:52,399
I asked if you knew how many pairs he polished in eight hours.

80
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,519
And I guessed, 351 pairs.

81
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,719
Come on, was I right?

82
00:04:56,719 --> 00:04:57,839
I'm afraid not Neil.

83
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,479
The answer was 251 pairs.

84
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:01,599
It's still quite a lot.

85
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:04,879
That's 502 individual shoes.

86
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:07,439
And I'm not sure if he actually got paid for doing it.

87
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,799
Right, let's polish up some of our English vocabulary and remind ourselves of some of the words

88
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,680
we've discussed today, starting with oppression.

89
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,840
Oppression is when you're forced to do something by someone more powerful.

90
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,800
We talked about glamour, a word to describe the quality of looking fashionable and attractive.

91
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,160
Our next word was transformative, meaning a great improvement or positive change.

92
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,240
Otherworldly is an adjective to describe belonging to an imaginary world,

93
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,680
rather than the real world.

94
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,280
It's magical or special.

95
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,920
We also discussed an act of subordination.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,319
That's making someone do something to give them less authority or power.

97
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,240
To draw parallels is an idiom, meaning to highlight the similarities between two distinct things.

98
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,240
And we mentioned flamboyant.

99
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,120
That describes someone or something brightly coloured and that attracts attention.

100
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,280
Finally, we talked about work ethic.

101
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,080
That's the belief that working hard is morally right, something that both Neil and I have.

102
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,759
And that brings us to the end of the program.
