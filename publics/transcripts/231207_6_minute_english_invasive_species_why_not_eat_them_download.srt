00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello, this is 6 Minute English from BBCLearningEnglish. I'm Phil.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And I'm Beth.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today we're going to be talking about an interesting approach to the problem of invasive species.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
When animals or plants are introduced to new areas, they can be dangerous for existing wildlife.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Tell me about it. Every time I plant something in my garden squirrels dig it up.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm getting really fed up with them.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Have you tried eating them?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Sorry, what eat the squirrels?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's right. One of the simplest ways to deal with invasive species is just to eat them.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
In this program, we'll be hearing about initiatives in the UK and Belize

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
that are trying to get people to improve things using their stomachs.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Okay, but before that, I've got a question for you Phil.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Lionfish are aggressive predators which hunt over 50 different varieties of fish.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
To help them do this, their stomachs can expand.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But by how much?

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Is it A, 10 times its original size?

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
B, 30 times or C, 50 times?

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Well, those numbers all seem incredibly big. I mean, he can't be more than 10 times.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Come here.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Well, I will reveal the answer later in the program.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Before that, let's get back to your squirrel problem.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
There's a restaurant in London that offers squirrel cababs.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
They specialize in food made from invasive species.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So if that's not your taste, you could try Japanese knotweed beer.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This invasive plant has caused a lot of problems in the UK.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But just why is it so damaging?

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Host of BBC World Service Programme, People Fixing the World, Myra Anubi explains.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Japanese knotweed is an extremely invasive plant that arrived in Europe from Japan over a century ago.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This superweed doesn't just grow fast.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It has root systems that are so strong and resilient that they can withstand Morton Lava,

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
choke out surrounding plants and cause a lot of damage to buildings.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Myra tells us that Japanese knotweed is resilient.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If something or someone is resilient, then it means that it or they can resist attempts to stop them.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And another word for resist is withstand.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If you can withstand an attack or damage, then you don't let it affect you.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We heard that Japanese knotweed's roots can withstand lava from a volcano.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We also heard that Japanese knotweed can choke out other plants.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
By this, we mean that it takes the space and the resources such as light and water that they need to survive.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
A knotweed is not the only invasive species problem with a tasty solution.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:18,000
In Belize, since 2008, Lionfish have had a massive impact on coral reefs and native wildlife.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
They can eat four times as much as native species.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
BBC World Service Programme People Fixing the World went to investigate.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Here's Marisol Amaya talking to Salso Show from Marine Conservation NGO Blue Ventures

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
about attempts by the Belizean government to get people to eat Lionfish.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
With a big campaign slogan, eat the lion.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:53,000
They got renowned chefs to prepare it in exotic ways to raise awareness that eating Lionfish was both tasty and helping the environment.

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We have developed awareness for the restaurants to purchase it.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I think we had a lot of outreach trying to ensure fishers, the general public how to remove the spine.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Then that allows them to actually eat the meat from the fish.

51
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We heard that the Belizean government asked renowned chefs to prepare Lionfish dishes.

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Renowned means to be well known for being very good at something.

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Salso Show talked about outreach work.

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Outreach is where an organisation brings their work to people through events or publicity.

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Fisheries are either the businesses that breed and catch fish to sell or the places where that happens.

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So in Belize, people are being shown attractive ways to eat Lionfish.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And speaking of Lionfish and eating, I think it's time I revealed the answer to our quiz, Phil.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I asked you by how much can a Lionfish expand its stomach to eat more?

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And I thought it was ten times.

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But you were wrong, unfortunately, a Lionfish can actually make its stomach 30 times bigger.

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That might help to explain why they are such a danger to native Belizean fish.

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Okay, now let's recap the vocabulary that we've looked at today.

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
If something is resilient, then it's very hard to damage.

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yes, you could say that it can withstand a lot of damage. It can cope with it.

65
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If one plant chokes out another, then it takes away the resources needed to live.

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
If you are renowned for something, then you're famous for what you do.

67
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Outreach is how organisations bring their work to people.

68
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Fisheries are the companies that catch and sell fish or the places where they do it.

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's all we've got time for today.

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Maybe you might want to see if there are any invasive species near you that you might want to eat.

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
See you next time.

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Bye.
