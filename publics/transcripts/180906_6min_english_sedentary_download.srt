5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,280
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English, I'm Catherine.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,160
And I'm Dan.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,960
Now Dan, would you say you had a sedentary lifestyle at all?

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,039
If I only went to work, yes, I would have a pretty sedentary life.

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,359
I sit on the tube, I sit at my desk or in the studio for most of the day.

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,079
But because I know that's not good for my health,

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,359
I do also like to go to the gym a couple of times a week.

12
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,439
And I'll do some exercise like a bike ride or playing football at the weekend.

13
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,879
So my job is pretty sedentary, but not my life.

14
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,079
Nice answer, Dan.

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,640
And our topic today is about how one country in particular

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,760
has been very successful in dealing with the problem of a sedentary population.

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,519
But before we find out more, here's today's question.

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:04,000
According to a recent survey, how long does an average person in the UK

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,640
spend sitting down every day?

20
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,079
Is it a between six and seven hours,

21
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,159
b between seven and eight hours or c between eight and nine hours?

22
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,640
So Dan, what do you think?

23
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,000
Based on my day, it would be between eight and nine hours,

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
but I don't know if I'm an average person.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,480
So I'm interested to learn the answer for myself.

26
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,359
We'll find out the answer later in the program.

27
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:36,880
Now, 40 years ago, Finland was perhaps an unhealthiest country in the Western world,

28
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,760
but now it's one of the healthiest.

29
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,240
Death by heart disease in Finland has fallen by 80 percent.

30
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,880
And life expectancy, the age at which the average person lives until,

31
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,880
has risen by 10 years.

32
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,719
How has this been achieved?

33
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,640
This was investigated on BBC Radio 4's You and Yours program,

34
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,760
and one of the ways Finland has improved the health of the nation is by a lot of state involvement.

35
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,719
BBC reporter John Lawrenceon describes in a humorous way how this works.

36
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,719
How does he describe someone with many health problems?

37
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:23,520
If you're an exercise shurker because you're fat or old or asmatic or

38
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,120
chain to your computer or just plain lazy or all of those things rolled into one super-health

39
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,840
disaster zone, they will come to you in the form perhaps of a stern lady with a clipboard

40
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,159
and make some firm suggestions.

41
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:44,000
They won't actually drag you off your PlayStation out of your nursing home or out of the pub,

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,439
but they do get quite close.

43
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,240
How did he describe someone with a lot of health problems, Dan?

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,039
Well, he wasn't very complimentary, and we should emphasise that this report is quite

45
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:00,400
tongue in cheek, which means that it's meant to be funny and shouldn't be taken seriously.

46
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,520
But he called the people with many health problems, super-health disaster zones.

47
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:11,120
Super-health disaster zones, so what other vocabulary can we pick from what he said?

48
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,159
He talked about being an exercise shurker.

49
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,039
A shurker is someone who avoids doing something, usually because they're being lazy.

50
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,120
It's also a verb to shurker.

51
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:27,840
Lawrencein says that if you're an exercise shurker or indeed a super-health disaster zone,

52
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,759
someone from the authorities will come and visit you.

53
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:39,359
In another tongue in cheek description, he says that this visitor might be a stern lady with a

54
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:40,319
clipboard.

55
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,039
Stern is an adjective which means very serious and strict.

56
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,239
Someone without a sense of humour who might be quite angry.

57
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,079
And in his description, the reporter says that this stern lady will have a clipboard.

58
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:59,759
It's a hard board you can attach papers to so you can write on the paper while you're moving around.

59
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:06,319
So we have this image of an angry lady arriving at your house to tell you off for your health

60
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,439
habits and make you live a healthier life.

61
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:15,039
But he does point out that they won't actually drag you out of your house to do exercise.

62
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,839
However, in the report he goes on to say that there is a lot of encouragement,

63
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,519
even from school age, to eat well and take regular exercise.

64
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:29,759
Well, before a stern lady with a clipboard comes and tells us off for not finishing on time,

65
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,759
let's get the answer to today's quiz.

66
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,560
According to a recent survey, how long does the average person in the UK spend sitting down

67
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,800
every day? Is it eight between six and seven hours,

68
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,240
be between seven and eight hours, or say between eight and nine hours?

69
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
And I said I had no idea.

70
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,480
Well, the answer was say done between eight and nine hours.

71
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,959
In fact, it was eight and a quarter hours.

72
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,360
By comparison, in Finland, it's less than six hours.

73
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,240
I guess we're a lot more sedentary in Britain.

74
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,480
And sedentary is the first word in our vocabulary review.

75
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,599
It's an adjective used to describe a lifestyle which involves a lot of sitting

76
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,599
and not much exercise.

77
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:19,279
And if you're very sedentary, it can lead to a lower life expectancy,

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,599
life expectancy, the age to which you're expected to live.

79
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,360
Next, we have the word sugar for someone who avoids doing something they don't like,

80
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,039
usually because they're lazy.

81
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,360
For example, an exercise sugar avoids exercise.

82
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:41,439
Something that is said tongue in cheek is meant to be humorous and not taken seriously.

83
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,360
If you're stern though, you want to be taken seriously.

84
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,959
It's an adjective that means serious and strict.

85
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,039
And finally, there's clipboard.

86
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,959
A board you attach papers to so you write on them as you walk around.

87
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,879
Well done, it's time for us to go and get some exercise.

88
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,399
